We analyzed longitudinal data from the Hypersomnia Foundation Registry at CoRDS to evaluate changes in symptoms and medication usage over time. Registry participants reporting a diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia were included if they completed the registry questionnaire at least twice, with at least six months before first and last questionnaire. Responses were analyzed using paired t-test for continuous variables and McNemar test for categorical variables, comparing first and last responses. Data from three hundred twenty-three participants were included, with a mean age 35.0 ± 12.2 and 86.5 % women. Average time between first and last response was 2.4 ± 1.4 years. Symptoms remained largely stable over the 2 ½ year period, with persistent difficulty awakening (in 78.7 % at baseline and 73.0 % at follow up), daytime sleepiness (62.7 % and 61.8 %), trouble waking up and functioning with normal alertness (56.4 % and 56.4 %), requiring multiple alarms (53.4 % and 55.3 %), brain fog (46.3 % and 48.4 %), and memory problems (42.7 % and 43.4 %). Average nightly sleep duration on workdays and non-workdays and average nap duration were all stable over time. Participants made an average of 0.8 ( ± 1.1) medication changes, with most (55.4 %) participants remaining on the same medications. Comorbid mood disorders were relatively common, with a modest increase in anxiety diagnoses. Symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia remained relatively stable over an average of 2.4 years of follow up. Despite persistent symptoms being experienced by the majority of participants, medication changes were infrequent.","2025","2025 Jun 01","Audrika Chattaraj; Amanda A Freeman; Kendall J Nichols; Jason C Ong; David T Plante; Prabhjyot Saini; Catherine Friederich Murray; Rebecca King; Donald L Bliwise; Lynn Marie Trotti","Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Center for the Study of Human Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Department of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, USA; Sleep Center, Emory Healthcare, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Director of Behavioral Sleep Medicine and Clinical Science, Nox Health, Inc, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin Madison, WI, USA.; Department of Human Genetics and Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Prior Founding Board Member, Hypersomnia Foundation, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Current Board Member, Hypersomnia Foundation, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Department of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, USA; Sleep Center, Emory Healthcare, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Department of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, USA; Sleep Center, Emory Healthcare, Atlanta, GA, USA.

Persistent neurologic and behavioral sequelae including fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, headache, memory loss, and cognitive complaints are common. Although there is increasing evidence related to treatment of physical symptoms such as fatigue through physical rehabilitation practices, to date there is very limited evidence about the efficacy of various treatment regimens directed at nonphysical symptoms such as cognitive concerns and behavioral sequelae. This case series discusses a series of 13 patients with PASC who underwent individualized multidisciplinary outpatient cognitive rehabilitation at a quaternary medical center. In this patient population, the median age was 46 years (Q1, Q3: 41, 50), 77% were women, and 85% were White. The median time from infection to treatment was 229 days (Q1, Q3: 117, 367) and median length of stay in the program was 4.9 months (Q1, Q3: 3.1, 6.3). A history of depression and anxiety was found in 38% and 46% of this population, respectively. On admission and at discharge, the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 Participation Index, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory-22 were completed. After individualized outpatient cognitive therapy, no clear benefit was seen in any of the outcome measures. The ongoing investigation is important to better understand which approaches will benefit these patients.","2025","2025 Mar","Ellen Farr; Dmitry Esterov; Blake A Kassmeyer; Ryan J Lennon; Thomas F Bergquist","Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.; Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.; Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN."

This is characterized by difficulties in executive functions, planning, decision-making, working memory, impairments in complex attention, loss of ability to learn new skills and perform sophisticated brain tasks. No effective treatment options currently exist for LC-related cognitive dysfunction. Here, we use the IntelliCage, which is an automated tracking system of cognitive functions, following SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, measuring the ability of each mouse within a group to perform tasks that mimic complex human behaviors, such as planning, decision-making, cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Artificial intelligence and machine learning analyses of the tracking data classified LC mice into distinct behavioral categories from non-infected control mice, permitting precise identification and quantification of complex cognitive dysfunction in a controlled, replicable manner. Importantly, we find that brains from LC mice with cognitive dysfunction exhibit transcriptomic alterations similar to those observed in humans suffering from LC-related cognitive impairments, including altered expression of genes involved in learning, executive functions, synaptic functions, neurotransmitters and memory. Together, our findings establish a validated murine model and an automated unbiased approach to study LC-related cognitive dysfunction for the first time, and providing a valuable tool for screening potential treatments and therapeutic interventions.","2025","2025 May 15","Heba M Amer; Mohamed M Shamseldin; Sarah Faber; Mostafa Eltobgy; Amy Webb; Rabab El-Mergawy; Michelle Chamblee; Richard Perez; Owen Whitham; Asmaa Badr; Gauruv Gupta; Jihad Omran; Destiny Bissel; Jacob Yount; Estelle Cormet-Boyaka; Prosper N Boyaka; Jianrong Li; Xiaoli Zhang; Mark E Peeples; K C Mahesh; Maciej Pietrzak; Stephanie Seveau; Olga Kokiko-Cochran; Magdi Amer; Ruth M Barrientos; Andrew Schamess; Eugene Oltz; Amal O Amer",""

Relative to other tissues the brain is enriched in the omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic (DHA), with well-defined neurophysiological roles for both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA. Substantial preclinical and epidemiological evidence along with accumulating randomised controlled trial (RCT) data indicates that an increase in EPA and DHA intake and status is associated with improved brain function. In this narrative review, the role of EPA and DHA in the menopausal transition (MT) is considered. The evidence, although relatively sparse, is indicative of benefit, with future RCTs needed to establish dose-response relationships and when it is most beneficial to intervene. Although research is at a relatively early stage, the MT is emerging as a critical window of intervention opportunity not only to support MT well-being but also lifelong health in women.","2025","2025 May 30","Anne Marie Minihane","Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia (UEA), Norwich, UK.; Norwich Institute of Healthy Ageing (NIHA), Centre for Lifespan Health, UEA, Norwich, UK."

This study investigates the significant impact of work participation and disability on the mental wellbeing, health-related quality of life, and disease-related outcomes in individuals with SLE. With the objective of creating an SLE-related functional profile rooted in work disability (WD) prevention, 46 SLE patients were purposively recruited from Canadian medical centres. Through semi-structured interviews guided by a WD prevention framework, factors associated with WD and lived experiences of SLE-related WD were qualitatively explored. Braun and Clarke's six-stage inductive thematic analysis was used to organize the data. Most participants experienced some form of work disability across their employment history related to their clinical manifestations of SLE, including hospitalizations, physical limitations, fatigue, and neurocognitive symptoms (e.g. brain fog). Thematic analysis revealed three key themes: (a) the influence of illness experience on work, (b) the stigmatization of illness disclosure, and (c) the availability of workplace resources/accommodations. Participants emphasized the desirability of work with reduced physical and mental demands, increased personal control, and workplace flexibility to prevent WD. The study underscores the need for a collaborative, multi-component, and multidisciplinary intervention targeting psychosocial and workplace factors to establish a goal-oriented preventative framework, potentially improving WD outcomes in SLE individuals.","2025","2025 May 26","Behdin Nowrouzi-Kia; Aaron S Howe; Anson Li; Jeremy Tan; Natalia Saade-Cleves; Kevon Jules; Malak Sadek; Ali Bani-Fatemi; Antonio Avina-Zubieta; Mary T Fox; William Shaw; Derek Haaland; Janet Pope; Paul R Fortin; Kathleen S Bingham; Christine Peschken; Jennifer Reynolds; Catherine Ivory; Dafna D Gladman; Murray B Urowitz; Jorge Sanchez-Guerrero; Lily S H Lim; Stephanie Keeling; Patti Katz; Mahta Kavkan; Dennisse Bonilla; Wils Nielsen; Zahi Touma","ReSTORE Lab, Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, 500 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1V7, Canada. behdin.nowrouzi.kia@utoronto.ca.; Krembil Research Institute-University Health Network, 60 Leonard Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5T 0S8, Canada. behdin.nowrouzi.kia@utoronto.ca.; Centre for Research in Occupational Safety & Health, Laurentian University, 935 Ramsey Lake Rd, Sudbury, ON, P3E 2C6, Canada. behdin.nowrouzi.kia@utoronto.ca.; ReSTORE Lab, Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, 500 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1V7, Canada.; ReSTORE Lab, Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, 500 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1V7, Canada.; ReSTORE Lab, Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, 500 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1V7, Canada.; ReSTORE Lab, Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, 500 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1V7, Canada.; University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.; ReSTORE Lab, Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, 500 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1V7, Canada.; University of British Columbia / Arthritis Research Canada, British Colombia, Canada.; School of Nursing, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada.; School of Medicine, University of Connecticut, Farmington, CT, USA.; The Waterside Clinic, Barrie, ON, Canada.; St. Joseph's Health Care, London, ON, Canada.; Centre de recherche du CHU Québec, Université Laval (CHUL), Québec, Québec, Canada.; Centre for Mental Health, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.; University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.; Mary Pack Arthritis Program, Vancouver Arthritis Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; The Ottawa Hospital Arthritis Centre, Division of Rheumatology, Ottawa, ON, Canada.; Schroeder Arthritis Institute, Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.; Centre for Prognosis Studies in Rheumatic Diseases, University of Toronto Lupus Clinic, Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, Canada.; University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Schroeder Arthritis Institute, Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.; Centre for Prognosis Studies in Rheumatic Diseases, University of Toronto Lupus Clinic, Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, Canada.; University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.; Division of Rheumatology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, USA.; Schroeder Arthritis Institute, Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.; Centre for Prognosis Studies in Rheumatic Diseases, University of Toronto Lupus Clinic, Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, Canada.; Schroeder Arthritis Institute, Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.; Centre for Prognosis Studies in Rheumatic Diseases, University of Toronto Lupus Clinic, Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, Canada.; University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Centre for Prognosis Studies in Rheumatic Diseases, University of Toronto Lupus Clinic, Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, Canada.; Schroeder Arthritis Institute, Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.; Centre for Prognosis Studies in Rheumatic Diseases, University of Toronto Lupus Clinic, Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, Canada."

This case series of seven patients seeks to identify changes in migraines following COVID-19 infection and discuss the mechanisms by which these changes may have occurred. The study was composed of seven subjects with prior COVID-19 infection and a preceding history of migraine disorder. Most of the subjects presented with increased frequency and intensity of migraines shortly or immediately following COVID-19 infection. Many also described a shift in pain from local to diffuse headache. Additionally, some subjects developed other neuropsychiatric symptoms consistent with long COVID that included brain fog and, unusually, aphasia. After COVID-19 infection, six subjects had reduced efficacy for their medications and had to alter their regimen. Standard treatments such as Botox and anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (anti-GCRP) had varied success among the cases. It is important to note that the pathophysiology of migraines during COVID-19 is still unclear and other factors can play a role.

Yet research to date has not compared these patients with healthy controls with a history of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, making it difficult to understand why certain COVID patients develop post-COVID cognitive symptoms while others do not. The objective of this pilot study was to compare two groups of laboratory-confirmed post-COVID patients, with and without cognitive symptoms, on measures of cognitive and psychological functioning, self-reported perceptions of functional status and quality of life, and biomarkers of stress, inflammation, and neuroplasticity. Using a case-control design, 17 participants were recruited from a healthcare system in western Michigan, USA in 2022-2024. All participants were aged 25-65 and had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test confirming previous COVID-19 infection. Ten participants reported cognitive symptoms (long COVID group) while seven were fully recovered with no residual symptoms (controls). All participants underwent an interview on their self-rated health and quality of life, a battery of neurocognitive tests, and blood draw for biomarker analysis. No group differences were detected for neuropsychological test measures except for letter fluency where the long COVID group scored significantly lower (p < .05). The long COVID group had significantly lower ratings than controls on quality of life, physical health, emotional functioning, and psychological well-being. Serum levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), a biomarker of brain plasticity, were significantly lower in the long COVID group, which was significantly more likely than controls to have serum levels of inflammatory marker (interleukin (IL)-10) values greater than or equal to the median (p = 0.015). Biomarker analyses suggest possible prolonged inflammatory processes in long COVID patients compared to fully recovered patients. Results of decreased neuroplastic functioning give credence to patients' reports of post-COVID changes in brain function.","2025","2025","Michael R Lawrence; Judith E Arnetz; Scott E Counts; Aiesha Ahmed; Bengt B Arnetz","Division of Clinical Neuropsychology, Corewell Health, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Neurology, Corewell Health, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Family Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Family Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Translational Neuroscience, College of Human Medicine, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Neurology, Corewell Health, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Family Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America."

Also, associated comorbidities such as sensory hyperreflexia may play an important role in affecting patient's quality of life. We reviewed a Taiwan series of patients diagnosed with VM to better understand the features and comorbidities associated with VM and also to determine whether there are regional differences in the presentation of VM. We retrospectively reviewed medical records from all patients diagnosed with VM between 2020.04 and 2023.03 and extracted data on chief complaints, interview records, and physical, laboratory and imaging results. VM was re-categorized according to the International Headache Society-Bárány (IHS- Bárány) diagnostic criteria as definite or probable VM. Among 393 Taiwanese patients diagnosed with VM, 74.3 % had definite VM, and 25.7 % had probable VM. Dizziness was most frequently associated with recurrent migraine headaches (91.6 %) and phonophobia (60.3 %). Chronic cervicalgia (58.0 %) was the most common non-criteria symptom. While 36.6-54.5 % of patients had otologic symptoms suggestive of Meniere's disease, only 5.1 % had both ""definite"" VM and ""definite"" Meniere's disease by diagnostic criteria. Beyond the VM diagnostic criteria, symptoms like chronic cervicalgia, osmophobia, brain fog, and chronic or fluctuating tinnitus significantly correlated with ""definite VM"" in a multivariate regression model. VM is not solely due to vestibular or central issues; it is closely linked to various systemic comorbidities that can worsen VM and significantly impact quality of life. This study aims to deepen understanding of VM symptoms in Taiwanese and identify potential gaps in interpreting diagnostic criteria, accounting for cultural and linguistic variations. By examining these aspects, we aim to gain insights into the complex nature of VM and advance more effective diagnostic and treatment approaches.","2025","2025 May 13","Yu-Hsi Liu; I-Jung Feng","Institute of Biomedical Science, National Sun-Yat-Sen University, Taiwan; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, No.386, Dazhong 1st Rd., Zuoying Dist., Kaohsiung City, 81362, Taiwan.

Wilson disease (WD) patients have a chronic liver and/or neuropsychiatric disease, making it particularly interesting to investigate LC in WD. 51 WD patients were retrospectively examined, evaluating physical and mental health by a survey and neuropsychological tests (SF-12, PSQI, ISI, Epworth, Chalder-fatigue scale, PHQ-9, GAD-7, PSS, FLei) before and ~11 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. LC was defined as the development of new, at least moderately severe symptoms (shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, brain fog, exercise capacity, concentration disturbances) and/or worsening of pre-existing symptoms. 70.6% had predominant hepatic and 29.4% had neuropsychiatric symptoms at WD diagnosis. Median age was 39 years; 56.1% were female. Patients were in stable maintenance phase with a median treatment duration of 23 years.

A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 75 participants, categorized into three groups: 24 healthy controls (HCs), 26 COVID-19 survivors without brain fog (woFOG), and 25 with brain fog (wFOG). Neuropsychological assessments included the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R). Structural and functional brain alterations were examined using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). The wFOG group exhibited significant cognitive impairments, particularly in delayed free recall, attention, memory, and visuospatial skills, compared to both the woFOG and HC groups. Structural MRI analyses revealed reduced gray matter concentrations (GMC) in the left inferior temporal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, and right orbital gyri in both COVID-19 groups relative to HCs. Additionally, the wFOG group exhibited further GMC reductions in the bilateral caudate nuclei, right putamen/pallidum, and amygdala compared to the woFOG group. rs-fMRI analyses demonstrated altered connectivity patterns in COVID-19 survivors, characterized by increased connectivity in the default mode network and visual networks, alongside decreased connectivity in the dorsal attention network. These findings indicate that even mild COVID-19 can result in persistent neurocognitive deficits, structural brain alterations, and functional network abnormalities, both in individuals with and without brain fog. The observed changes highlight the importance of long-term monitoring and targeted interventions to address potential cognitive and neurological consequences of long COVID.","2025","2025 Jun","Bedia Samanci; Ulaş Ay; Haşim Gezegen; Sanem Sultan Yörük; Alpay Medetalibeyoğlu; Elif Kurt; Erdi Şahin; Faruk Uğur Doğan; Mehmet Barbüroğlu; Başar Bilgiç; Haşmet Hanağası; Hakan Gürvit","Behavioral Neurology and Movement Disorders Unit, Department of Neurology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.

Yet, no empirically supported treatments exist. This study's objectives were to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy, provisionally, of a new rehabilitation approach, Constraint-Induced Cognitive Therapy (CICT), for post-COVID-19 cognitive sequelae. Sixteen community residents ≥3 months post-COVID-19 infection with mild cognitive impairment and dysfunction in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) were enrolled. Participants were randomized to Immediate-CICT or treatment as usual (TAU) with crossover to CICT. CICT combined behavior change techniques modified from Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy with Speed of Processing Training, a computerized cognitive training program. CICT was deemed feasible if (a) ≥ 80% of participants were adherent, (b) the same found treatment highly satisfying and at most moderately difficult, and (c) < 2 study-related, serious adverse events occurred. The primary outcome was IADL performance in daily life (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure). Employment status and brain fog (Mental Clutter Scale) were also assessed. Fourteen completed Immediate-CICT (n = 7) or TAU (n = 7); two withdrew from TAU before their second testing session. Completers were, M (SD): 10 (7) months post-COVID; 51 (13) years old; 10 females, four males; one African American, and 13 European American. All the feasibility benchmarks were met. Immediate-CICT, relative to TAU, produced very large improvements in IADL performance (M = 3.7 points, p < .001, d = 2.6) and brain fog (M = -4 points, p < .001, d = -2.9). Four of five nonretired Immediate-CICT participants returned to work posttreatment; no TAU participants did, p = .048.

These signs/symptoms can lead to difficulty walking, climbing stairs, and reduced manual dexterity. Detailed qualitative exploration of the patient experience of CIDP, notably signs/symptoms, its impacts on health-related quality of life, and treatment experience is limited. Qualitative patient experience data is recommended by regulatory bodies to inform patient-focused drug development. This study aimed to qualitatively explore the experience of CIDP from the patient and clinician perspectives. Qualitative concept elicitation telephone interviews were conducted with adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CIDP and with neurologists experienced in diagnosing and treating patients with CIDP from the USA. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis methods, and findings informed development of a conceptual model. Overall, 15 patients with CIDP and 10 neurologists were interviewed. A total of 19 signs/symptoms were identified as important and relevant, of which weakness, fatigue, loss of balance, tingling, numbness, pain, and loss of coordination were most frequently reported by patients and neurologists. Except for loss of coordination, these signs/symptoms were also considered most salient to patients. Patients identified fatigue as the most bothersome symptom and weakness and fatigue as the most important to treat. CIDP impacted health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), including physical functioning (e.g., walking difficulties), activities of daily living (e.g., difficulty with personal care), work (e.g., being unable to work), emotional wellbeing (e.g., depression), social wellbeing (e.g., participation in social/leisure activities), sleep (e.g., difficulty falling asleep), and cognition (e.g., brain fog). Patients reported that current CIDP treatments lacked effectiveness in treating specific symptoms, caused unwanted side effects, and impacted their independence. Findings contribute novel and detailed qualitative insights into the key signs/symptoms of CIDP and the profound impact of these on patients' HRQoL from both the patient and clinician perspectives. Findings can be used to identify treatment targets and support selection of appropriate clinical outcome assessments for the evaluation of CIDP symptoms and HRQoL impacts in future CIDP clinical trials.","2025","2025 Jun","Anna Roberts; Natasha Griffiths; Kieran Thiara; Sophie Wallace; Alyson L Young; Nicola Williamson; Adam Gater; Omar Saeed; Charles Minor; Natalia Hawken","Patient-Centered Outcomes, Adelphi Values, Bollington, UK.; Patient-Centered Outcomes, Adelphi Values, Bollington, UK.; Patient-Centered Outcomes, Adelphi Values, Bollington, UK.; Patient-Centered Outcomes, Adelphi Values, Bollington, UK.; Patient-Centered Outcomes, Adelphi Values, Bollington, UK.; Patient-Centered Outcomes, Adelphi Values, Bollington, UK.; Patient-Centered Outcomes, Adelphi Values, Bollington, UK. adam.gater@adelphivalues.com.; Sanofi UK, Reading, UK.; Sanofi, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Sanofi B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands."

Symptoms can last 7 or even more months. How long PCC persists and any changes in its clinical phenotypes over time require further investigation. We investigated PCC trajectories and factors associated with PCC persistence. We included both hospitalized COVID-19 patients and outpatients from February 2020 to June 2023, who underwent at least one follow-up visit after acute infection at San Paolo Hospital, University of Milan. Follow-up visits were conducted at the post COVID-19 clinic or via telemedicine. During each follow-up examination, patients completed a short version of the World Health Organization (WHO) Case Report Form (CRF) for ongoing symptoms, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and a screening tool for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Statistical analyses involved Chi-square, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and logistic regression analysis. We enrolled 853 patients (median age 62, IQR 52-73; 41% females). 551/853 (64.6%), 152/418 (36.4%) and 21/69 (30.4%) presented PCC at median follow up of 3 (IQR 2-3), 7 (IQR 6-10) and 26 (IQR 20-33) months, respectively (p < 0.001). The main clinical phenotypes were fatigue, respiratory sequelae, brain fog and chronic pain; anosmia/dysgeusia was observed mostly in the first post-acute period. Female sex, acute disease in 2020, a longer hospital stay and no COVID-19 vaccination were associated with persistence or resolution of PCC compared to never having had PCC. Anxiety, depression and PTSD were more common in PCC patients. By fitting a logistic regression analysis, acute infection in 2020 remained independently associated with persistent PCC, adjusting for age, sex, preexisting comorbidities and disease severity (AOR 0.479 for 2021 vs 2020, 95%CI 0.253-0.908, p = 0.024; AOR 0.771 for 2022 vs 2020, 95%CI 0.259-2.297, p = 0.641; AOR 0.086 for 2023 vs 2020, 95%CI 0.086-3.830, p = 0.565). There was a reduction in the PCC burden 7 months following the acute phase; still, one third of patients experienced long-lasting symptoms. The main clinical presentations of PCC remain fatigue, respiratory symptoms, brain fog, and chronic pain. Having had SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first pandemic phases appears to be associated with persistent PCC.","2025","2025 Apr 29","Andrea Santoro; Francesca Bai; Maria Francesca Greco; Roberta Rovito; Matteo Sala; Lidia Borghi; Kyrie Piscopo; Elena Vegni; Julia Fonseca de Morais Caporali; Carolina Coimbra Marinho; Arnaldo Santos Leite; Maria Mercedes Santoro; Francesca Ceccherini Silberstein; Marco Iannetta; Dovile Juozapaite; Edita Strumiliene; André Almeida; Cristina Toscano; Jesus Arturo Ruiz Quinones; Luca Carioti; Chiara Mommo; Iuri Fanti; Francesca Incardona; Giulia Marchetti; ","Department of Health Sciences, Clinic of Infectious Diseases, San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo E Carlo, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.; Department of Health Sciences, Clinic of Infectious Diseases, San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo E Carlo, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.; Department of Health Sciences, Clinic of Infectious Diseases, San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo E Carlo, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.; Department of Health Sciences, Clinic of Infectious Diseases, San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo E Carlo, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.; Department of Health Sciences, Clinic of Infectious Diseases, San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo E Carlo, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.; Department of Health Sciences, Unit of Clinical Psychology, San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.; Department of Health Sciences, Unit of Clinical Psychology, San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.; Department of Health Sciences, Unit of Clinical Psychology, San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.; School of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.; School of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.; School of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.; Vilnius Santaros Klinikos Biobank, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.; Clinic of Infectious Diseases and Dermatovenerology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Medical Faculty, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.; Department of Internal Medicine 4, Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Lisboa Central, Centro Clínico Académico de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.; Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental, Lisbon, Portugal.; Hospital Juan Graham Casasus, Villahermosa, Tab, Mexico.; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.; EuResist Network GEIE, Rome, Italy.; EuResist Network GEIE, Rome, Italy.; EuResist Network GEIE, Rome, Italy.; InformaPRO S.R.L, Rome, Italy.; Department of Health Sciences, Clinic of Infectious Diseases, San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo E Carlo, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. giulia.marchetti@unimi.it."

The COVID-19 cohort was compared against influenza and pneumonia cohorts to assess whether risk of post-acute symptoms differed. Administrative health claims data were obtained for commercially insured and Medicare Advantage covered adults (≥ 18 years) with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 (n=121,205), and similar cohorts of influenza (n=20,844) and pneumonia (n=29,052) patients diagnosed prior to the pandemic. Post-acute symptoms were assessed at four weeks, three and six months following initial diagnosis. Among the patients with COVID-19, the likelihood of any post-acute symptom increased with initial disease severity, and was also influenced by the presence of comorbidities, especially rheumatoid arthritis, ischemic heart disease and asthma. The specific post-acute symptoms varied by age, with increased risks of anxiety and headache among the young, whereas the elderly experienced increased brain fog and fatigue. When compared against the influenza and pneumonia cohorts, all three groups experienced post-acute symptoms, with a strong relationship to disease severity, and only partial resolution over the six-month observation period. Those with influenza were less likely than those with COVID-19 to experience post-acute symptoms while those with pneumonia were more likely to have post-acute illness than those with COVID-19. Using a large national dataset, we found that COVID-19 symptomology could not be described by previously seen influenza or pneumonia symptomology and differences exist in the prevalence of symptoms as well as time to resolution, better characterizing ""long COVID"" and identifying that these differences are unique to COVID-19.","2025","2025","Caroline M Schaefer; Trudy Millard Krause; George L Delclos; Raymond S Greenberg","Department of Management, Policy and Community Health, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas United States of America.; Department of Management, Policy and Community Health, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas United States of America.; Southwest Center for Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas United States of America.; Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas United States of America."

It is estimated that approximately 10% of individuals who contact COVID-19 develop Long COVID, with fatigue and brain fog being among the most commonly reported and debilitating symptoms. However, no standardized or effective treatments are currently available. This observational study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of MYPplus, an herbal formulation composed of Astragali Radix, Salviae Radix, and Aquilariae Lignum, in alleviating fatigue and brain fog in patients with Long COVID. Subjects with a score of 60 or higher on the Modified Korean version of the Chalder Fatigue scale (mKCFQ11) or a brain fog rating of 5 or higher on the visual analogue scale (VAS) took two capsules of MYPplus (500 mg per capsule) twice daily for 4 weeks. Changes in symptoms were assessed using the mKCFQ11, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), Fatigue VAS, Brain fog VAS, and overall quality of life using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Additionally, levels of three cytokines (TNF-α, TGF-β, IFN- γ) and cortisol were measured. Fifty participants successfully completed the 4-week administration with MYPplus. At baseline, fatigue severity was 75.3 ± 10.9 in mKCFQ11, 70.9 ± 11.2 in MFI-20, 7.5 ± 1.2 in Fatigue VAS, 8.4 ± 1.1 in Brain fog VAS, and 45.3 ± 17.8 in SF-12. All parameters significantly improved (p < 0.01), with a decrease of 46% in mKCFQ11, 26% in MFI-20, 49% in Fatigue VAS, and 52% in Brain fog VAS, and an increase of 59% in SF-12, respectively. Unlikely others, the plasma level of TGF-β showed a declining pattern after MYPplus administration (from 765.0 ± 1759.7 to 243.9 ± 708.1 pg/mL, p = 0.07). No safety concerns were observed. This pilot observational study suggests the clinical potential of MYPplus for managing patients with Long COVID, focusing on fatigue-related symptoms and quality of life. Further studies are required to confirm its efficacy and safety using large-scale randomized placebo-controlled trials in the future.

"19","40261198","Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with Long COVID: A compendium statement.","PM & R : the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation","","","In 2021, the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation established the Multi-Disciplinary Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Collaborative to provide guidance from established Long COVID clinics for the evaluation and management of Long COVID. The collaborative previously published eight Long COVID consensus guidance statements using a primarily symptom-based approach. However, Long COVID symptoms most often do not occur in isolation. This compendium aims to equip clinicians with an efficient, up-to-date clinical resource for evaluating and managing adults experiencing Long COVID symptoms. The primary intended audience includes physiatrists, primary care physicians, and other clinicians who provide first-line assessment and management of Long COVID symptoms, especially in settings where subspecialty care is not readily available. This compendium provides a holistic framework for assessment and management, symptom-specific considerations, and updates on prevalence, health equity, disability considerations, pathophysiology, and emerging evidence regarding treatments under investigation. Because Long COVID closely resembles other infection-associated chronic conditions (IACCs) such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, the guidance in this compendium may also be helpful for clinicians managing these related conditions. Guidance in this compendium was developed by the collaborative's established modified Delphi approach. The collaborative is a multidisciplinary group whose members include physiatrists, primary care physicians, pulmonologists, cardiologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, neurologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech and language pathologists, patients, and government representatives. Over 40 Long COVID centers are represented in the collaborative. Long COVID is defined by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine as ""an IACC that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least 3 months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems."" The current global prevalence of Long COVID is estimated to be 6%. Higher prevalence has been identified among female gender, certain racial and ethnic groups, and individuals who live in nonurban areas. However, anyone can develop Long COVID after being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptom clusters. The most common symptoms include exaggerated fatigue and diminished energy windows, postexertional malaise (PEM)/postexertional symptom exacerbation (PESE), cognitive impairment (brain fog), dysautonomia, pain/myalgias, and smell and taste alterations. Holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated. A positive COVID-19 test during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is not required to diagnose Long COVID, and currently, there is no single laboratory finding that is definitively diagnostic for confirming or ruling out the diagnosis of Long COVID. A basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, and consideration for additional labs and diagnostic procedures is guided by the patient's specific symptoms. Current management strategies focus on symptom-based supportive care. Critical considerations include energy conservation strategies and addressing comorbidities and modifiable risk factors. Additionally, (1) it is essential to validate the patient's experience and provide reassurance that their symptoms are being taken seriously because many patients have had their symptoms dismissed by loved ones and clinicians; (2) physical activity recommendations must be carefully tailored to the patient's current activity tolerance because overly intense activity can trigger PEM/PESE and worsened muscle damage; and (3) treatment recommendations should be delivered with humility because there are many persistent unknowns related to Long COVID. To date, there are limited data to guide medication management specifically in the context of Long COVID. As such, medication use generally follows standard practice regarding indications and dosing, with extra attention to prioritize (1) patient preference via shared decision-making and (2) cautious use of medications that may improve some symptoms (eg, cognitive/attention impairment) but may worsen other symptoms (eg, PEM/PESE). Numerous clinical trials are investigating additional treatments. The return-to-work process for individuals with Long COVID can be challenging because symptoms can fluctuate, vary in nature, affect multiple functional areas (eg, physical and cognitive), and often manifest as an ""invisible disability"" that may not be readily acknowledged by employers or coworkers. Clinicians can help patients return to work by identifying suitable workplace accommodations and resources, providing necessary documentation, and recommending occupational or vocational therapy when needed. If these efforts are unsuccessful and work significantly worsens Long COVID symptoms or impedes recovery, applying for disability may be warranted. Long COVID is recognized as a potential disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. To contribute to the overall health and well-being for all patients, Long COVID care should be delivered in a holistic manner that acknowledges challenges faced by the patient and uncertainties in the field. For more detailed information on assessment and management of specific Long COVID symptoms, readers can reference the collaborative's symptom-specific consensus guidance statements.","2025","2025 Apr 22","Abby L Cheng; Eric Herman; Benjamin Abramoff; Jordan R Anderson; Alba Azola; John M Baratta; Matthew N Bartels; Ratna Bhavaraju-Sanka; Svetlana Blitshteyn; Jeffrey S Fine; Talya K Fleming; Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez; Joseph E Herrera; Rasika Karnik; Monica Kurylo; Michele T Longo; Mark D McCauley; Esther Melamed; Mitchell G Miglis; Jacqueline D Neal; Christina V Oleson; David Putrino; Leslie Rydberg; Julie K Silver; Carmen M Terzic; Jonathan H Whiteson; William N Niehaus","Division of Musculoskeletal Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.; Department of Family Medicine, Oregon Health & Sciences University, Portland, Oregon, USA.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Neurology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Adolescent Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, UNC-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Health System, Bronx, New York, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.; Department of Neurology, University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Buffalo, New York, USA.; Dysautonomia Clinic, Williamsville, New York, USA.; Associate Professor, Rehabilitation Medicine, Grossman NYU School of Medicine, Rusk Rehabilitation Medicine, Grossman NYU School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute at Hackensack Meridian Health, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, Edison, New Jersey, USA.; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.; Department of Rehabilitation and Human Performance, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.; Department of General Internal Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, University of Kansas Medical Center and Health System, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.; Tulane Department of Clinical Neurosciences, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Department of Physiology and Biophysics and the Center for Cardiovascular Research, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Department of Neurology, Dell Medical School, UT, Austin, Texas, USA.; Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA.; Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Jesse Brown VA, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Case Western Reserve University, MetroHealth Rehabilitation Institute, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; Department of Rehabilitation and Human Performance, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Senior Associate Dean for Faculty Experience and Success, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.; Professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.; Medical Director Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Program, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and Medicine, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, Colorado, USA."

Secondary outcomes included muscle strength, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), mental health, work status, laboratory tests, and examinations. Among 12,789 participants (media [IQR] age, 48.4 [37.3 to 61.4] years; 7817 females [61.1%]), 995 of them (7.8%) experienced long COVID within one year, with 651 (5.1%) having persistent symptoms. Fatigue (598/995 [60.1%]) and post-exertional malaise (367/995 [36.9%]) were the most common symptoms. Brain fog had the lowest resolution proportion as 4.2% within one year. The odds of long COVID increased with reinfections (odds ratios for one reinfection 2.592 [95% CI: 2.188 to 3.061]; two or more: 6.171 [3.227 to 11.557]; all p < 0.001). Participants with persistent long COVID had markedly lower muscle strength (upper-limb: 26.9 ± 12.4 vs. 29.1 ± 14.5 Kg; lower-limb: 40.0 [27.0 to 62.0] vs. 43.0 [28.0 to 59.0] s), worse exercise capacity and poorer HRQoL, and meaningful difference in laboratory tests results compared to those without long COVID. They also exhibited significantly higher proportions of abnormal lung function (FEV1 %pred<80%: 13.0% vs. 2.0%; DLco %pred<80%: 32.7% vs. 19.9%) and lung imaging abnormalities (23.5% vs. 13.6%). The considerable health burden of long COVID and the progression of neurological symptoms following Omicron infection warrant close monitoring. Utilizing professional questionnaires and developing reliable diagnostic tools are necessary for improving diagnosis and treatment of long COVID.

This is a retrospective cross-sectional and longitudinal study in a single-center tertiary care academic center. Participants include 240 patients with documented evidence of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antibody test who underwent initial evaluation and 182 patients with longitudinal follow-up. Main outcomes evaluated are patient demographics, duration of illness prior to self-reported improvement, and cognitive testing results-including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (version 8.2) (MoCA) and Oral Trail Making Test-B (OTMT-B). The majority (73%) of patients did not require hospitalization for their acute COVID-19 symptoms. Frequent Long COVID complaints included headache (60%), dizziness/vertigo (40%), and disturbance of taste/smell (40%). Almost all (94%) patients reported cognitive symptoms, and over 30% of patients had abnormal scores on cognitive testing. Severe infection, fewer years of education level, and non-White race were found to be statistically associated with an increased likelihood of having abnormal scores on cognitive testing. Neuroimaging and clinical laboratory testing were largely not informative for patient care. Sixty-two percent of patients with follow-up visits self-reported improvement in their primary neurological complaint within 1 year of evaluation. Performance on standardized cognitive screening tests may not be consistent with frequently reported cognitive complaints in Long COVID patients. The most common clinical trajectory was self-reported improvement in the primary neurological symptom.","2025","2025 Apr 08","Luana D Yamashita; Neel Desai; Abigail R Manning; Caitlin Pileggi; Sara Manning Peskin; Danielle K Sandsmark; Dennis L Kolson; Matthew K Schindler","Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."

This study tests the feasibility and initial impact of a digitally delivered mindful-walking (MW) intervention for improving the physical and psychosocial wellbeing of COVID-19 long haulers. We recruited 23 participants via Facebook groups, between March and November 2021, for a 4-week online MW intervention (i.e., 2 mindfulness practice sessions per week), that was delivered entirely through the study Facebook group. The intervention was assessed using mixed methods. Quantitative data were collected through brief daily evening surveys (i.e., 28 days) over the 4-week intervention period, and measured affect, cognition, mindfulness, physical activity, and MW engagement. Qualitative data were extracted from the Facebook group's Paradata (i.e., participant feedback, engagement metrics, and all social media interactions). Multilevel modeling was employed for the statistical analysis and a pragmatic approach was used for the qualitative analysis. The participants reported a high feasibility score (mean=4.93/7, SD=1.88), which was comprised of perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and ease of use. Those who engaged in MW, on any given day, frequently reported better psychosocial moods with more positive affect (β=0.89, p<0.01), less negative affect (β=-0.83, p<0.01), higher perceived cognitive ability (β=0.52, p<0.05), and more physical activity (β=0.41, p<0.05). Additionally, participants who practiced MW more consistently during the study reported higher levels of momentary mindfulness (β=0.3 p<0.01). Participants expressed satisfaction with the intervention, reporting benefits such as better symptom management and an overall improvement in wellbeing. Despite the small sample size, the digital delivery of our MW intervention via Facebook showed high acceptability. Preliminary efficacy findings indicate improved mental wellbeing and physical activity among long haulers. Larger-scale RCTs are needed in the future to improve the robustness and applicability of findings.","2025","2025 Apr","Abhishek Aggarwal; Shan Qiao; Chih-Hsiang Yang; Slone Taylor; Cheuk Chi Tam; Xiaoming Li","Department of Health Promotion Education and Behavior, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, United States of America.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, United States of America.; Department of Health Promotion Education and Behavior, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, United States of America.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, United States of America.; Exercise Science Department, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, United States of America.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, United States of America.; Department of Health Promotion Education and Behavior, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, United States of America.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, United States of America.; Department of Health Promotion Education and Behavior, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, United States of America.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, United States of America."

The SNTB is designed to incorporate a behaviorally relevant Telehealth component that enhances consumer confidence in symptom discrimination, management of PCNS, and guides rehabilitation programs while allowing for continuous evaluation of intervention effectiveness.The study employs a longitudinal design, with telehealth and routine blood assessments conducted at three-month intervals, including at least two follow-ups post-recruitment. These assessments will involve Consumer-Reported Symptoms, Clinical History, Neuropsychological Data, and Timed Psychophysics, aimed at rapid screening of PCNS-related symptoms including 'brain fog"" and its affect on visually driven attention, cognition and visually driven motor behaviors. These assessments are intended to validate the characteristics of 'brain fog' and identify predictive behavioral biomarkers for the development of PCNS.The target population includes adults aged 18-65 who have experienced persistent neurological symptoms for at least three months following a confirmed COVID-19 infection. Exclusion criteria include individuals unable to undergo radiological examinations, such as pregnant women or those with contraindications to MRI, ensuring the robustness of the sample and reducing potential selection bias.The SNTB tool will facilitate the online identification of predictive biomarkers for PCNS and aid in the discovery of effective molecular biomarker combinations for medical intervention and rehabilitation.

Data regarding age, sex, comorbidities, pre-admission therapy, and laboratory results were collected. Finally, the study included 181 hospitalized individuals (mean age 56.02 ± 13.02 years; 37.02% women).

Based upon i) patient and family reports that stressful life events trigger or exacerbate symptoms, ii) biologically plausible pathways whereby psychological states and stress hormones influence mitochondrial energy transformation capacity, and iii) epidemiological literature linking traumatic/stressful life events and multiple neurologic disorders, we hypothesized that mitochondrial disease symptom severity may in part vary with daily mood. To examine patients' perception around potential psycho-biological mechanisms known to operate in other chronic illnesses, we administered the Stress, Health and Emotion Survey (SHES) to 70 adults with self-reported mitochondrial diseases. Participants rated how severe each of their symptom(s) was over the past year, separately for either 'good' (happy, calm) or 'bad' (stress, sad) emotional days. On average, patients reported that most symptoms were better on ""good"" emotional days (p < 0.0001) and worse on ""bad"" emotional days (p < 0.0001). Of the 29 symptoms assessed, 27 were associated with daily mood (p < 0.01). Some but not all symptoms were reported to be less or more severe on good and bad days, respectively, including fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, and fine motor coordination (ps < 0.0001). These associative results suggest that on average individuals living with mitochondrial diseases perceive a connection between their mood and symptoms severity. These preliminary findings constitute an initial step towards developing more comprehensive models to understand the psychobiological factors that influence the course of mitochondrial diseases.","2025","2025 Mar 29","Catherine Kelly; Marissa Cross; Alex Junker; Kris Englestad; Xiomara Q Rosales; Michio Hirano; Caroline Trumpff; Martin Picard","Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.; Department of Neurology, H.

In the original case report, a 34-year-old female patient was administered approximately 15 sessions of Z-score neurofeedback. Pretest and post-test neurofeedback training qEEG reported significant declines in high-beta activity, i.e., beta, Hi beta, beta 1, and beta 3, and notable increases in alpha and theta brainwaves. These improvements were most evident at electrode sites C4, F3, and P3. The patient reported improved attention and memory, reduced anxiety, and less pain, although depression reduction was less. These results suggest that a relatively short program of neurofeedback can assist in shifting the brain from hyperarousal to a calmer, more efficient state.

Increased tinnitus, and decreased hearing in noise ability also occur with PASC, yet whether auditory manifestations of PASC are linked with the cognitive symptoms is not known. Electrophysiology, specifically the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), provides objective measures of auditory processing. We hypothesized that ABR findings would be linked to PASC and with subjective feelings of cognitive fatigue. Eighty-two individuals, 37 with PASC (mean age: 47.5, Female: 83%) and 45 healthy controls (mean age: 38.5, Female: 76%), were studied with an auditory test battery that included audiometry and ABR measures. Peripheral hearing thresholds did not differ between groups. The PASC group had a higher prevalence of tinnitus, anxiety, depression, and hearing handicap in addition to increased subjective cognitive fatigue. ABR latency findings showed a significantly greater increase in the wave V latency for PASC subjects when a fast (61.1 clicks/sec) compared to a slow click (21.1 clicks/sec) was used. The increase in latency correlated with cognitive fatigue scores and predicted PASC status. The ABR V/I amplitude ratio was examined as a measure of central gain. Although these ratios were not significantly elevated in the full PASC group, to minimize the cofounding effect of age, the cohort was median split on age. Elevated V/I amplitude ratios were significant predictors of both predicted PASC group classification and cognitive fatigue scores in the younger PASC subjects compared to age-matched controls providing evidence of elevated central gain in younger individuals with PASC. More frequent tinnitus also significantly predicted higher subjective cognitive fatigue scores. Our findings suggest that PASC may alter the central auditory pathway and lead to slower conduction and elevated auditory neurophysiology responses at the midbrain, a pattern associated with the typical aging process. This study marks a significant stride toward establishing an objective measure of subjective cognitive fatigue through assessment of the central auditory system.","2025","2025 Mar 18","Christopher Niemczak; Erika Skoe; Samantha Leigh; Linda Zhang; Megan Dotzenrod; Annalise Kieley; Simon Stone; Jeffrey Parsonnet; Christina Martin; Christin Ealer; Odile Clavier; Jiang Gui; Angela Waszkiewicz; Robert Roth; Jay Buckey","Department of Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, USA.

We determined burdens, incidence, evolution, and associated factors of long COVID-19 over two years among these groups. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and recruited confirmed COVID-19 survivors from December 2020 to May 2021 (previously reported). 346 survivors underwent in-person follow-ups at five, nine, 18 months and two years post-infection. The assessment included long COVID symptoms, cardiorespiratory function, neuropsychiatric conditions, quality of life, and laboratory tests. The outcomes included one or more symptoms and/or signs indicative of long COVID, aligning closely with the World Health Organization definition of post-COVID-19 condition. Of the 346 participants, we included 326 in the analysis. 78% of HS (n/N = 171/219) and 62% of NHS (n/N = 55/89) reported at least one sequela symptom. HS had higher odds of palpitations, headaches, dizziness, sleeping difficulties, brain fog, muscle weakness, joint pain, hypertension, insulin requirement, poor quality of life, and prolonged corrected QT intervals on electrocardiogram compared to NHS at two years (95% confidence interval (CI)>1). Regarding evolution, sequelae-symptoms, neurological outcomes, restrictive spirometry findings, and electrocardiogram abnormalities remained unchanged, although psychiatric sequelae, quality of life, and exercise capacity improved in both groups. Hospital readmission rates significantly increased (P < 0.05). The incidence rates of palpitations, cough, and hypertension were higher in HS compared to NHS (95% CI>1). Two or more vaccine doses decreased the risk of respiratory (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.63-0.91) and psychiatric sequelae (aRR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.66-0.92) than one or no doses. COVID-19 survivors, particularly HS, experienced a higher burden of persistent symptoms and health issues two years after infection. However, vaccination significantly reduced the risk of respiratory and psychiatric outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of ongoing vaccination programs and the need for targeted rehabilitation services in low-resource settings.","2025","2025 Mar 14","Farzana Afroze; Shohael Mahmud Arafat; Chowdhury Meshkat Ahmed; Baharul Alam; Sayera Banu; Md Zahidul Islam; Mustafa Mahfuz; Firdausi Qadri; Taufiqur Rahman Bhuiyan; Irin Parvin; Mst Mahmuda Ackhter; Farhana Islam; Monjeline Sultana; Eva Sultana; Mohammad Ferdous Ur Rahaman; Abed Hussain Khan; Md Nazmul Hasan; Shahriar Ahmed; Mohammod Jobayer Chisti; Tahmeed Ahmed","Nutrition Research Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Department of Internal Medicine, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Department of Cardiology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Nutrition Research Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Infectious Diseases Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Nutrition Research Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Nutrition Research Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Infectious Diseases Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Infectious Diseases Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Nutrition Research Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Nutrition Research Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Nutrition Research Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Nutrition Research Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Nutrition Research Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Department of Internal Medicine, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Department of Internal Medicine, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Department of Internal Medicine, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Infectious Diseases Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Nutrition Research Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Nutrition Research Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh."

We conducted an online survey to assess the health condition of convalescents approximately 5 months following the primary infection of SARS-CoV-2. The study recruited 5,510 individuals who were primary infected, 626 participants who had experienced reinfection, and 521 participants who were without infective history. The most common disorders after the primary infection group were fatigue (15.18 %), memory issue (13.13 %), post-exertional malaise (PEM, 11.68 %), and brain fog (11.29 %) at the time of survey. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection had an impact on the reproductive systems. In stepwise logistic regression analysis, smoking currently, with background diseases, and outpatient visits in the acute phase could be associated with moderate / severe disorders. Further analysis of different background diseases showed that allergic rhinitis, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, neurological diseases, and asthma likely increased the risk of moderate/severe disorders. The probability of developing disorders of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was higher before the secondary infection than uninfected people. Fatigue, PEM, muscle pain/spasms, chills, joint pain, excessive sweating at rest, headache / dizziness, sore throat or foreign body sensation in the throat, cough, expectoration, dry / painful / watery eyes, loss of appetite and constipation were associated with an increased risk of reinfection. It was essential to undertake further research with enhanced randomization in a larger sample in the community, and to strengthen the validation of the research conclusions. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the health recovery process among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescents. Moreover, the findings help identify characteristic health risk factors associated with convalescents and highlight the risk of moderate / severe disorders and reinfection. Furthermore, the findings also provide valuable guidance and reference for SARS-CoV-2 rehabilitation strategies and the prevention of reinfection, offering insights for scientific recommendations.","2024","2024 Aug","Yalan Wang; Maoshun Liu; Yuanyuan Guo; Min Li; Peipei Guo; Wenjun He; Tian Ma; Peipei Liu; Yaxin Guo; Beiwei Ye; Jun Liu; Guizhen Wu","NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing 102206, China.; NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing 102206, China.; College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China.; NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing 102206, China.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Shandong 250100, China.; NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing 102206, China.; NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing 102206, China.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Shandong 250100, China.; NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing 102206, China.; School of Public Health and Management, Shandong First Medical University &Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250117, China.; NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing 102206, China.; School of Public Health and Management, Shandong First Medical University &Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250117, China.; NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing 102206, China.; NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing 102206, China.; NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing 102206, China.; NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing 102206, China.; NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing 102206, China."

As iron deficiency is particularly common in women of reproductive age, often due to heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), we aimed to explore the relationship between iron deficiency, HMB and ADHD in women. We screened women (18-49 years) at university and local sporting events in Western Australia. To screen for ADHD, section A of the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-V1.1 (ASRS-V1.1) and the Adult Concentration Inventory were used to assess cognitive disengagement syndrome (CDS) symptoms. Risk factors for iron deficiency, such as HMB, commonly reported symptoms and a fingerpick haemoglobin concentration (Hb) (Hemocue Hb801) were recorded. Of the 405 completed questionnaires, the mean age was 24.8 ± 10.1 years, the mean Hb was 136.8 ± 12.4 g/L and 6.4% of women were anaemic. Symptoms suggestive of ADHD were reported by 174/405 (43%) women, and 128/405 (32%) women reported HMB. There was a greater prevalence of HMB reported in those experiencing symptoms suggestive of ADHD (39% vs. 26%, p = 0.01). Symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, brain fog, anxiety, heart palpitations, headaches, restless legs and depression were more common in patients with symptoms suggestive of ADHD (p ? 0.01) and HMB (p < 0.05). Anaemia status did not influence ADHD status (p = 0.87) nor CDS scores (15.7 ± 7.0 vs. 13.8 ± 6.1, p = 0.17).

The need to better understand these potential relationships in women for whom monthly blood loss (and thus iron loss) is ceasing is highlighted by iron's accumulation in brain tissue over time, thought to be a factor in the development of neurodegenerative disease. Non-anemic women who were either low in iron or had normal iron levels for their age and race/ethnicity provided blood samples, underwent MRI scans to estimate brain iron levels, and performed a set of cognitive tasks with concurrent EEG. Cognitive performance and brain dynamics were positively related to iron levels, including measures associated with oxygen transport. There were no relationships between any of the blood measures of iron and brain iron. Higher iron status was associated with better cognitive performance in a sample of women who were neither iron deficient nor anemic, without there being any indication that higher levels of systemic iron were related to higher levels of brain iron. Consequently, addressing low iron levels at the menopausal transition may be a candidate approach for alleviating the ""brain fog"" commonly experienced at menopause.","2025","2025 Feb 20","Amy L Barnett; Michael J Wenger; Pamela Miles; Dee Wu; Zitha Redempta Isingizwe; Doris M Benbrook; Han Yuan","Psychology and Cellular and Behavioral Neurobiology, The University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, USA.; Psychology and Cellular and Behavioral Neurobiology, The University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, USA.; Obstetrics and Gynecology, College of Medicine, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA.; Radiological Sciences, College of Medicine, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA.; Gynecological Oncology, College of Medicine, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA.; Gynecological Oncology, College of Medicine, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA.; Stephenson School of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, USA."

Despite widespread administration, their long-term systemic effects on human metabolism remain inadequately understood. This longitudinal study aims to evaluate IgG responses, 34 cytokines, 112 lipoproteins, and 21 low-molecular-weight metabolites in 33 individuals receiving two to four COVID-19 vaccine doses. Changes in metabolic profiles for the first 16 days post each dose of vaccine, and up to 480 days post-initial dose, were compared to baseline (before vaccination). Additionally, metabolic profiles of vaccinated participants were compared to a reference cohort of unvaccinated individuals without prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection (controls) and SARS-CoV-2 cases. Positive IgG responses were observed in 78.8% (N = 26) of participants after the first dose, reaching 100% with subsequent doses. The most common side effects were localized pain at the injection site and ""flu-like"" symptoms, reported by > 50% of participants. Systemic side effects, e.g., sore lymph nodes, fatigue, and brain fog, were reported but showed no significant correlations to IgG responses. Transient temporal changes were observed for cytokine IP10 (CXCL10) and glutamic acid around the third vaccine dose. Compared to the reference cohort, 497 vaccinated samples (95.0%) had profiles similar to the controls, while the remaining 26 samples with prior infection exposures were similar to mild cases of SARS-CooV-2 infection. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination did not induce lasting changes in inflammatory and metabolic responses, nor did it induce changes similar to mild cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This supports the metabolic safety of the vaccine and contributes to increased vaccine confidence. KEY MESSAGES: Minimal changes in inflammatory/metabolic markers up to 480 days post-vaccination. Transient increase in IP10 (CXCL10) and glutamic acid around the third dose. Post-vaccination IgG response did not alter metabolic profiles like SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Participants from the WHI who completed the COVID-19 survey (2021-2022) and annual survey (2022) were included. Self-reported data on COVID-19 testing and symptoms (2021-2022) were used. PF score and ADLs were evaluated pre- and post-COVID-19 survey by the 36-Item Short Form Survey PF subscale, the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, and the Katz Index of Independence in ADL. Multivariable linear regression and logistic regression were used and adjusted for pre-COVID functioning to examine the association between COVID status, PF, and ADLs. The interaction between pre-COVID functioning and COVID status was tested. Among the 13,933 WHI participants, 71.4% were aged ≥ 80 years, and 88.6% were Non-Hispanic White. Only 8.7% tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 1210), with 35.1% having long COVID (n = 425). The most common long COVID symptoms were fatigue (18.2%), malaise (12.2%), memory problems (12.1%), and brain fog (11.2%).

Many factors have been implicated in these complications, including glymphatic system disorders, small vessel disease, and widespread inflammation. Peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) is a sensitive biomarker for SVD, while the diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) measures glymphatic system function. This study aims to investigate changes in PSMD and DTI-ALPS parameters in COVID-19 patients. Clinical and MRI data were obtained from the ""neuroCOVID MRI dWI and fMRI with reversal learning"" dataset, comprising 88 participants aged 19-65 years. Participants included 72 COVID-19-positive patients (30 hospitalized and 42 non-hospitalized) and 16 COVID-19-negative controls. None had neurological symptoms aside from anosmia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using validated scales: depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and anxiety symptoms with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7). Cognitive functioning was evaluated using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-III), while executive functioning was measured with the Ineco Frontal Screening (IFS-Ch). Functional capacity was assessed using the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT). MRI scans were processed to calculate PSMD and DTI-ALPS values. Statistical analyses compared hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients with controls using the Mann-Whitney U test and partial correlation analysis. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed a significant increase in PSMD index values compared to controls indicating SVD. Non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients did not differ significantly from controls in PSMD values. No significant differences were found in DTI-ALPS values between any COVID-19 groups and controls. Additionally, there were no significant correlations between neurocognitive test scores and PSMD or DTI-ALPS values. Severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization are associated with increased PSMD index values, suggesting the presence of small vessel disease even in the absence of overt neurological symptoms. Mild COVID-19 cases managed outpatiently do not exhibit significant SVD or glymphatic dysfunction.","2025","2025 Mar 07","Barış Genç; Mehmet Seyfi Buruk; Ali Özçağlayan; Aslan Kerim","Ondokuz Mayis University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Neuroradiology, Samsun, Turkey (B.G., A.K.).

Achieving remission offers substantial benefits, including improved hrQoL and reduced mortality, yet the complexity of SLE, with its diverse underlying immune mechanisms and clinical manifestations, hampers progress. Involvement of the central nervous system with symptoms like fatigue, pain and brain fog often goes unaddressed due to limited evidence-based guidance and measurement tools. This neglect reflects gaps in training, discomfort in addressing untreatable symptoms and an overemphasis on evidence-based medicine, compromising holistic care.

Current research highlights the critical role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in regulating gut microbiota diversity, vascular function, and homeostasis within the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 is utilized by the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter host cells, but its downregulation following infection contributes to gut microbiota dysbiosis and RAS disruption. These imbalances have been linked to a range of long COVID symptoms, including joint pain, chest pain, chronic cough, fatigue, brain fog, anxiety, depression, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, memory difficulties, and impaired attention. This review investigates the dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and the long-term effects it has on various organ systems, including the musculoskeletal, neurological, renal, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. We explored the bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota, immune function, and these organ systems, focusing on how microbiota dysregulation contributes to the chronic inflammation and dysfunction observed in long COVID symptoms. Understanding these interactions is key for identifying effective therapeutic strategies and interventional targets aimed at mitigating the impact of long COVID on organ health and improving patient outcomes.","2025","2025","Angelie Pathak; Devendra K Agrawal","Department of Translational Research, College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, California 91766 USA.; Department of Translational Research, College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, California 91766 USA."

Using data from the Aerobic exercise and CogniTIVe functioning in women with breAsT cancEr (ACTIVATE) trial, we conducted exploratory analyses to compare self-reported and objective measures of cognition and applied microstate analysis to resting state (RS) electroencephalography (EEG) data of women with breast cancer before and following chemotherapy treatment. Data from eight female participants between the ages of 30 and 52 (mean age = 44.8 years, SD = 7.3 years) were analyzed. Cognitive function was assessed using the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) and the Trail Making Test (TMT). Five minutes of RS eyes-closed EEG data were also collected. Seven EEG microstates were extracted, and mean microstate duration and occurrence were computed. Following chemotherapy, there was a significant decrease in the PROMIS score (p = 0.003, d = 1.601), but no significant difference in the TMT score. Overall, microstate durations were significantly longer (p < 0.001, d = 2.837) and less evenly distributed following chemotherapy. The mean duration of microstate D (involved in attention/executive functions) significantly increased following chemotherapy (p = 0.007, d = 1.339). Comparing behavioral and microstate measures that exhibited a large effect size, no significant correlations were observed either before or after chemotherapy. We observed self-reported cognitive impairment and disturbed functional dynamics in the RS brain following chemotherapy.

However, there is uncertainty about the relationship between PCC and work outcomes. This study aimed to assess health-related adverse work outcomes in individuals with a PCC history compared with others who had COVID-19. This was a cross-sectional study in which participants in British Columbia (BC) completed an online questionnaire. Participants comprised adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR at least 2 years before questionnaire completion and were working age (18-64) at the time of infection. PCC status was determined by self-report. The health-related adverse work outcomes evaluated included change in occupation or employer, reduced workload, increased sick days compared with before COVID-19, early retirement and indefinite sick leave. Analyses were weighted to reflect the characteristics of individuals who had COVID-19 in BC. Propensity score overlap weighting was used to adjust for relevant sociodemographic and clinical covariates. Among 1106 participants, 966 (87.3%) were employed when they contracted SARS-CoV-2 and included in analyses. Of these participants, 47.8% were female, the median age was 37 and 46.9% had a PCC history. Compared with other individuals who had COVID-19, those with a PCC history were more likely to have had a health-related adverse work outcome (46.5% vs 24.9%; adjusted OR (aOR) 2.6 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.0)) and reported a greater number of sick days in the first 2 years since contracting SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted mean difference 43 days (95% CI 20 to 65)). The risk of a health-related adverse work outcome was especially high in those with post-COVID-19 fatigue (aOR 4.6 (95% CI 2.7 to 7.9)), fever (aOR 4.0 (95% CI 1.7 to 9.6)), weakness (aOR 3.8 (95% CI 2.2 to 6.3)), palpitations (aOR 3.3 (95% CI 2.0 to 5.0)) and brain fog (aOR 3.2 (95% CI 2.0 to 5.0)).

This study explores potential triggers such as sleep quality, mood, and gastrointestinal health and examines the link between adherence to the MIND diet and brain fog severity. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between 1 July and 15 December 2022. The questionnaire assessed brain fog symptoms, dietary habits, sleep quality, mood, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Linear regression analysis examined the relationships between brain fog symptoms, demographic factors, sleep quality, MIND diet adherence, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Results: Brain Fog Scale (BFS) scores were significantly higher in individuals who had COVID-19 (p < 0.05) and even higher in those with reinfection. Women had higher BFS and Brain Fog Severity Score (BFSS), MIND Diet, The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), Brief Mood Introspection Scale (BMIS) Pleasant-Unpleasant scores (p < 0.05). BFS and BFSS were positively correlated with GSRS (p < 0.05), while no correlation was found with MIND diet adherence. A negative correlation was observed between BFS and Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) (p < 0.05), but this was not significant in regression (p = 0.367). GSRS, Pleasant-Unpleasant Dimension, and Arousal-Calm Dimension were significant predictors of BFS (R = 0.599, R2 = 0.358, p < 0.01). Conclusions: This study identifies being female as a risk factor for brain fog symptoms, with women reporting higher BFS and BFSS scores. While sleep quality showed a negative correlation with brain fog symptoms, this relationship was not significant in the regression model, suggesting that other factors, such as mood and gastrointestinal symptoms, may play a more dominant role. However, adherence to the MIND diet showed no significant relationship with brain fog symptoms. These findings suggest that addressing mood and gastrointestinal health may be key to managing brain fog in long COVID.","2025","2025 Feb 15","Canan Altinsoy; Derya Dikmen","Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hacettepe University, 06230 Ankara, Turkey.; Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Recep Tayyip Erdogan University, 53020 Rize, Turkey.; Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hacettepe University, 06230 Ankara, Turkey."

Subsequent validation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in an expanded cohort-consisting of PASC patients, non-PASC COVID-19 convalescents, and pre-pandemic healthy controls-revealed two promising biomarkers: autoantibodies targeting PITX2 and FBXO2. PITX2 autoantibodies demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing PASC patients from both non-PASC convalescents (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.891) and healthy controls (AUC = 0.866), while FBXO2 autoantibodies showed moderate accuracy (AUC = 0.762 and 0.786, respectively). Notably, the levels of these autoantibodies were associated with several PASC symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, palpitations, loss of appetite, and brain fog. The identification of PITX2 and FBXO2 autoantibodies as biomarkers not only enhances our understanding of PASC pathophysiology but also provides promising candidates for further investigation.","2025","2025 Feb 19","Yasuyoshi Hatayama; Kei Miyakawa; Yayoi Kimura; Kazuo Horikawa; Kouichi Hirahata; Hirokazu Kimura; Hideaki Kato; Atsushi Goto; Akihide Ryo","Department of Virology III, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama 208-0011, Japan.; Department of Microbiology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.; Department of Microbiology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.; Research Center for Influenza and Respiratory Viruses, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama 208-0011, Japan.; Advanced Medical Research Center, Yokohama City University, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.; Advanced Medical Research Center, Yokohama City University, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.; Hirahata Clinic, Tokyo 150-0002, Japan.; Department of Health Science, Gunma Paz University Graduate School of Health Sciences, Takasaki 370-0006, Japan.; Infection Prevention and Control Department, Yokohama City University Hospital, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.; Department of Public Health, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.; Department of Virology III, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama 208-0011, Japan.; Department of Microbiology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan."

We report on surgical findings and impressive findings with low-flow CSF leakage in the context of an arachnoidal bleb. We report a 42-year-old Neuroscientist with a 23-month history of positional headaches after a lumbar puncture (LP). Multiple Sclerosis was ruled out, but chronic orthostatic headache and tinnitus developed. Bed rest, caffeine tablets, IV hydration, and five high-volume epidural blood patches did not lead to improvement. However, brain fog and reduced ability to work ensued. A dynamic myelography did not reveal a CSF leak or a CSF-venous fistula, but a high-resolution T2Space Fat-saturated MRI detected an arachnoidal bleb at the alleged L3-L4 level. Microsurgical exploration identified the arachnoid bleb as a low-flow CSF leak.

To describe clinical, epidemiological and evolutionary aspects of a cohort of patients diagnosed with PCS followed on an outpatient basis. Individuals of both sexes, > 18-years old who presented symptoms suggestive of PCS and had previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Clinical evaluation was carried out monthly by a multidisciplinary team, and if necessary laboratorial exams were performed. From June 2021 to June 2022, 92 cases of PCS were diagnosed, of which 60 (65.2 %) were female and the average age was 49.1 years. In 61 (66.3 %) of the cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred between January and November 2021. In 55 (59.7 %) of the cases the symptoms were mild, while 31 (36.0 %) were moderate or severe cases. Most cases of PCS occurred in individuals with the mild form of COVID-19. The predominant symptoms were chronic fatigue in 59 (68.6 %) cases, brain fog in 68 (73.4 %), myalgias and arthralgias in 44 (47.8 %), cramps and paresthesia's in 40 (46.5 %). The main comorbidities observed were high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes mellitus. The persistence of symptoms was greater in those cases who presented severe forms of COVID-19. Most patients experienced gradual and progressive improvement over the months. The profile of patients with PCS in this cohort is similar to other reports. A great number of symptoms is remarkable with variable presentation and evolution and their frequency exceeds that previously described in a large meta-analysis. Inflammatory phenomena mediated by the virus, autoimmunity and direct organic damage have been implicated in the genesis of this syndrome.","2025","2025 Mar-Apr","João Paulo Borges de Melo; Alex Eduardo da Silva; Leandro Resende Yamamoto; Taciana Fernandes Araújo Ferreira; Gustavo José Luvizutto; Fernando Freitas Neves; Kelly Cristina Santos; Roger Lopes Batista; Isabel Cunha Santos; Francielle Schiavoni; Mario León Silva-Vergara","Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro, Departamento de Medicina Interna, Departamento de Fisioterapia, Uberaba, MG, Brazil.; Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro, Departamento de Medicina Interna, Departamento de Fisioterapia, Uberaba, MG, Brazil.; Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro, Departamento de Medicina Interna, Departamento de Fisioterapia, Uberaba, MG, Brazil.; Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro, Departamento de Medicina Interna, Departamento de Fisioterapia, Uberaba, MG, Brazil.; Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro, Departamento de Medicina Interna, Departamento de Fisioterapia, Uberaba, MG, Brazil.; Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro, Departamento de Medicina Interna, Departamento de Fisioterapia, Uberaba, MG, Brazil.; Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro, Departamento de Medicina Interna, Departamento de Fisioterapia, Uberaba, MG, Brazil.; Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro, Departamento de Medicina Interna, Departamento de Fisioterapia, Uberaba, MG, Brazil.; Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro, Departamento de Medicina Interna, Departamento de Fisioterapia, Uberaba, MG, Brazil.; Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro, Departamento de Medicina Interna, Departamento de Fisioterapia, Uberaba, MG, Brazil.; Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro, Departamento de Medicina Interna, Departamento de Fisioterapia, Uberaba, MG, Brazil.

The need to better to understand these potential relationships in women for whom monthly blood loss (and thus iron loss) is ceasing is highlighted by the fact that iron accumulates in brain tissue over time and that accumulation is thought to be a factor in the development of neurodegenerative disease. Non-anemic women who were either low in iron or had normal iron levels for their age and race/ethnicity provided blood samples, underwent MRI scans to estimate brain iron levels, and performed a set of cognitive tasks with concurrent EEG. Results: Cognitive performance as well as brain dynamics were positively related to iron levels, including measures associated with oxygen transport. There were no relationships between any of the blood measures of iron and brain iron. Higher iron status was associated with better cognitive performance in a sample of women who were neither iron deficient nor anemic, without there being any indication that higher levels of systemic iron were related to higher levels of brain. Consequently, addressing low iron levels at the menopausal transition may be a candidate approach for alleviating the ""brain fog"" commonly experienced at menopause.","2025","2025 Jan 29","Amy L Barnett; Michael J Wenger; Pamela Miles; Dee Wu; Zitha Redempta Isingizwe; Doris M Benbrook; Han Yuan",""

Intravenous Laser Irradiation of Blood (ILIB) has been proposed as a potential intervention. This pilot study explores the efficacy of ILIB in alleviating brain fog symptoms and examines the underlying molecular mechanisms. To evaluate the effectiveness of ILIB in improving cognitive function in long COVID patients with brain fog and to investigate the molecular pathways involved. A prospective, single-center pilot study involving six long COVID patients with brain fog who underwent ILIB therapy. Patients received 30 ILIB sessions over eight weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) at baseline, post-treatment, and one-month follow-up. RNA sequencing and pathway enrichment analyses (KEGG, Gene Ontology) identified differentially expressed genes and molecular pathways influenced by ILIB. MoCA and AIS scores significantly improved post-ILIB, suggesting enhanced cognitive function and sleep quality. RNA sequencing revealed 141 upregulated and 130 downregulated genes. Upregulated pathways were associated with mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, while immune response and inflammatory pathways were downregulated. Notably, the glutathione metabolism pathway was significantly altered, suggesting reduced oxidative stress. ILIB shows potential in alleviating brain fog symptoms in long COVID patients, possibly through modulation of oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and inflammation. However, larger randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and establish ILIB as a viable therapeutic option.","2025","2025 Feb 17","Cheng-Chiang Chang; Yu-He Li; Shin-Tsu Chang; Hsin-Hung Chen","Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Tri-Service General Hospital, School of Medicine, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zuoying Armed Forces General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Tri-Service General Hospital, School of Medicine, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Education and Research, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, 813414, Taiwan."

One of the leading symptoms of long-COVID is cognitive impairment, which includes memory loss, lack of concentration, and brain fog. Understanding the nature and underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairment in long-COVID is important for developing preventive and therapeutic interventions. Our present study investigated functional connectivity (FC) changes in patients with long-COVID and their associations with cognitive impairment. Resting-state functional MRI data from 60 long-COVID patients and 52 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were analyzed using seed-based functional connectivity analysis. We found increased FC between the right caudate nucleus and both the left and right precentral gyri in long-COVID patients compared with healthy controls. In addition, elevated FC was observed between the right anterior globus pallidus and posterior cingulate cortex as well as the right temporal pole in long-COVID patients. Importantly, the magnitude of FC between the caudate and the left precentral gyrus showed a significant negative correlation with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and a negative correlation with Trail Making Test B performance in the patient group. Patients with long-COVID present enhanced FC between the caudate and the left precentral gyrus. Furthermore, those FC alterations are related to the severity of cognitive impairment, particularly in the domain of executive functions.","2025","2025 Feb 17","Marie Troll; Meng Li; Tara Chand; Marlene Machnik; Tonia Rocktäschel; Antonia Toepffer; Johanna Ballez; Kathrin Finke; Daniel Güllmar; Jürgen R Reichenbach; Martin Walter; Bianca Besteher","Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Jena, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Jena, Germany.; German Center for Mental Health (DZPG).; Center for Intervention and Research on Adaptive and Maladaptive Brain Circuits Underlying Mental Health (C-I-R-C), Halle-Jena-Magdeburg.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Jena, Germany.; Department of Clinical Psychology, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Germany.; Jindal Institute of Behavioral Sciences, O.

While LC is considered multifactorial in its pathogenesis, growing evidence suggests that persistent microvascular inflammation (ie, spike-induced endotheliosis) causing chronically elevated levels of clotting factors including von Willebrand factor (vWF), clumping/clotting of red blood cells and platelets, and thrombotic complications may be at the root of PASC/LC symptoms. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of glutathione, is an inexpensive FDA-approved drug/supplement endowed with mucolytic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and thrombolytic properties. Multiple reports have recently demonstrated the potential clinical activity of NAC in COVID-19 patients. We retrospectively evaluated responses to NAC supplementation in a total of 9 PASC/LC patients, 3 of which reporting regular use of NAC, followed in our Gynecologic Oncology clinic. Gynecologic patients using NAC supplement (3 patients) vs controls (6 patients) with persistent LC/PASC symptoms and with elevated plasmatic vWF levels were identified in our Gynecologic Oncology clinic database and evaluated for improvement/normalization in LC/PASC symptoms and vWF levels. Subjective improvement in shortness of breath, brain fog and fatigue with normalization of vWF levels were noted in 3 out of 3 PASC/LC patients using oral NAC (600-1200 mg BID) vs none of the randomly selected cancer control patients with PASC/LC (Fisher's exact P = 0.0119).

The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in long COVID. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients who visited the COVID-19 aftercare outpatient clinic at Okayama University Hospital from February 2021 to April 2024. Results: A total of 428 patients were enrolled in this study, and the patients were divided into a group with normal BNP (n = 314, ≤18.4 pg/mL) and a group with increased BNP (n = 114, >18.4 pg/mL). The long COVID group with increased BNP had a higher proportion of females (44.3% vs. 73.7%, p < 0.01) and an older median age (38 vs. 51 years, p < 0.01). Fatigue and brain fog were commonly manifested in both groups, while dyspnea was a more frequent complaint in the group with increased BNP. Various symptoms including fatigue, palpitations, and taste and/or olfactory disorders were associated with elevated BNP (23 to 24 pg/mL). Memory impairment was also linked to higher BNP (OR: 2.36, p = 0.05). In long COVID patients, plasma BNP elevation appears to be more pronounced in females and is often related to cardiogenic factors, in which inflammatory responses are also involved. Conclusions: Plasma BNP measurement may be useful for evaluating the severity of long COVID, especially in female patients and those with respiratory symptoms and/or memory impairment.","2025","2025 Jan 26","Yohei Masuda; Yuki Otsuka; Kazuki Tokumasu; Hiroyuki Honda; Yasue Sakurada; Yui Matsuda; Yasuhiro Nakano; Ryosuke Takase; Daisuke Omura; Toru Hasegawa; Keigo Ueda; Fumio Otsuka","Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, Japan."

Published literature on idiopathic hypersomnia sleep abnormalities, symptoms, treatments, and underlying pathophysiology was reviewed. Patients with idiopathic hypersomnia often show sleep architecture alterations, such as increased sleep efficiency and reduced slow-wave sleep, although the literature lacks consensus. The current understanding of pathophysiologic changes in idiopathic hypersomnia is sparse, but several hypotheses have been posited to explain specific symptoms. Long biological sleep clock, hypofunction of default mode network, dysregulated gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling, inflammation, reduced physical activity, and immunologic abnormalities have been linked, to varying degrees, with the hallmark symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia (excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep inertia, brain fog, dysautonomia). Treatment mechanisms may help elucidate pathophysiologic mechanisms. LXB effectively addresses idiopathic hypersomnia symptoms and is the only US-approved therapy for this indication. Oxybate, the active moiety in LXB, acts dose-dependently on GABA and gamma-hydroxybutyrate receptors, inhibits dopamine and noradrenaline signaling, and improves sleep architecture in people with narcolepsy. The effectiveness of LXB, a sleep-inducing treatment, on idiopathic hypersomnia symptoms suggests altered sleep architecture may contribute to this disorder. Idiopathic hypersomnia, a sleep disorder with potentially debilitating symptoms, remains understudied. The underlying pathophysiology of idiopathic hypersomnia needs defining; insights can be gleaned from contextualizing current knowledge about mechanisms of effective treatments, such as LXB.","2025","2025 Feb 06","Logan D Schneider; Alyssa Cairns; Chad Ruoff; Richard K Bogan","Stanford University Sleep Medicine Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Redwood City, CA.; BioSerenity, Columbia, SC.; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ.; University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, SC."

Our cohort included individuals with T2D from eight sites with longitudinal natural language processing (NLP) data. The primary outcome was death or new-onset recurrent Long COVID symptoms within 30-180 days after COVID-19. Symptoms were identified as keywords from clinical notes using NLP in respiratory, brain fog, fatigue, loss of smell/taste, cough, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal symptom categories. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the risk of Long COVID by HbA1c range, adjusting for demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, and diabetes medication.

We injected ≤185 MBq of [18F]-FEPPA as an intravenous bolus and positron-emission tomography over 2 h. To measure distribution volume (VT) we recruited 24 essential workers (14 N-PASC, 10 Never-COVID-19 Controls, of whom 22 successfully placed arterial lines). Individuals with low binding affinity were excluded from this study, and VT was adjusted for translocator protein genotype. Analyses that passed the false discovery rate are reported. Participants at midlife survived mild to moderate COVID-19 without hospitalization but reported onset of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) for, on average, 22 months before undergoing neuroimaging. Hippocampal VT was higher (VT = 1.70, 95% C.I. = [1.30-2.21], p = 0.001) in participants with persistent brain fog after COVID-19, reflecting an increase of 10.58 mL/cm3 in VT (area under the receiver-operating curve, AUC = 0.95 [0.85-1.00]). At a cutoff of 10.6, sensitivity/specificity/accuracy were 0.88/0.93/0.91. The results from this study imply that neuroimmune response is a distinct and identifiable characteristic of brain fog after COVID-19.

China provides an ideal study environment owing to its large infection base, high vaccine coverage, and stringent pre-pandemic measures. This retrospective study used an online questionnaire to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection status and long COVID symptoms among 74,075 Chinese residents over one year. The relationships between baseline characteristics, vaccination status, pathogenic infection, and long COVID were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression, and propensity matching. Analysis of 68,200 valid responses revealed that the most frequent long COVID symptoms include fatigue (30.53%), memory decline (27.93%), decreased exercise ability (18.29%), and brain fog (16.87%). These symptoms were less prevalent among those infected only once: fatigue (24.85%), memory decline (18.11%), and decreased exercise ability (12.52%), etc. Women were more likely to experience long COVID, with symptoms varying by age group, except for sleep disorders and muscle/joint pain, which were more common in older individuals. Northern China exhibits a higher prevalence of long COVID, potentially linked to temperature gradients. Risk factors included underlying diseases, alcohol consumption, smoking, and the severity of acute infection (OR > 1, FDR < 0.05). Reinfection was associated with milder symptoms but led to a higher incidence and severity of long COVID (OR > 1, FDR < 0.05). Vaccination, particularly multiple boosters, significantly reduced long-term symptoms by 30%-70% (OR < 1, FDR < 0.05). COVID-19 participants also self-reported more bacterial, influenza and mycoplasma infections, and 8%-10% of patients felt SARS-CoV-2-induced chronic diseases. This survey provides valuable insights into long COVID situation among Chinese residents, with 10%-30% (including repeated infection) reporting symptoms. Monitoring at-risk individuals based on identified risk factors is essential for public health efforts.

Used by over 2 million people globally, it notably reduces hospitalizations and intubations in COVID-19 patients. To explore whether NRICM101 could combat COVID-19 brain fog, we tested NRICM101 on hACE2 transgenic mice administered the S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2, aiming to mitigate S1-induced cognitive issues by measuring animal behaviors, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. The study revealed that S1 protein-administered mice displayed marked signs of brain fog, characterized by reduced learning, memory, and nesting abilities. However, NRICM101 treatment in these animals ameliorated all these cognitive functions. S1 protein administration in mice induced notable inflammation, leading to the death of neurons (NeuN+) and neural stem cells (DCX+) in hACE2 transgenic mice. This was accompanied by heightened microglia activation (IBA1+/CD68+), increased cytokine production (IL1β, IL6), induction of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET), inflammation (NLRP3, CD11b), and platelet (CD31, vWF) and complement (C3) activation, ultimately damaging neurovasculature and disrupting the blood-brain barrier (B.B.B.). Administration of NRICM101 effectively alleviated all these pathological changes. In conclusion, NRICM101 has the potential to prevent COVID-19-associated brain fog by bolstering neurovascular integrity and protecting neurons and neural stem cells. This is achieved by the inhibition of S1 protein-induced complement activation, which in turn leads to the prevention of damage to the neurovasculature and the subsequent death of neurons.","2025","2025 Jan","Cher-Chia Chang; Yea-Hwey Wang; Jiin-Cherng Yen; Chia-Ching Liaw; Keng-Chang Tsai; Wen-Chi Wei; Wen-Fei Chiou; Chun-Tang Chiou; Kuo-Tong Liou; Yuh-Chiang Shen; Yi-Chang Su","Institute of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei City, 112304, Taiwan.; National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Science, Taipei City, 112303, Taiwan.; Institute of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei City, 112304, Taiwan.; National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taipei City, 112026, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Natural Products, College of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, 807378, Taiwan.; National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taipei City, 112026, Taiwan.; Program in Medical Biotechnology, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei City, 110301, Taiwan.; National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taipei City, 112026, Taiwan.; National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taipei City, 112026, Taiwan.; National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taipei City, 112026, Taiwan.; National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taipei City, 112026, Taiwan.; Department of Medicine, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei City, 25245, Taiwan.; Department of Chinese Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City, 114202, Taiwan.; National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taipei City, 112026, Taiwan.; National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Science, Taipei City, 112303, Taiwan.; National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taipei City, 112026, Taiwan."

COVID-19 vaccines reduce the gravity of ensuing SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, whether vaccines also have an impact on PASC remain unknown. We investigated whether vaccination prior to infection alters the subsequent neurologic post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC). We studied prospectively the first consecutive 200 post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) and 1100 non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP) patients evaluated at our neuro-COVID-19 clinic between May 2020 and January 2023. Among PNP patients, 87% had a pre-vaccination infection and 13% had a breakthrough infection post-vaccination. Among the NNP patients, 70.7% had a pre-vaccination infection and 29.3% had a breakthrough infection. Both PNP and NNP breakthrough infection patients had more frequent pre-existing depression/anxiety than their respective pre-vaccination infection groups, and NNP breakthrough infection patients also had more frequent comorbidities of headache, lung and gastrointestinal diseases than the NNP pre-vaccination infection group. An average of 10 months after symptom onset, the three most common neurological symptoms for PNP patients were brain fog (86.5%), numbness/tingling (56.5%) and headache (56.5%). Of all Neuro-PASC symptoms, PNP breakthrough infection more frequently reported anosmia compared to PNP pre-vaccination infection patients (69.2 versus 37.9%; P = 0.005). For NNP patients, the three most common neurological symptoms were brain fog (83.9%), headache (70.9%) and dizziness (53.8%). NNP pre-vaccination infection reported anosmia (56.6 versus 39.1%; P < 0.0001) and dysgeusia (53.3 versus 37.3%; P < 0.0001) more frequently than breakthrough infection patients. NNP breakthrough infection more frequently reported dizziness compared to NNP pre-vaccination infection patients (61.5 versus 50.6%; P = 0.001). Both PNP and NNP patients had impaired quality-of-life in cognitive, fatigue, sleep, anxiety and depression domains with no differences between pre-vaccination infection and breakthrough infection groups. PNP patients performed worse on National Institutes of Health Toolbox tests of processing speed, attention, executive function and working memory than a US normative population whereas NNP patients had lower results in processing, speed, attention and working memory, without differences between pre-vaccination infection and breakthrough infection groups. These results indicate that vaccination prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection does not affect the neurologic manifestations of long COVID in either PNP or NNP patients. Minor differences in neurologic symptoms between pre-vaccination infection and breakthrough infection groups may be caused by SARS-CoV-2 strains evolution. Patients developing Neuro-PASC after breakthrough infection have a higher burden of comorbidities, highlighting different risk factors warranting targeted management.","2025","2025","Shreya Mukherjee; Tracey Singer; Aditi Venkatesh; Natasha A Choudhury; Gina S Perez Giraldo; Millenia Jimenez; Janet Miller; Melissa Lopez; Barbara A Hanson; Aasheeta P Bawa; Ayush Batra; Eric M Liotta; Igor J Koralnik","Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Northwestern Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Northwestern Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA."

This case report describes the clinical progression of a 92-year-old female who developed a persistent neuroinfection associated with SARS-CoV-2. The patient initially presented with progressive fatigue, catarrhal symptoms, and a fever (38.6 °C). Initial laboratory findings revealed hypoxemia (O2 saturation 79.8%), acidosis (pH 7.3), an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 14.8 mg/L, and a high D-dimer level (2.15 µg/mL). Nasopharyngeal (NP) antigen and RT-PCR tests confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and an NP swab also detected penicillin- and ampicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. She was admitted for conservative management, including oxygen supplementation, IV fluids, and prophylactic anticoagulation. Subsequently, she developed neurological symptoms-lethargy, discoordination, and impaired communication-without signs of meningism. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Ct = 29) on RT-PCR, while bacterial cultures remained negative. Treatment was intensified to include 10% mannitol, dexamethasone, and empiric ceftriaxone. Despite these interventions, the patient remained somnolent, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 10. Upon discharge, her GCS had improved to 14; however, she continued to experience lethargy and cognitive issues, commonly described as ""brain fog"". Inflammatory markers remained elevated (CRP 23 mg/L) and repeat RT-PCR of CSF confirmed a persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence (Ct = 31).

As a common symptom comprising the long COVID condition, persistent COVID-19-associated olfactory dysfunction (C19OD) may further impact the presentations of neuropsychiatric sequelae. Our study aims to characterize the longitudinal burden of depression, anxiety, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a population with C19OD. Individuals with perceived C19OD completed a psychophysical screening evaluation of their sense of smell using the comprehensive Sniffin' Sticks olfactory assessment. Only those with validated psychophysical OD were included in this prospective longitudinal study for baseline and one-year follow-up. Participants also completed PHQ-9, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and neuropsychiatric symptom questionnaires at each time point. Anxiety, depression, and neuropsychiatric symptom prevalence was calculated and compared between time points with Pearson's chi-squared, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Each neuropsychiatric symptom evaluated in this study was reported by 13-49% of longitudinal cohort participants at both baseline and follow-up, except for seizure (0% at baseline and follow-up) and word-finding difficulty (61-68% at baseline and follow-up). Word-finding and focus difficulties were the most commonly reported symptoms.

Although menopausal women report a variety of additional symptoms, it remains unclear which emerge prior to menopause, which occur in predictable clusters, how clusters change across the menopausal transition, or if distinct phenotypes are present within each life stage. We present an analysis of symptoms in premenopausal to menopausal women using the MenoLife app, which includes 4789 individuals (23% premenopausal, 29% perimenopausal, 48% menopausal) and 147,501 symptom logs (19% premenopausal, 39% perimenopausal, 42% menopausal). Clusters generated from logs of 45 different symptoms were assessed for similarities across methods: hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), K-Means clustering of principal components of symptom reports, and binomial network analysis. Participants were further evaluated based on menstrual cycle regularity or natural versus medically induced menopause. Menstrual cycle-associated symptoms (e.g., cramps, breast swelling), digestive, mood, and integumentary symptoms were characteristic of premenopause. Vasomotor symptoms, pain, mood, and cognitive symptoms were characteristic of menopause. Perimenopausal women exhibited both menstrual cycle-associated and vasomotor symptoms. Subpopulations across life stages presented with additional correlated mood and cognitive, integumentary, digestive, nervous, or sexual complaints. Symptoms also differed among women depending on the reported regularity of their menstrual cycles or the way in which they entered menopause. Notably, we identified a set of symptoms that were very common across life stages: fatigue, headache, anxiety, and brain fog. Finally, we identified a lack of predictive power of hot flashes for any symptom except night sweats. Together, premenopausal women exhibit menstrual cycle-associated symptoms and menopausal women reported vasomotor symptoms, while perimenopausal women report both. All report high rates of fatigue, headache, anxiety, and brain fog. Limiting focus of menopausal treatment to vasomotor symptoms, or to premenstrual syndrome in premenopausal women, neglects a large proportion of overall symptom burden. Future interventions targeting mood and cognition, digestion, and the integumentary system are needed across stages of female reproductive life.","2025","2025 Jan 03","Shravan G Aras; Azure D Grant; John P Konhilas","Center for Biomedical Informatics and Biostatistics, University of Arizona Health Sciences, Tucson, AZ, 85750, USA.; Opensci, LLC, Tucson, AZ, 85750, USA.; People Science Inc., Los Angeles, CA, 90291, USA.; Opensci, LLC, Tucson, AZ, 85750, USA. konhilas@arizona.edu.; Department of Physiology, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, AZ, 85750, USA. konhilas@arizona.edu."

PASC predominantly affects the cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and immune systems. Among these, the central nervous system (CNS) is significantly impacted, leading to a spectrum of symptoms, including fatigue, headaches, brain fog, cognitive impairment, anosmia, hypogeusia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy (neuro-PASC). However, the risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms responsible for neuro-PASC remain unclear. This review hypothesis discusses the leading hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in long COVID/PASC, focusing on neuro-PASC. We propose vascular dysfunction mediated by activation of astrocytes and pericytes followed by blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption as underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological manifestations. Additionally, we provide insights into the role of spike protein at the blood-brain interface. Finally, we explore the potential pathogenic mechanisms initiated by the interaction between the spike protein and cellular receptors at the brain endothelial and tissue levels.","2024","2024","Filipe Menezes; Julys da Fonseca Palmeira; Juliana Dos Santos Oliveira; Gustavo Adolfo Argañaraz; Carlos Roberto Jorge Soares; Otávio Toledo Nóbrega; Bergmann Morais Ribeiro; Enrique Roberto Argañaraz","Biotechnology Center, Instituto de Pesquisas Energéticas e Nucleares, IPEN-CNEN/SP, São Paulo, Brazil.; Laboratory of Molecular Neurovirology, Faculty of Health Science, University of Brasília, Brasília, Brazil.; Laboratory of Molecular Neurovirology, Faculty of Health Science, University of Brasília, Brasília, Brazil.; Laboratory of Molecular Neurovirology, Faculty of Health Science, University of Brasília, Brasília, Brazil.; Biotechnology Center, Instituto de Pesquisas Energéticas e Nucleares, IPEN-CNEN/SP, São Paulo, Brazil.; Programa de Pós-graduação em Ciências Médicas da Faculdade de Medicina, University of Brasília, Brasília, Brazil.; Baculovirus Laboratory, Department of Cell Biology, University of Brasília, Brasília, Brazil.; Laboratory of Molecular Neurovirology, Faculty of Health Science, University of Brasília, Brasília, Brazil."

This study investigated the effects of idiopathic hypersomnia on social relationships (friends, romantic, and sexual) during the key developmental period of young adulthood. Young adults (N = 106; 18-39years) with idiopathic hypersomnia were recruited through national hypersomnia patient organizations. Participants completed an online survey assessing the impact of symptoms on overall social functioning, as well as assessing friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Nearly all participants (98%) reported that idiopathic hypersomnia made their social life more challenging. Over half (56%) felt they had too few close friends. While 69% were currently in a romantic relationship, the majority (92%) reported that idiopathic hypersomnia made it more challenging to enter a romantic relationship, with 89% stating that it impacted their sex life. Symptoms with the greatest perceived impact on social relationships were excessive sleepiness, brain fog, and long sleep. Most participants expressed that they would like their clinicians to ask about their social lives. Idiopathic hypersomnia substantially impacts the social lives of young adults, including friendships, romantic partnerships, and sex lives. Despite the importance of social relationships, clinicians seldom address this topic during clinic visits. When considering whole person health for people with idiopathic hypersomnia, clinical care would benefit from more attention to social health.","2025","2025 Feb","Ryan D Davidson; Margaret Blattner; Thomas E Scammell; Eric S Zhou","Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.

Diagnosis can be especially difficult in young women, where symptoms of porphyria often overlap with gynecological conditions. We present a case of a 37-year-old female patient who was experiencing persistent lower abdominal and pelvic pain, brain fog and confusion, and a rash after long sun exposure. Despite extensive evaluation from her gynecologist, including transvaginal ultrasound and pap smears, no abnormalities were found. Further evaluation performed by her primary care physician showed elevated porphyrin levels, suggesting a possible diagnosis of either hereditary coproporphyria or acute intermittent porphyria. After implementing a low-protein diet, the patient reported significant pain relief, which further supports a diagnosis of porphyria. This case highlights not only the challenges of diagnosing porphyria in young women but also the value of considering metabolic disorders in a preliminary differential diagnosis.

This study aimed to validate a brain fog scale and explore the relationships between IBD symptom activity, brain fog, fatigue, psychological distress, and quality of life (QoL). A cross-sectional online study. Of the 170 adults with IBD (mean age 38.75 years, 85.9% female, 62.35% Crohn's disease), 94.10% percent reported experiencing brain fog, with the majority (53.75%) experiencing brain fog at least 2 times a week, with each episode lasting around 2 hours. A confirmatory factor analysis supported the first hypothesis, demonstrating validity and stability of the brain fog scale in an IBD sample. Correlation analyses supported the second hypothesis, revealing positive relationships between IBD symptom activity and brain fog, fatigue and psychological distress, and a negative relationship between IBD symptom activity and QoL. A structural equation model with excellent fit (CMIN/df=1.84, p=0.137, TLI=0.98, CFI=0.99, SRMR=0.03, and RMSEA=0.07), provided support for the third hypothesis in that the relationship between IBD symptom activity and QoL was fully mediated by brain fog, fatigue, and psychological distress. This is the first study to explore the lived experience of brain fog and to validate the brain fog scale in an IBD sample. The study provides evidence that like fatigue, brain fog is not only common in IBD cohorts but is also frequent and adversely impacts psychological distress and QoL.","2024","2024 Dec 28","Simon R Knowles; Matthew Dickinson","Department of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Health, Arts and Design, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia. sknowles@swin.edu.au.; Department of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Health, Arts and Design, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia."

However, despite the high numbers of affected individuals presenting to clinical services with cognitive impairment, little work has been undertaken to date on the suitability of current memory clinic tests for identifying the cognitive deficits in this new acquired cognitive disorder.The aim of this study was therefore to determine the performance of people with post-Covid syndrome presenting with cognitive impairment on the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III), a cognitive test used widely in memory clinics. A subset of individuals also underwent testing on a novel battery of short digital tests assessing attention, speed of information processing and executive function, representing the domains primarily implicated in post-Covid cognitive dysfunction. 102 individuals with post-Covid syndrome presenting with subjective cognitive complaints were recruited from a specialist cognitive long Covid clinic at University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust. All participants completed self-report questionnaires on depression, anxiety, sleep and fatigue. Cognitive performance was assessed using the ACE-III, with 20 participants also being tested on the digital Long COVID Assessment Battery (LCCAB) (N = 20). The overall sample had a mean ACE-III score of 91/100 (SD 6) with 15.7% (16/102) scoring at or below the cut-off score considered to represent objective cognitive impairment. Of the 20 individuals who also completed the LCCAB, 89.47% were impaired on at least one task, primarily in the domains of attention, executive function and processing speed. Cognitive performance was not associated with depression, anxiety, sleep quality or fatigue. The vast majority of individuals with post-Covid syndrome presenting with subjective cognitive complaints do not exhibit impaired performance on the ACE-III. This likely reflects the historical use of ACE-III and other pen and paper cognitive tests to detect cognitive impairment in diseases causing dementia, but they are ill-equipped to identify impairment in those cognitive domains affected in post-Covid syndrome. The LCCAB detected cognitive impairments in nearly 90% of participants, primarily affecting attention, executive function, and processing speed. These observations highlight the need for alternative cognitive tests for use in routine clinical practice to detect the impairments in new acquired cognitive disorders that are not adequately captured by legacy tests.","2025","2025 Feb","Aysha Mohamed Rafik Patel; Gina Gilpin; Anna Koniotes; Catherine Warren; Cian Xu; Paul W Burgess; Dennis Chan","Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Neurology, University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust, United Kingdom.; Department of Neurology, University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust, United Kingdom.; Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Neurology, University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust, United Kingdom."

This calls for focused research on this population to better understand the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment post-COVID-19. Addressing gaps in the literature, the current study investigated differences in neuropsychological performance and cerebral haemodynamic activity following COVID-19 infection in undergraduate students. 94 undergraduates (age in years: M = 20.58, SD = 3.33, range = 18 to 46; 89 % female) at the University of Otago reported their COVID-19 infection history before completing a neuropsychological battery while wearing a multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device to record prefrontal haemodynamics. We observed that 40 % retrospectively self-reported cognitive impairment (brain fog) due to COVID-19 and 37 % exhibited objective evidence of cognitive impairment (assessed via computerised testing), with some suggestion that executive functioning may have been particularly affected; however, group-level analyses indicated preserved cognitive performance post COVID-19, which may in part reflect varying compensatory abilities. The NIRS data revealed novel evidence that previously infected students exhibited distinct prefrontal haemodynamic patterns during cognitive engagement, reminiscent of those observed in adults four decades older, and this appeared to be especially true if they reported experiencing brain fog due to COVID-19.

Due to the forward head-facedown lifestyle from excessive computer and cell phone usage, the posterior ligament complex of the cervical spine undergoes a slow stretch termed ""creep"" which can, over time, lead to cervical instability and a breakdown of the cervical curve. As this degenerative process continues, the cervical curve straightens and ultimately becomes kyphotic, a process called cervical dysstructure; simultaneously, the atlas (C1) moves forward, both of which can lead to encroachment of the structures in the carotid sheath, especially the internal jugular veins and vagus nerves. This obstruction of fluid flow can account for many brain diseases, and compression and stretch of the vagus nerve for body diseases, including dysautonomia. This article describes the consequences of impaired fluid flow into and out of the brain, especially venous flow through the internal jugular veins, leading to intracranial hypertension (formerly called pseudotumor cerebri). Cervical structural, internal jugular vein, and optic nerve sheath measurements are presented from a retrospective chart review of 227 consecutive patients with no obvious cause for 1 of 8 specific brain or mental health symptoms-anxiety, brain fog, concentration difficulty, depression/hopelessness, headaches, obsessive thoughts, panic attacks, and rumination on traumatic events. A case example is given to demonstrate how cervical structural treatments can open up internal jugular veins and improve a patient's chronic symptoms.","2024","2024","R A Hauser; D Matias; B Rawlings","Caring Medical Florida, Fort Myers, FL, United States.; Caring Medical Florida, Fort Myers, FL, United States.; Caring Medical Florida, Fort Myers, FL, United States."

Yet, consensus on clinical case definition and core components of PCC remains lacking, affecting our ability to inform research and evidence-based management. Our study aims 1) to identify the most specific symptoms for PCC, and identify clinical subtypes; 2) to evaluate both virus- and host-related determinants of PCC, and 3) assess the impact of PCC on physical and mental health. We studied participants from UK Biobank who completed a health and wellbeing survey between June and September 2022. Participants reported the current conditions of the presence, duration, and functional limitations of 45 symptoms, using an online questionnaire designed specifically for COVID-19 research. SARS-CoV-2 infection status and disease history were obtained through linkage to surveillance data and electronic medical records, respectively. Participants reporting symptoms within 30 days after infection (acute phase) were excluded. The most specific PCC symptoms were defined using two criteria: statistical significance (P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) and clinical relevance (absolute risk increase > 5%). Propensity score weighting was used to control for confounding. Subtypes of PCC were then defined based on the specific symptoms among the COVID-19 infected individuals. A multivariable regression was used to study pathogen- and host-related risk factors for PCC, and its impact on 13 physical and 4 mental health patient-reported functional outcomes. 172,303 participants (mean age 68.9, 57.4% female) were included in the analysis, of whom 43,395 had PCR-confirmed COVID-19. We identified 10 most specific symptoms and classified four PCC subtypes: ENT subtype (30.1%), characterized by alterations in smell, taste, and hearing loss; cardiopulmonary subtype (10.4%), characterized by shortness of breath, postural tachycardia, chest tightness, and chest pressure; neurological subtype (23.5%), characterized by brain fog and difficulty speaking; and general fatigue subtype (38.0%), characterized by mild fatigue. A higher PCC risk was observed for patients with Wild-type variant, multiple infections, and severe acute COVID-19 illness, consistently across the four PCC subtypes. In addition, a range of factors, including socioeconomic deprivation, higher BMI, unhealthy lifestyle, and multiple chronic health conditions, were associated with increased PCC risk, except for age and sex. Conversely, vaccination was associated with a largely reduced PCC risk, particularly for the cardiopulmonary subtypes. Individuals with PCC experienced a much worse physical and mental health. Specifically, the cardiopulmonary subtype had the most pronounced adverse impact on function impairments, followed by neurological, mild fatigue, and ENT subtype. The most affected functions included the ability to concentrate, participate in day-to-day work, and emotional vulnerability to health problems. PCC can be categorized into four distinct subtypes based on ten core symptoms. These subtypes appeared to share a majority of pathogen and host-related risk factors, but their impact on health varied markedly by subtype. Our findings could help refine current guidelines for precise PCC diagnosis and progression, enhance the identification of PCC subgroups for targeted research, and inform evidence-based policy making to tackle this new and debilitating condition.

This study aimed to identify whether differences occurred in 115 self-reported symptoms and comorbidities in patients diagnosed with hEDS or HSD. In this study we analysed self-reported data from an EDS Clinic intake questionnaire in patients diagnosed with hEDS, HSD or no hypermobile conditions. From 1 November 2019 to 7 March 2024, the EDS Clinic saw 2088 patients. Using the 2017 diagnostic criteria, 66.5% were diagnosed with HSD (n = 1389), 20.3% with hEDS (n = 423), 10.6% with historic HSD (H-HSD) or localized HSD (L-HSD) (n = 256) (hypermobile controls) and 2.6% were not diagnosed with hEDS, HSD, H-HSD or L-HSD (n = 55) (controls). Symptoms/comorbidities that occurred with high prevalence in both hEDS and HSD included joint pain (hEDS 82.0%, HSD 88.9%), allergy (hEDS 77.0%, HSD 77.0%), subluxations (hEDS 71.2%, HSD 72.6%), brain fog (hEDS 70.0%, HSD 74.7%), headache (hEDS 68.1%, HSD 69.1%), anxiety (hEDS 60.3%, HSD 69.3%), depression (hEDS 52.2%, HSD 58.0%), migraine (hEDS 53.7%, HSD 52.5%), nausea (hEDS 54.6%, HSD 59.5%) and constipation (hEDS 53.0%, HSD 57.2%). In contrast, 9/115 (8%) symptoms/comorbidities were self-reported significantly more often in hEDS but 42/115 (37%) in HSD. hEDS patients reported more symptoms that suggest a defect in collagen, such as dislocation, hernias and rectal prolapse, while HSD patients reported more joint, muscle, allergy, neurological, gastrointestinal, sleep and psychological symptoms/comorbidities. Although we found an overlap in some symptoms and comorbidities self-reported by hEDS/HSD patients, such as allergy/atopy, headache/migraine and gastrointestinal symptoms, our findings suggest key differences exist between the two diagnoses, suggesting that hEDS and HSD may be distinct conditions.","2024","2024","Ashley A Darakjian; Mira Bhutani; DeLisa Fairweather; S Christian Kocsis; Jessica J Fliess; Sami Khatib; Gabe J Weigel; Elizabeth J McCabe; Varsini Balamurugan; Evan E Perona; Jessica M Gehin; Emily R Whelan; Angita Jain; Hanna Sledge; David O Hodge; Todd D Rozen; Francis A Farraye; Ozan Soyer; Joseph Cheung; Stephanie L Grach; David Shirey; Shilpa Gajarawala; Bala Munipalli; Chrisandra L Shufelt; Dacre R T Knight; Katelyn A Bruno","Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Center for Clinical and Translational Science, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Center for Clinical and Translational Science, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Sleep Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."

To elucidate the clinical trend of ME/CFS induced by long COVID, we examined data for patients who visited our outpatient clinic established in a university hospital during the period from Feb 2021 to July 2023. Long COVID patients were classified into two groups, an ME/CFS group and a non-ME/CFS group, based on three diagnostic criteria. The prevalence of ME/CFS in the long COVID patients was 8.4% (62 of 739 cases; female: 51.6%) and factors related to ME/CFS were severe illness, smoking and alcohol drinking habits, and fewer vaccinations. The frequency of ME/CFS decreased from 23.9% in the Preceding period to 13.7% in the Delta-dominant period and to 3.3% in the Omicron-dominant period. Fatigue and headache were commonly frequent complaints in the ME/CFS group, and the frequency of poor concentration in the ME/CFS group was higher in the Omicron period. Serum ferritin levels were significantly higher in female patients in the ME/CFS group infected in the Preceding period. In the ME/CFS group, the proportion of patients complaining of brain fog significantly increased from 22.2% in the Preceding period to 47.9% in the Delta period and to 81.3% in the Omicron period. The percentage of patients who had received vaccination was lower in the ME/CFS group than the non-ME/CFS group over the study period, whereas there were no differences in the vaccination rate between the groups in each period. The proportion of long COVID patients who developed ME/CFS strictly diagnosed by three criteria was lower among patients infected in the Omicron phase than among patients infected in the other phases, while the proportion of patients with brain fog inversely increased. Attention should be paid to the variant-dependent trends of ME/CFS triggered by long COVID (300 words).","2024","2024","Satoru Morita; Kazuki Tokumasu; Yuki Otsuka; Hiroyuki Honda; Yasuhiro Nakano; Naruhiko Sunada; Yasue Sakurada; Yui Matsuda; Yoshiaki Soejima; Keigo Ueda; Fumio Otsuka","Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan."

Among long COVID patients, long COVID-associated brain fog is an important area. We noted an immense gap in understanding the genes and associated pathways involved in long COVID-associated brain fog. Therefore, the study has been selected to understand the genes and pathways involved in patients with long COVID-associated brain fog. A GEO dataset, which was developed through the RNA-seq, was used for the analysis. The dataset encompasses 22 human samples of PBMC. The dataset (human samples of PBMC) was grouped into four cohorts for this study: healthy cohort, COVID convalescent, long COVID, and long COVID brain fog. Therefore, the selection criteria for the 22 PBMC samples were based on the individual infection type (COVID convalescent, long COVID, and long COVID brain fog) and the healthy cohort. Using DEG profile evaluation, we revealed 250 top-ranked DEGs with P values, Padj, baseMean, etc. From the top-ranked DEGs, we listed 24 significant DEGs and some significant DEGs are SMAD3 (P value = 6.34e-07), PF4 (P value = 1.88e-05), TNFAIP3 (P value = 3.70e-06), CXCL5 (P value = 1.22e-08), etc. Among the top-ranked DEGs, we found some genes linked with different biological functions, such as inflammatory cytokine secretion, inflammation, microclot formation, and BBB disruption. From our investigation, we found some genes that are associated with this condition, namely PF4, SMAD3, CXCL5, TNFAIP3, etc. From the literature survey and functional pathway enrichment analysis, we noted the function of the genes such as PF4, SMAD3, and CXCL5. We found that PF4 assists in clot formation, and SMAD3 is associated with neuroinflammation. Similarly, CXCL5 is an inflammatory marker associated with neuroinflammation and BBB damage. At the same time, the study with functional pathway enrichment analysis reflects that DEGs of long COVID-related brain fog might be associated with several biological pathways and processes, cell signatures, and gene-disease associations. It reflects that the disease is a highly complex one. Our study will provide an understanding of the genes and associated pathways in long COVID-related brain fog, which will assist in the next-generation biomarker discovery and therapeutics for these patients.","2024","2024 Nov 27","Chiranjib Chakraborty; Manojit Bhattacharya; Abdulrahman Alshammari; Norah A Albekairi; Sang-Soo Lee","Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Adamas University, Kolkata, West Bengal, 700126, India. drchiranjib@yahoo.com.; Department of Zoology, Fakir Mohan University, Vyasa Vihar, Balasore, Odisha, 756020, India.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Post Box 2455, 11451, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Post Box 2455, 11451, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Institute for Skeletal Aging & Orthopaedic Surgery, Hallym University-Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, Chuncheon-Si, Gangwon-Do, 24252, Republic of Korea."

Doxophylline, a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDEI), has anti-inflammatory properties with enhanced blood-brain barrier penetration and tissue specificity. We have evaluated the neuroprotective potential of doxophylline in a murine model of forced swim test (FST) induced CFS and in H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells. An FST model to induce a state of CFS in mice was induced by forcing them to swim daily for 6 min for 15 days. The drug was administered daily 30 min prior to FST. The immobility period was compared for day 1 and day 15. Animals were sacrificed on day 16 for biochemical, mitochondrial, and histopathological estimations in the brain. Cytotoxicity assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear morphology determination were carried out in PC12 cells. A significant increase in immobility has been observed on the 15th day in CFS-induced mice compared to doxophylline treated group. Neurobehavioral studies revealed hypo locomotion, anxiety, motor incoordination, and memory deficit. Biochemical analysis showed a significant change in oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and nitrite levels) and acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity (AChE) in brain homogenates. Doxophylline pre-treatment protects against these impairments. In PC12 cell lines, doxophylline exhibits alleviation against H2O2-induced oxidative stress, intracellular ROS generation, and changes in nuclear morphology. Doxophylline could be promising and possess therapeutic potential in CFS treatment. Further research is needed to test if doxophylline can be repurposed for neurological disorders.","2024","2024 Nov 27","Anushka Vashishth; Garima Sharma; Ankan Sarkar; Monika Kadian; Manish Jain; Anil Kumar","University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Panjab University, Chandigarh, 160014, India.; University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Panjab University, Chandigarh, 160014, India.; University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Panjab University, Chandigarh, 160014, India.; University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Panjab University, Chandigarh, 160014, India.; Department of Pharmacology, MM College of Pharmacy, Maharishi Markandeshwar (Deemed to be University), Mullana-Ambala, Haryana, 133207, India.; University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Panjab University, Chandigarh, 160014, India. jainm@pu.ac.in.; University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Panjab University, Chandigarh, 160014, India. kumaruips@yahoo.com."

Specifically, the incidences of medication overuse headache (MOH) have increased worldwide. Comorbidities of MOH include photosensitivity, anxiety, ""brain fog"", and decreased physical activity. The FDA-approved long-lasting selective β2-adrenergic receptor agonist, formoterol, is currently approved for use in severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recently, interest in repurposing formoterol for use in other disorders including Alzheimer's disease, and neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury has gained traction. Thus, revisiting known side-effects of formoterol, like headache and anxiety, could inform treatment paradigms. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is implicated in the etiology of preclinical headache, with observed decreases in the circulating levels of endogenous cannabinoids, referred to as Clinical Endocannabinoid Deficiency. As cross-talk between the eCB system and adrenergic receptors has been reported, this study investigated the role of the eCB system and ability of formoterol to induce headache-like periorbital allodynic behavior. Female 8-week-old C57Bl/6J mice were treated daily with formoterol (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) for up to 42-days, during which they were assessed for periorbital allodynia, open field/novel object recognition, and photosensitivity. At the end of the study, the periaqueductal grey (PAG), a brain region known to contribute to both headache induction and maintenance, was collected and subjected to LC-MS to quantify endocannabinoid levels. Mice exhibited periorbital allodynia at nearly all time points tested and photosensitivity from 28-days onward. Levels of endocannabinoids, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), along with cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) expression were altered by both age and upon treatment with formoterol. Administration of FAAH/MAGL inhibitors, to target the eCB system, and a non-selective cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN 55,212 reversed the formoterol-induced periorbital allodynia. These results suggest that formoterol is dysregulates eCB tone to drive headache-like periorbital allodynic behaviors. These results could help inform preventative treatment options for individuals receiving formoterol, as well as provide information on the interaction between the eCB and adrenergic system.","2024","2024 Nov 19","Ingrid L Peterson; Erika Liktor-Busa; Kelly L Karlage; Sally J Young; Natalie E Scholpa; Rick G Schnellmann; Tally M Largent-Milnes","Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.; Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.; Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.; Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.; Southern Arizona VA Health Care System, Tucson, AZ, United States.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.; Southern Arizona VA Health Care System, Tucson, AZ, United States.; Southwest Environmental Health Science Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.; Department of Neuroscience, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.; Center for Innovation in Brain Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.; Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States. tlargent@arizona.edu."

Existing research suggests that long COVID patients not only report cognitive symptoms but also exhibit measurable cognitive impairment. Neuroimaging studies have identified structural alterations in brain regions linked to cognitive functions. However, most of these studies have focused on patients within months of their initial infection. This study aims to explore the longer-term cognitive effects and brain structural changes in long COVID patients, approximately two years post-infection, in a cohort from San Martín, Buenos Aires, Argentina. We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 137 participants: 109 with long COVID symptoms and 28 healthy controls. The participants underwent an initial clinical assessment, completed a structured questionnaire and standardised scales, underwent a cognitive assessment, and had a brain MRI scan. Structural MRI images were processed via FreeSurfer and FSL to obtain volumetric measures for subcortical and cortical regions, along with regional cortical thickness. Differences between groups for these variables were analysed using ANCOVA, with permutation tests applied to correct for multiple comparisons. Long COVID patients reported persistent cognitive symptoms such as memory problems and brain fog, with higher levels of fatigue and reduced quality of life compared to controls. Despite subjective cognitive complaints, cognitive tests did not reveal significant differences between groups, except for the TMT-A (p = 0.05). MRI analysis revealed decreased volume in the cerebellum (p = 0.03), lingual gyrus (p = 0.04), and inferior parietal regions (p = 0.03), and reduced cortical thickness in several areas, including the left and right postcentral gyri (p = 0.02, p = 0.03) and precuneus (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). This study highlights the enduring impact of long COVID on quality of life and physical activity, with specific brain structural changes identified two years post-infection. Although cognitive tests did not show clear impairment, the observed brain atrophy and significant reduction in quality of life emphasize the need for comprehensive interventions and further longitudinal studies to understand the long-term effects of long COVID on cognition and brain health.","2024","2024 Nov 18","Sol A Cataldo; Andrea Micciulli; Laura Margulis; Melina Cibeyra; Sabrina Defeo; Silvina G Horovitz; Analía Martino; Raul Melano; Milagros Mena; Francisco Parisi; Diego Santoro; Florencia Sarmiento; Martin A Belzunce","Centro Universitario de Imágenes Médicas (CEUNIM), Escuela de Ciencia y Tecnología, Universidad Nacional de Gral.

The participants' cognitive performance was tested using a cognitive test battery, including the Trail Making Test A/B, the Color-Word Interference Test, and the California Verbal Learning Test. These tests were used to evaluate the cognitive domains of ""attention and processing speed,"" ""verbal learning and memory, "" and ""executive function."" In total, 30 individuals with hypoparathyroidism and 30 healthy controls were included. 24 patients were women (80.0%), with a median age of 44.5±13.1 and a median disease duration of 8.7 years (±5.3). Individuals with chronic hypoparathyroidism showed poorer cognitive performance in ""attention and processing speed"" (F(1,57) = 8.65, p = 0.005*, η² = 0.13) compared to healthy controls. A significantly higher percentage of patients had cognitive deficits in both ""attention and processing speed"" (56.7% vs. 3.3%) and ""executive function"" (60.0% vs. 16.7%). This study provides evidence that cognitive dysfunction, particularly in ""attention and processing speed"" is common in chronic hypoparathyroidism. Recognizing cognitive impairment in these patients is crucial, especially when discussing workability. Neuropsychological training as an adjunct therapy strategy may be beneficial in managing these cognitive deficits.","2024","2024 Nov 15","Adelina Tmava-Berisha; Astrid Fahrleitner-Pammer; Tatjana Stross; Simon Geiger; Christina Geiger; Frederike Fellendorf; Mario Scherkl; Alexander Finner; Anna Holl; Nina Dalkner; Eva Reininghaus; Karin Amrein","Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapeutic Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.; Division of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapeutic Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.; Division of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.; Division of Infectiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapeutic Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.; Division of Pediatric Radiology, Department of Radiology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapeutic Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapeutic Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapeutic Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapeutic Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.; Division of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria."

The aim of this study was to assess, in patients accessing care for Long-COVID, the profile of symptoms reported, the possible clustering of symptoms and cases, the functional status compared to pre-infection, and the impact on working activity. Multicentre cohort study with a collection of both retrospective and prospective data. Demographics, comorbidities, severity and timing of acute COVID, subjective functional status, working activity and presence of 30 different symptoms were collected using a shortened version of the WHO Post COVID-19 Case Report Form. The impact on working activity was assessed in multivariable logistic regression models. Clustering of symptoms was analysed by hierarchical clustering and the clustering of cases by two-step automatic clustering. The study evaluated 1297 individuals (51.5% women) from 30 clinical centres. Men and women had different profiles in terms of comorbidities, vaccination status, severity and timing of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fatigue (55.9%) and dyspnea (47.2%) were the most frequent symptoms. Women reported more symptoms (3.6 vs. 3.1, p < 0.001), with a significantly higher prevalence of memory loss, difficult concentration, cough, palpitation or tachycardia, dermatological abnormalities, brain fog, headache and visual disturbances. Dyspnea was more common in men. In the cluster analysis of the 19 more common symptoms, five aggregations were found: four two-symptom clusters (smell and taste reduction; anxiety and depressed mood; joint pain or swelling and muscle pain; difficult concentration and memory loss) and one six-symptom cluster (brain fog, equilibrium/gait disturbances, headache, paresthesia, thoracic pain, and palpitations/tachycardia). In a multivariable analysis, headache, dyspnea, difficult concentration, disturbances of equilibrium or gait, visual disturbances and muscular pain were associated with reduced or interrupted working activity. Clustering of cases defined two clusters, with distinct characteristics in terms of phase and severity of acute infection, age, sex, number of comorbidities and symptom profile. The findings provide further evidence that Long-COVID is a heterogeneous disease with manifestations that differ by sex, phase of the pandemic and severity of acute disease, and support the possibility that multiple pathways lead to different clinical manifestations.","2024","2024 Nov 14","Marco Floridia; Marina Giuliano; Liliana Elena Weimer; Maria Rosa Ciardi; Piergiuseppe Agostoni; Paolo Palange; Patrizia Rovere Querini; Silvia Zucco; Matteo Tosato; Aldo Lo Forte; Paolo Bonfanti; Donato Lacedonia; Emanuela Barisione; Stefano Figliozzi; Paola Andreozzi; Cecilia Damiano; Flavia Pricci; Graziano Onder; ","National Center for Global Health, Istituto Superiore Di Sanità, Rome, Italy. marco.floridia@iss.it.; National Center for Global Health, Istituto Superiore Di Sanità, Rome, Italy.; National Center for Global Health, Istituto Superiore Di Sanità, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS, Milan, Italy.; Department of Clinical Science and Community Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; IRCCS Ospedale S.

Adult","","Brain Fog; COVID-19; SSTICS; cognitive complaints","The term ""brain fog"" has emerged from the observations of neuropsychiatric conditions present in post-COVID-19 infections. This is characterized by concentration and memory problems, selective attention disorders and difficulties in executive functions, yet it is unclear how long these deficits may persist and which cognitive functions are most vulnerable. Therefore, there is a need to properly evaluate these cognitive complaints using an assessment tool that specifies their intensity and nature. Our primary objective was to explore subjective perceptions of cognitive functioning in COVID-19-associated with brain fog using a tool that was previously validated for assessing subjective cognitive complaints. A total of 68 participants were recruited and the Subjective Scale to Investigate Cognition (SSTICS) was used to assess cognitive complaints. This was the first time that the SSTICS was used for this purpose in subjects with COVID-19. In addition, participants were administered a questionnaire assessing for the presence of various symptoms, as well as COVID-19 clinical parameters. The neuropsychological basis for the construct of the SSTICS was related to the cognitive complaints expressed by participants. A reliability analysis of our sample indicated a high degree of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha= 0.951). Associations between various SSTICS scores and COVID-related symptomatology and the differences between group of participants who reported cognitive complaints (""complainers"") and those who did not were assessed. We performed an exploratory factorial analysis based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Based on their distribution, participants were grouped into: ""good functioning"" - scores 0-9 (35.3%); ""medium functioning"" - scores 14-23 (25%); and ""poor functioning"" - scores 26-71 (39.7%). The mean SSTICS score was 20.59 (SD 16.61) and correlated with the quarantine duration and loss of smell. Complainers differed significantly from non-complainers in the total number of symptoms, the quarantine duration and the presence/absence of specific symptoms, such as loss of smell, tiredness and aches/pains. Our study showed that >10% of patients reported subjective cognitive complaints following COVID-19, with most reporting mild or serious cognitive complaints, mostly within the domains of memory, attention, language, executive functioning or praxis.","2024","2024 Nov 12","Emmanuel Stip; Alyazia Abdulla Alkaabi; Mohammed AlAhbabi; Fadwa Al-Mugaddam; Ovidiu Lungu; Marwan Faisal Albastaki; Saleh Darweesh Alhammadi; Karim Abdel Aziz","College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.; Hospitalier Universitaire de Montreal (CHUM), Université de Montréal, Montreal, Canada.; Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Canada.; Behavioural Science Institute, Al-Ain Hospital, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.; Behavioural Science Institute, Al-Ain Hospital, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.; College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.; Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Canada.; College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.; College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.; College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates."

We explored the frequency and symptom types of long COVID. Correlation analysis was done on the neuropsychological scale results. After cluster analysis, lasoo regression and logistic regressions, a nomogram prediction model was produced as a result of investigating the risk factors for fatigue. A total of 108 (48.4%) of the 223 non-severe COVID-19 patients reported sequelae for more than 4 weeks, and of these, 35 (15.7%) had fatigue sequelae that were scale-confirmed. Other sequelae of more than 10% were brain fog (n = 37,16.6%), cough (n = 26,11.7%) and insomnia (n = 23,10.3%). A correlation between depression and fatigue was discovered following the completion of neuropsychological scale. The duration of hospitalization, the non-use of antiviral medications in treatment, IL-6 and CD16+CD56+ cell levels in blood are the main independent risk factors and predictors of fatigue sequelae in long COVID. Additionally, the neurology diseases and vaccination status may also influence the fatigue sequelae. Nearly half of the patients infected with COVID-19 Omicron variant complained of sequelae, and fatigue was the most common symptom, which was correlated with depression. Significant predictors of fatigue sequelae included length of hospitalization, non-use of antiviral drug, and immune-related serum markers of IL-6 and CD16+CD56+ NK cell levels. The presence of neurology diseases and a lack of vaccination could also predict the occurrence of fatigue sequelae.","2024","2024 Dec","Xiao-Lei Shen; Yu-Han Jiang; Shen-Jie Li; Xin-Yi Xie; Yu Cheng; Li Wu; Jun Shen; Wei Chen; Jian-Ren Liu","Department of Neurology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China.; Department of Neurology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China.; Department of Neurology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China.; Department of Neurology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China.; Department of Neurology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China.; Department of Neurology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China.; Department of Neurology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China.; Department of Neurology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China.; Department of Neurology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China."

Patients undergoing lactulose breath testing (LBT) for clinical assessment of SIBO filled out a demographic questionnaire, including an inquiry about the presence of BF, a symptom questionnaire (PAGI-SYM), and a BF Questionnaire (BFQ; 20 BF symptoms rated never=0 to always=4, total score 0 to 80). A total of 102 patients underwent LBT, with the most common indication being bloating (67%), of whom 55 (54%) reported BF. The BFQ score was significantly higher in patients reporting BF than those not [38.2±15.6 vs. 10.9±9.4 (SEM) (P=0.001)].

Neurolaw is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to translate the rapid and voluminous advances in brain science into legal decisions and policy.

Here in this Viewpoint article, we pair original court transcripts with emergent research in neurolaw, including nutritional neuroscience, microbiome sciences (legalome), pre-clinical mechanistic research, and clinical intervention trials. Advances in neuroscience, and related fields such as the microbiome, are challenging basic assumptions in the criminal justice system, including notions of universal free will. Recent dismissals of criminal charges related to auto-brewery syndrome demonstrate that courts are open to advances at the intersection of neuromicrobiology and nutritional neuroscience, including those that relate to criminal intent and diminished capacity. As such, it is our contention that experts in the neurosciences will play an increasing role in shaping research that underpins 21st-century courtroom discourse, policy, and decision-making.","2024","2024 Sep","Susan L Prescott; Kathleen F Holton; Christopher A Lowry; Jeffrey J Nicholson; Alan C Logan","Nova Institute for Health, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA; susan.prescott@uwa.edu.au.; School of Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.; Departments of Health Studies and Neuroscience, American University, Washington, DC 20016, USA; holton@american.edu.; Department of Integrative Physiology, Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Center for Neuroscience, and Center for Microbial Exploration, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO 80309, USA; christopher.lowry@colorado.edu.; Law and Government, Humber College Institute of Technology & Advanced Learning, Toronto, ON M9W 5L7, Canada; jeffrey.nicholson@humber.ca.; Nova Institute for Health, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA; susan.prescott@uwa.edu.au."

This positions the LBV between the manubrium sterni anteriorly and the innominate artery posteriorly. This pattern of adjacency of the aorta to the LBV is unique to mammals and results from a quirk of evolution. With age, the ascending aorta unfolds, elongates and dilates. Simultaneously, there is a change in the thoracic geometry that reduces the thoracic volume primarily from disc height loss and kyphosis. These transitions progressively compress the LBV. Normally, this compression is circumvented via collateral pathways and ""Blood finds a way"". However, traversing these circuitous pathways comes at a cost and can result in delayed transit times and venous congestion. While it is possible that compression of the LBV in the setting of adequate collateral channels may fail to provoke any pathologic sequelae, we propose a phenomenon in which such compression in the setting of inadequate collateral circulation may lead to a state of pathologic venous congestion. This anatomic anomaly and its associated clinical features, if identified, can offer a new avenue for treatment options for some of the hitherto unexplained neurologic disorders.","2024","2024 Oct 17","Karthikeyan M Arcot; Vincent S DeOrchis","St. Francis Hospital & Heart Center 100 Port Washington Blvd, Roslyn, NY 11576, USA.; Department of Neurology, New York University Langone Hospital Long Island 259 First St, Mineola, NY 11501, USA.; St. Francis Hospital & Heart Center 100 Port Washington Blvd, Roslyn, NY 11576, USA."

The results highlighted differences between younger and older adults in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) global score, as expected in consideration of the different physiological conditions of the two populations. However, memory performance highlighted the two groups as characterized by a difference in patterns of recall that may move beyond a physiological explanation and provide information about COVID-19 cognitive sequelae.

Bright light treatment is a standard procedure for treating seasonal affective disorder and prodromal Parkinson's disease with high success. With the post-encephalitic symptoms of long-COVID closely approximating those of prodromal Parkinson's disease, we treated insomnia and sleep-related parameters in these patients, including total sleep, number of awakenings, tendency to fall back to sleep, and fatigue, to determine whether mending sleep could improve quality of life. We present three female and two male Caucasian patients aged 42-70 years with long-COVID that persisted from 12 weeks to 139 weeks after contracting coronavirus disease. A light presentation protocol was adapted for long-COVID that not only restored sleep in all patients, but also unexpectedly repaired the depression, anxiety, and cognitive changes (brain fog) as well. A robust pattern of recovery commencing 4-5 days after treatment and was maintained for weeks to months without relapse. These preliminary findings represent a novel, minimally invasive approach for managing the most debilitating symptoms of long-COVID, making it an ideal candidate for the drug hypersensitive, post-encephalitic brain.

More women are demanding consultancy and help from their doctors via different channels, be it online or in menopause centers.The term genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) comprises vaginal and urological symptoms such as mucosal dryness, itching and burning, dysuria or bleeding and pain during sexual intercourse. GSM can strongly affect quality of life, is common if estrogen deficiency has lasted for 3 months and can be treated locally with very low doses of the weak estrogen estriol.""Not feeling like myself anymore"" - symptomatic perimenopause may present with sleep disturbances, mastalgia, mood swings, palpitations, panic attacks, but also entail joint pain, vertigo, headache, and brain fog - even years before menopause and in the presence of still adequate estrogen levels. In an online study, 20% of women in the menopausal transition reported symptoms which they could not explain, and which may cause fears of serious illness. This can lead to extensive medical work-ups if the possibility of perimenopause as the cause is disregarded.(Peri-)menopausal complaints last much longer than previously thought: The Study of women's health across the nation (SWAN) reported longer duration of vasomotor symptoms (median: 11,8 years) in women who were already affected in early perimenopause, while those in whom VMS started only after menopause experienced a shorter duration of symptoms (median: 3,4 years).Female hormones protect women from fatty streaks and hypertension, but menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has positive effects only if started in the first decade after menopause. The interaction with stress, aging and lifestyle factors is complex.For the treatment of VMS, German and international guidelines list both drug and non-drug or non-prescription options, although there is no clear data on their effectiveness.Fezolinetant, a Neurokinin-3 receptor antagonist, is now available in Germany for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women with contraindications or aversion against steroid hormones. It modulates the thermoregulation center in the hypothalamus by blocking the KNDy-neurons. Studies on Elinzanetant, another representative of this class of drugs, are still ongoing.","2024","2024 Nov","Katharina Tropschuh; Vanadin Seifert-Klauss","Frauenklinik, Universitätsklinikum rechts der Isar, München, Germany.; Frauenklinik, Universitätsklinikum rechts der Isar, München, Germany."

CI is an international public health and clinical concern, but few resources are available to address patients' often disabling symptoms. Numerous studies show that levels of indoor air pollutants can be two to five (or more) times higher than outdoor levels. Fragranced consumer products, including cleaning supplies, air fresheners, and personal care products, are symptom triggers commonly reported by susceptible individuals. A team of professionals trained and led by a physician/industrial hygienist and a certified indoor air quality specialist conducted a series of 5 structured EHCs in 37 homes of patients reporting CI. We report three case studies demonstrating that an appropriately structured home intervention can teach occupants how to reduce indoor air exposures and associated symptoms. Symptom improvement, documented using the Quick Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory Symptom Star, corresponded with the reduction of indoor air volatile organic compounds, most notably fragrances. These results provide a deeper dive into 3 of the 37 cases described previously in Perales et al. (2022). We address the long-standing dilemma that worldwide reports of fragrance sensitivity have not previously been confirmed by human or animal challenge studies. Our ancient immune systems' 'first responders', mast cells, which evolved 500 million years ago, can be sensitized by synthetic organic chemicals whose production and use have grown exponentially since World War II. We propose that these chemicals, which include now-ubiquitous fragrances, trigger mast cell degranulation and inflammatory mediator release in the olfactory-limbic tract, thus altering cerebral blood flow and impairing mood, memory, and concentration (often referred to as 'brain fog'). The time has come to translate these research findings into clinical and public health practice.","2024","2024 Oct 22","Rodolfo Rincón; Roger Perales; Raymond F Palmer; Jackie F Forster; Jessica F Hernandez; Bryan Bayles; Carl Grimes; Carlos R Jaén; Claudia S Miller","Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.; Department of Life Sciences, Texas A&M University-San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.; Hayward Score, Carmel, CA93921, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA."

The long-term consequences of the infection are anticipated to unravel in the succeeding years with reports of patients experiencing chronic, debilitating sequelae post-infection commonly referred to as Long COVID. Various Variants of Concern (VoCs) have emerged as the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolved displaying increased infectivity and immune evasiveness. We investigate whether the infecting VoCs affect the sequelae of Long COVID in a Philippine cohort. SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed using RT-PCR followed by Next Generation Sequencing were identified from selected regions of the Philippines and recruited through a retrospective-prospective cohort design. Participants were divided based on the initial infecting VoC or Variant of Interest (VoI) and were subsequently interviewed regarding the presence, intensity, and frequency of key Long COVID symptoms, and followed up on two more separate sessions at least three (3) months apart for a total of three (3) data collection points (S1, S2, S3) to document changes in symptoms throughout the year-long study period. Long COVID symptoms were reported in 88, 82, and 68% of participants in S1, S2, and S3, respectively, showing declining incidence with elapsed time since the first reported infection. General symptoms including headache, fatigue, and post-exertional malaise were the most frequently reported symptoms, while neuropsychiatric symptoms were the second most frequently reported symptoms. In all three (3) sessions, intermittent brain fog, fatigue, and headache were the most frequently reported symptoms in all SARS-CoV-2 variant cohorts. Factors such as age, sex, comorbidities, and disease severity influenced symptom frequency, providing insight into the risk factors that contribute to the prevalence of this disease. A large proportion (>68%) of cases in this Philippine cohort previously infected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants presented with long-term complications of COVID-19 characterized by a highly heterogeneous set of debilitating symptoms.

When hypercalcemia is accompanied by undetectable parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, hyperparathyroidism is rarely considered the diagnosis. Herein, we report the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian woman referred to our hospital for further evaluation of hypercalcemia. Her symptoms included fatigue and brain fog, with undetectable PTH levels. A comprehensive workup, including a series of laboratory and imaging tests, excluded common non-parathyroid causes such as malignancy and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. Ultrasound identified a likely enlarged parathyroid gland, which was further confirmed by a sestamibi scan. After 2 weeks of cinacalcet treatment, the patient's calcium levels decreased, indicating the parathyroid gland as the likely source of hypercalcemia. Parathyroidectomy was subsequently performed, revealing a 1927 mg adenoma. Postoperatively, the patient's calcium levels normalized, PTH levels became detectable within the normal range, and her symptoms resolved, with a marked improvement in energy. This case demonstrates that primary hyperparathyroidism can present with hypercalcemia and undetectable PTH.

There currently are no effective evidence-based therapies available for treating neurologic PCC. To assess the effects of lithium aspartate therapy on PCC fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) enrolling participants in a neurology clinic from November 28, 2022, to June 29, 2023, with 3 weeks of follow-up, was conducted. Subsequently, an open-label lithium dose-finding study with 6 weeks of follow-up was performed among the same participants enrolled in the RCT. Eligible individuals needed to report new, bothersome fatigue or cognitive dysfunction persisting for more than 4 weeks after a self-reported positive test for COVID-19, Fatigue Severity Scale-7 (FSS-7) or Brain Fog Severity Scale (BFSS) score of 28 or greater, Beck Depression Inventory-II score less than 24, and no history of a condition known to cause fatigue or cognitive dysfunction. All participants in the RCT were eligible for the dose-finding study, except for those who responded to the placebo. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. Lithium aspartate, 10 to 15 mg/d, or identically appearing placebo for 3 weeks followed by open-label lithium aspartate, 10 to 15 mg/d, for 2 weeks. In the subsequent dose-finding study, open-label lithium aspartate dosages up to 45 mg/d for 6 weeks were given. Change in sum of FSS-7 and BFSS scores. The scores for each measure range from 7 to 49, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline in the scores of additional questionnaires. Fifty-two participants were enrolled (30 [58%] males; mean [SD] age, 58.54 [14.34] years) and 26 were randomized to treatment with lithium aspartate (10 females) and 26 to placebo (12 female). Two participants assigned to lithium aspartate were lost to follow-up and none withdrew. No adverse events were attributable to lithium therapy. There were no significant intergroup differences for the primary outcome (-3.6; 95% CI, -16.6 to 9.5; P = .59) or any secondary outcomes. Among 3 patients completing a subsequent dose-finding study, open-label lithium aspartate, 40 to 45 mg/d, was associated with numerically greater reductions in fatigue and cognitive dysfunction scores than 15 mg/d, particularly in 2 patients with serum lithium levels of 0.18 and 0.49 mEq/L compared with 1 patient with a level of 0.10 mEq/L. In this RCT, therapy with lithium aspartate, 10 to 15 mg/d, was ineffective for neurologic PCC fatigue and cognitive dysfunction.

Fifty-five nonhospitalized patients with subjective cognitive complaints after COVID infection (24 males and 31 females, mean age: 45.6 ± 14.6 years, mean duration of education: 14.4 ± 3.0 years) finished the study. Neuropsychological assessments included screening tests for overall cognition, and comprehensive tests for memory, executive function, processing speed, and subjective emotional and disease symptoms. Cognitive test scores were converted into Z -scores. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to define cognitive domains across subtest scores. Comprehensive assessments revealed cognitive impairment in 69.1% of patients (<1.5 SD in at least one test). The processing speed (27.3%), memory recall (21.8%), memory learning (20.0%), and inhibitory control (18.2%) were the most affected areas.

We investigated the risk of PCC in an international cohort according to viral variants. We included 7699 hospitalized patients in six centers (January 2020-June 2023); a subset of participants with ≥1 visit over the year after clinical recovery were analyzed. Variants were observed or estimated using Global Data Science Initiative (GISAID) data. Because patients returning for a post COVID-19 visit may have a higher PCC risk, and because the variant could be associated with the probability of returning, we used weighted logistic regressions. We estimated the proportion of the effect of wild-type (WT) virus vs. Omicron on PCC, which was mediated by Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, through a mediation analysis. In total, 1317 patients returned for a post COVID visit at a median of 2.6 (IQR 1.84-3.97) months after clinical recovery. WT was present in 69.6% of participants, followed by the Alpha (14.4%), Delta (8.9%), Gamma (3.9%) and Omicron strains (3.3%). Among patients with PCC, the most common manifestations were fatigue (51.7%), brain fog (32.7%) and respiratory symptoms (37.2%). Omicron vs. WT was associated with a reduced risk of PCC and PCC clusters; conversely, we observed a higher risk with the Delta and Alpha variants vs. WT. In total, 42% of the WT effect vs. Omicron on PCC risk appeared to be mediated by ICU admission. A reduced PCC risk was observed after Omicron infection, suggesting a possible reduction in the PCC burden over time. A non-negligible proportion of the variant effect on PCC risk seems mediated by increased disease severity during the acute disease.","2024","2024 Sep 23","Francesca Bai; Andrea Santoro; Pontus Hedberg; Alessandro Tavelli; Sara De Benedittis; Júlia Fonseca de Morais Caporali; Carolina Coimbra Marinho; Arnaldo Santos Leite; Maria Mercedes Santoro; Francesca Ceccherini Silberstein; Marco Iannetta; Dovilé Juozapaité; Edita Strumiliene; André Almeida; Cristina Toscano; Jesús Arturo Ruiz-Quiñones; Chiara Mommo; Iuri Fanti; Francesca Incardona; Alessandro Cozzi-Lepri; Giulia Marchetti; ","Clinic of Infectious Diseases, San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, Department of Health Science, University of Milan, 20142 Milan, Italy.; Clinic of Infectious Diseases, San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, Department of Health Science, University of Milan, 20142 Milan, Italy.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institute, 17177 Stockholm, Sweden.; Icona Foundation, 20145 Milan, Italy.; Icona Foundation, 20145 Milan, Italy.; School of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte 30130-100, Minas Gerais, Brazil.; School of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte 30130-100, Minas Gerais, Brazil.; School of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte 30130-100, Minas Gerais, Brazil.; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133 Rome, Italy.; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133 Rome, Italy.; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133 Rome, Italy.; Vilnius Santaros Klinikos Biobank, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, 08406 Vilnius, Lithuania.; Clinic of Infectious Diseases and Dermatovenerology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Medical Faculty, Vilnius University, 03101 Vilnius, Lithuania.; Centro Universitário de Lisboa Central, Centro Clínico Académico de Lisboa, 1169-050 Lisboa, Portugal.; Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental, 1449-005 Lisboa, Portugal.; Hospital Juan Graham Casasus, Villahermosa 86126, Tabasco, Mexico.; EuResist Network GEIE, 00152 Rome, Italy.; EuResist Network GEIE, 00152 Rome, Italy.; EuResist Network GEIE, 00152 Rome, Italy.; InformaPRO S.R.L., 00152 Rome, Italy.; Centre for Clinical Research, Epidemiology, Modelling and Evaluation (CREME), Institute for Global Health, UCL, London WC1E 6BT, UK.; Clinic of Infectious Diseases, San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, Department of Health Science, University of Milan, 20142 Milan, Italy."

We administered standardized tests of cognitive function and acquired brain connectivity data using MRI. The COVID-19 group demonstrated significantly lower cognitive function (W = 475, p < 0.001, effect size r = 0.58) and lower functional connectivity in multiple brain regions (mean t = 3.47 ±0.36, p = 0.03, corrected, effect size d = 0.92 to 1.5).

It is unclear whether this condition is related to structural or functional brain changes. In this study, we present a multimodal magnetic resonance imaging study of 36 post-COVID patients and 36 individually matched controls who had a mild form of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) infection from March 2020 to February 2022. This study aimed to investigate structural and functional brain alterations and their correlation with post-COVID symptoms and neurocognitive functions. The study protocol comprised an assessment of physical fatigue [Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)], mental fatigue (Mental Fatigue Scale (MFS)], depression [Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)], anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)], post-COVID Symptoms Severity Score, and neurocognitive status [Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status Update (RBANS)]. The magnetic resonance imaging protocol included morphological sequences, arterial spin labeling (ASL) and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequences. Using these protocols, the assessments of macrostructural abnormalities, perfusion, gray matter density, white matter integrity, and brain connectivity were performed. Post-COVID patients had higher levels of physical fatigue, mental fatigue, depression, and anxiety than controls and showed cognitive impairment in all the RBANS domains except in Visuospatial/Construction. The subjective mental fatigue correlated with objective impaired cognitive ability in the RBANS test, particularly in the Attention domain. There were no differences between patients and controls regarding macrostructural abnormalities, regional volumes, regional perfusion metrics, gray matter density, or DTI parameters. We observed a significant positive correlation between RBANS Total Scale Index score and gray matter volume in the right superior/middle-temporal gyrus (p < 0.05) and a significant negative correlation between the white matter integrity and post-COVID symptoms (p < 0.05) in the same area. The connectivity differences were observed between patients and controls in a few regions, including the right middle frontal gyrus, an important area of convergence of the dorsal and ventral attention networks. We also noted a positive correlation between post-COVID symptoms and increased connectivity in the right temporoparietal junction, which is part of the ventral attention system. In non-hospitalized subjects with post-COVID, we did not find any structural brain changes or changes in perfusion, compared to controls. However, we noted differences in connectivity within an important area for attention processes, which may be associated with post-COVID brain fog.","2024","2024","Serena Fineschi; Markus Fahlström; David Fällmar; Sven Haller; Johan Wikström","Department of Public Health and Caring Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Östhammar Health Care Centre, Östhammar, Sweden.; Department of Surgical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Surgical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Radiology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Surgical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Division of Radiodiagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.; Department of Surgical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Radiology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden."

A telehealth delivered QG SMA was pilot tested among a diverse demographic population within an integrative medicine practice at an academic medical center to assess feasibility and acceptability. This was a feasibility/acceptability pilot study conducted at a large New York City academic medical center's Integrative Health and Wellness center from January to July 2023. A QG instructor-acupuncturist and an integrative medicine physician-acupuncturist co-led 3 separate series (5 Element QG, Eight-Section Brocade, and Joint-Mobilizing/Sinew Strengthening exercises) of weekly 30-45-minute sessions of QG SMA on a weekday afternoon via telemedicine. The first session included an overview of QG and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) research while follow-up sessions included a check-in, didactic demonstration followed by QG practice, and a debrief to answer questions. Video links were provided for home practice. Surveys assessing satisfaction were sent pre/post series. 18 sessions of QG SMA were offered over a 6-month period. A total of 40 unique participants from diverse demographics (gender, race/ethnicity, primary residence) attended, for a total of 197 virtual visits. A total of 20 participants enrolled in Series 1 (8 weeks), 23 enrolled in Series 2 (7 weeks), and 16 enrolled in Series 3 (3cweeks). For each session, group attendance ranged from 8-16 with an average of 11 participants. Attendance was high with participants attending an average of 72% of the sessions. Participants attended 88% of the first 8-week series, 54% of the second 7-week series, and 60% of the third series. Participant interest persisted over time with 35% of the 40 participants attending more than 1 series, and 12.5% attending all 3 series.

Persistent symptoms and reinfection in previously infected individuals are increasing being reported in many countries, but their associations among general populations were seldomly reported. Understanding the association with persistent symptoms of COVID-19 reinfection is essential to develop strategies to mitigate the long-term health and socio-economic impacts of the post-COVID conditions. This study aimed to investigate the incidence of COVID-19 persistent symptoms among previously infected Chinese community residents and explore associations of specific COVID-19 persistent symptoms with reinfection and other factors. A community-based survey was conducted in a southern city of China with about 20 million residents from August 3 to 24, 2023. Face-to-face questionnaires were distributed to a total of 1,485 residents to collect their information about COVID-19 infection, reinfection, specific ongoing persistent symptoms, and other COVID-19 related information. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between specific persistent symptoms and reinfection of COVID-19, along with age, gender, and educational level. Of the 1,485 participants, 1,089 (73.3%) reported they had been infected with COVID-19. Among them, 89.1% reported having ongoing persistent symptoms and 14.2% reported had two or more times of infection. About 20% participants were infected 1 year or more since their initial infection. Fatigue, cough, and headaches were the top 3 symptoms being reported. Participants with reinfection were associated with a higher probability of reporting headaches (OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.06-2.25), loss of or change in smell and/or taste (OR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.27-2.83), impaired sleep (OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.02-2.35), and brain fog (OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.12-2.76). Participants aged 45 and above and who had a bachelor's or higher degree were more likely to report chest tightness or shortness of breath, impaired sleep, and brain fog. During the post-emergency period of COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of ongoing persistent symptoms among Chinese residents remains high. Individuals whose initial infection was longer than 1 year have the highest probability of reporting having multiple symptoms. Reinfection may increase the risk of reporting headaches, loss of or change in smell and/or taste, impaired sleep, and brain fog. It is important to maintain routine syndromic surveillance among previously infected people and provide recommendations for clinical management of individuals with multiple ongoing symptoms.","2024","2024","Dongjing Liu; Binglin Chen; Xuejiao Liao; Zheng Zhang; Sen Wei; Xinxin Han; Yong Xu","The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China.; Shenzhen Research Center for Communicable Disease Diagnosis and Treatment, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shenzhen, China.; School of Public Health and Emergency Management, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.; The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China.; Shenzhen Research Center for Communicable Disease Diagnosis and Treatment, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shenzhen, China.; The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China.; Shenzhen Research Center for Communicable Disease Diagnosis and Treatment, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shenzhen, China.; Longgang District Public Health Services Center, Shenzhen, China.; School of Public Health and Emergency Management, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.; The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China."

According to most recent research, the most common symptom of long-COVID is fatigue, which up to this date lacks a universally accepted definition. This study aimed to investigate neurocognitive and physical manifestations of neurological long-COVID, particularly fatigue and its relation with autonomic disfunction, cognitive impairment (known as, brain fog), and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the study provided insights into predictors of fatigue in long-COVID. The included patients (n=141) were referred to the neuro-long-COVID ambulatory service of Trieste from 30 September 2021-02 March 2022. Patients were given self-reporting questionnaires to screen for fatigue, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms. The questionnaires adopted for these conditions to be assessed were Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), COMPASS-31, Prospective-Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Participants were divided into two groups, fatigued and non-fatigued patients, based on FSS scoring (scores > 4.67 indicate fatigued patients). The questionnaire scores of the two groups were then compared. Fatigued patients had significantly higher scores in COMPASS (p<0.001, Cohen's d=1.077), BDI (p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.862), and PRMQ ( p<0.001, Cohen's d=1.159). Furthermore, the multivariate regression analysis showed that predictors of fatigue in long-COVID were symptomatological burden in acute infection (OR=1.38, 95 % CI 1.020-1.887, p=0.037) and in long-COVID (OR=1.78, 95 % CI 1.133-2.2824, p=0.013), COMPASS-31>16 (OR=3.44, 95 % CI 1240-9.560, p=0.018) and BDI>15 (OR=5.1, 95 % CI 1.715-15.164, p=0.003).

In our prospective observational study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of Salus per aquam (Spa) therapy on post-COVID-19 symptoms and QoL in individuals who suffer from chronic joint, musculoskeletal, skin, and/or respiratory conditions. Methods: A total of 159 individuals undergoing Spa therapy were enrolled, and 78 of them had post-COVID-19 symptoms, assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and modified British Medical Research Council Questionnaire (mMRC-DS scales), as well as the Short Form 36 Health Status Survey (SF-36) questionnaire for QoL. Results: Spa therapy significantly reduced most post-COVID-19 symptoms, especially chronic fatigue, pain, brain fog, and persistent cough (all p < 0.05), as well as physical (+72%) and emotional (+66%) limitations. When stratified by sex, males showed a greater improvement from baseline, while females consistently displayed a higher amelioration in all QoL dimensions. Moreover, full vaccination with 3-4 doses significantly protected against SARS-CoV-2 re-infections and post-COVID-19 development (p < 0.05).

Through single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) analysis, we found that COVID-19 infection triggers the immune responses in microglia and astrocytes and exacerbates oxidative stress in oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs), and neurons. Further investigations revealed that COVID-19 infection elevates LUC7L2 expression, which inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and suppresses the expression of mitochondrial complex genes such as MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND3, MT-ND4L, MT-CYB, MT-CO3, and MT-ATP6.

Common symptoms include fatigue, dyspnoea and cognitive dysfunction ('brain fog'). Over time, these symptoms have an adverse effect on mental health, physical activity and quality of life (QoL). The condition requires innovative and feasible treatment approaches that can be effective and self-managed. Physical activity is essential for good health; however, aerobic exercise or weightlifting may not be suitable for post COVID patients who experience fatigue or breathlessness. The benefits of yoga include improved flexibility, mobility, body strength and balance. It is also shown to reduce symptoms of fatigue and improve breathing efficiency, mental health and QoL. This study protocol describes the rationale and methods for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a yoga-based intervention designed for adults with post COVID. A two-group, parallel, RCT with blinded follow-up assessments. Participants will be randomised with a 1:1 allocation to either a 12-week yoga-based intervention or a 12-week health promotion (active comparison) intervention.

However, recent studies have raised concerns about the potential association between probiotic use and brain fog, a cognitive dysfunction characterized by confusion, impaired judgment, and lack of focus. A 47-year-old male commercial airline captain with over 10000 flight hours presented with a two-month history of bloating, abdominal distension, and irregular bowel habits following a period of occupational stress and irregular dietary habits. The pilot's previous medical history was largely uneventful, with the exception of a long-standing gastritis diagnosis. To manage this condition, he had been on a daily regimen of 20 mg of pantoprazole for approximately eight years. After a telemedicine consultation, he began taking an over-the-counter probiotic supplement containing 16 strains. Within five days, he experienced a significant exacerbation of abdominal symptoms, accompanied by somnolence, difficulty concentrating, and mental fatigue, raising safety concerns given his profession. Functional gastrointestinal examination revealed a distended abdomen with increased bowel sounds. Probiotic-associated brain fogginess was suspected, and the patient was advised to discontinue the supplements. Rifaximin therapy was initiated, resulting in rapid resolution of both gastrointestinal and cognitive symptoms. The clear temporal association between probiotic intake and symptom onset, followed by resolution after antibiotic treatment, suggests a causal relationship. This case highlights the potential risks of unsupervised probiotic use, particularly in safety-sensitive professions such as commercial aviation. Occupational health physicians and aeromedical examiners should be aware of the potential for probiotic-induced brain fog in airline pilots (APs). Prompt recognition and appropriate antibiotic treatment can result in complete symptom resolution and prevent occupational hazards.","2024","2024 Aug","Piercarlo Minoretti","Occupational Health, Studio Minoretti, Oggiono, ITA."

However, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-associated brain fog are unclear, and standardized assessments are lacking. This study aims to develop a scale for brain fog assessment and support clinical practice and research. The 17-item Brain Fog Assessment (BFA) scale was developed using a standardized methodology, including literature review, focus group discussions (FGDs), expert evaluation, and psychometric validation. Eighteen potential items were generated following the literature review. These items were subsequently refined during FGDs, which included input from patients, caregivers, and multidisciplinary experts in neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and psychology. After thorough deliberation and expert evaluation, the item pool was finalized into a 17-item scale. We recruited 1,325 patients recovered from COVID-19 from Chinese communities. Psychometric properties were assessed by reliability and validity analysis. Exploratory factor analysis of the BFA scale revealed a three-factor mode comprising 'cognitive decline' (nine items), 'confusion - disorientation' (five items), and 'fatigue' (three items). The internal consistency of each factor was strong (Cronbach's α: 0.82-0.92). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the model fit, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the scale were satisfactory. The test-retest reliability was strong (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84). Criterion-related validity analysis showed a strong correlation to the Wood Mental Fatigue Inventory (r = 0.70, p < 0.001). Individuals with a higher BFA score tended to score lower on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (r = -0.23, p = 0.015). We established a novel BFA scale to quantify multiple clinical aspects of COVID-19-associated brain fog. Using the BFA scale, fatigue and declining performance in memory, attention, and thought were identified as the main symptoms of COVID-19-associated brain fog. This scale has potential implications for disease monitoring and therapy development for individuals with COVID-19-associated brain fog.","2024","2024 Sep 02","Shaojiong Zhou; Jiahua Xu; Xiaoduo Liu; Aonan Li; Bo Zhao; Chaofan Geng; Tao Wei; Yunzhe Liu; Zhibin Wang; Yi Tang","Department of Neurology & Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Neurological Disorders, Beijing, China.; Psychiatry Research Center, Beijing Huilongguan Hospital, Peking University Huilonguan Clinical Medical School, Beijing, China.; Department of Neurology & Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Neurological Disorders, Beijing, China.; Department of Neurology & Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Neurological Disorders, Beijing, China.; Department of Neurology & Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Neurological Disorders, Beijing, China.; Department of Neurology & Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Neurological Disorders, Beijing, China.; Department of Neurology & Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Neurological Disorders, Beijing, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.; Chinese Institute for Brain Research, Beijing, China.; Department of Neurology & Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Neurological Disorders, Beijing, China.; Department of Neurology & Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Neurological Disorders, Beijing, China.; Neurodegenerative Laboratory of Ministry of Education of the Peoples Republic of China, Beijing, China."

Fibrinogen, the central structural component of blood clots, is abundantly deposited in the lungs and brains of patients with COVID-19, correlates with disease severity and is a predictive biomarker for post-COVID-19 cognitive deficits1,5,8-10. Here we show that fibrin binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, forming proinflammatory blood clots that drive systemic thromboinflammation and neuropathology in COVID-19. Fibrin, acting through its inflammatory domain, is required for oxidative stress and macrophage activation in the lungs, whereas it suppresses natural killer cells, after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fibrin promotes neuroinflammation and neuronal loss after infection, as well as innate immune activation in the brain and lungs independently of active infection. A monoclonal antibody targeting the inflammatory fibrin domain provides protection from microglial activation and neuronal injury, as well as from thromboinflammation in the lung after infection. Thus, fibrin drives inflammation and neuropathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and fibrin-targeting immunotherapy may represent a therapeutic intervention for patients with acute COVID-19 and long COVID.","2024","2024 Sep","Jae Kyu Ryu;

We recruited patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and PASC symptoms lasting more than 6 weeks at the CES University and CES Clinic (Medellín, Colombia). We included 50 post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) and 50 non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP) patients. Long-COVID symptoms, cognitive (NIH Toolbox v2.1-Spanish for 18+), patient-reported (PROMIS) outcomes, and relevant medical history were evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed via generalized linear models. Overall, brain fog (60%), myalgia (42%), and numbness or tingling (41%) were the most common neurological symptoms, while fatigue (74%), sleep problems (46%), and anxiety (44%) were the most common non-neurological symptoms. Compared to NNP, PNP patients showed a higher frequency of abnormal neurological exam findings (64% vs. 42%, p = 0.028). Both groups had impaired quality of life (QoL) in domains of cognition, fatigue, anxiety depression and sleep disturbance, and performed worse on processing speed and attention than a normative population. In addition, NNP patients performed worse on executive function than PNP patients (T-score 42.6 vs. 48.5, p = 0.012). PASC symptoms of anxiety and depression were associated with worse QoL and cognitive outcomes. Brain fog and fatigue remained persistent symptoms across all durations of Long COVID. Our findings highlight the high incidence and heterogeneity of the neurologic symptoms and impacts of Long COVID even more than 2 years from disease onset. Early detection, emotional support and targeted management of Neuro-PASC patients are warranted.","2024","2024","Carolina Hurtado; Diego Fernando Rojas-Gualdrón; Gina S Pérez Giraldo; Esteban Villegas Arbelaez; Salvador Ernesto Medina Mantilla; Mariana Campuzano-Sierra; Santiago Ospina-Patino; Mariana Arroyave-Bustamante; Valeria Uribe-Vizcarra; Daniel Restrepo-Arbelaez; Paul Cardona; Julián Llano-Piedrahita; Santiago Vásquez-Builes; Esteban Agudelo-Quintero; Juliana Vélez-Arroyave; Sebastián Menges; Millenia Jimenez; Janet Miller; Yina M Quique; Igor J Koralnik","School of Medicine, CES University, Medellín, Colombia.; School of Medicine, CES University, Medellín, Colombia.; Neurology Department, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, United States.; Clínica CES, Medellín, Colombia.; Clínica CES, Medellín, Colombia.; School of Medicine, CES University, Medellín, Colombia.; School of Medicine, CES University, Medellín, Colombia.; School of Medicine, CES University, Medellín, Colombia.; School of Medicine, CES University, Medellín, Colombia.; School of Medicine, CES University, Medellín, Colombia.; School of Medicine, CES University, Medellín, Colombia.; School of Medicine, CES University, Medellín, Colombia.; School of Medicine, CES University, Medellín, Colombia.; School of Medicine, CES University, Medellín, Colombia.; School of Medicine, CES University, Medellín, Colombia.; School of Medicine, CES University, Medellín, Colombia.; The Ken & Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, United States.; The Ken & Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, United States.; Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, Chicago, IL, United States.; The Ken & Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, United States."

Among 277 children who completed the follow-up, the prevalence of Long COVID was 23.1%. Chronic cough, fatigue, brain fog, and post-exertional malaise were the most commonly reported symptoms. In the decision tree model for Long COVID, the presence of increased vascular markings, the absence of normal CT findings, and younger age were identified as predictors associated with a higher likelihood of developing Long COVID in children. However, no significant correlation was found between chest CT abnormality and the occurrence of Long COVID. Long COVID in children presents a complex challenge with a significant prevalence rate of 23.1%.

Despite the urgent and overwhelming clinical need, there are currently no proven interventions to treat post-COVID cognitive dysfunction (PCCD). Psychostimulants like methylphenidate may enhance both noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways in mesolimbic and pre-frontal areas, thus improving memory and cognition. We present a case series of six patients who were treated at the Johns Hopkins Post-Acute COVID-19 Team (PACT) clinic for PCCD with methylphenidate 5 - 20 mg in the context of routine clinical care and followed for 4 to 8 weeks. Baseline and post-treatment outcomes included subjective cognitive dysfunction and objective performance on a battery devised to measure cognitive dysfunction in long-COVID patients. Three out of the six patients reported subjective improvement with methylphenidate, one patient described it as ""notable"" and another as ""marked"" improvement in memory and concentration. We also found significant pre-treatment subjective complaints of cognitive dysfunction; however, formal cognitive assessment scores were not severely impaired. A statistically significant difference in pre and post scores, favoring intervention, was found for the following cognitive assessments: Hopkins verbal learning test (HVLT) immediate recall, HVLT delayed recall and category-cued verbal fluency. The current series demonstrates promising neurocognitive effects of methylphenidate for long-COVID cognitive impairment, particularly in recall and verbal fluency domains.","2024","2024 Aug","Phoebe Clark; Paul Rosenberg; Esther S Oh; Ann Parker; Tracy Vannorsdall; Alba Azola; Elizabeth Nickles; Panagis Galiatsatos; Mansoor Malik","Department of Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."

This study investigated if DNA methylation levels of the ACE2 promoter are associated with the development of post-COVID-19 symptomatology in a cohort of COVID-19 survivors who had been previously hospitalized. Non-stimulated saliva samples were obtained from 279 (51.5 male, mean age: 56.5 ± 13.0 years old) COVID-19 survivors who were hospitalized during the first wave of the pandemic. A face-to-face interview in which patients described the presence of post-COVID-19 symptoms (defined as a symptom that started no later than three months after SARS-CoV-2 infection) that they suffered from to an experienced healthcare trainer was conducted. Methylation of five CpG dinucleotides in the ACE2 promoter was quantified using bisulfite pyrosequencing. The percentage of methylation (%) was associated with the presence of the following reported post-COVID-19 symptoms: fatigue, dyspnea at rest, dyspnea at exertion, brain fog, memory loss, concentration loss, or gastrointestinal problems. Participants were assessed a mean of 17.8 (SD: 5.3) months after hospitalization. At that time, 88.1% of the patients experienced at least one post-COVID-19 symptom (mean number for each patient: 3.0; SD: 1.9 post-COVID-19 symptoms). Dyspnea at exertion (67.3%), fatigue (62.3%), and memory loss (31.2%) were the most frequent post-COVID-19 symptoms in the sample. Overall, the analysis did not reveal any difference in the methylation of the ACE2 promoter in any of the CpG locations according to the presence or absence of fatigue, dyspnea at rest, dyspnea at exertion, memory loss, brain fog, concentration loss, and gastrointestinal problems. This study did not find an association between methylation of ACE2 promoter and the presence of post-COVID-19 fatigue, dyspnea, cognitive or gastrointestinal problems in previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors.","2024","2024 Jun 27","César Fernández-de-Las-Peñas; Gema Díaz-Gil; Antonio Gil-Crujera; Stella M Gómez-Sánchez; Silvia Ambite-Quesada; Juan Torres-Macho; Pablo Ryan-Murua; Anabel Franco-Moreno; Oscar J Pellicer-Valero; Lars Arendt-Nielsen; Rocco Giordano","Department of Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, 28922 Alcorcón, Spain.; Center for Neuroplasticity and Pain (CNAP), Sensory Motor Interaction (SMI), Department of Health Science and Technology, Faculty of Medicine, Aalborg University, DK 9220 Aalborg, Denmark.; Research Group GAMDES, Department of Basic Health Sciences, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC), 28922 Alcorcón, Spain.; Research Group GAMDES, Department of Basic Health Sciences, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC), 28922 Alcorcón, Spain.; Research Group GAMDES, Department of Basic Health Sciences, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC), 28922 Alcorcón, Spain.; Department of Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, 28922 Alcorcón, Spain.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor-Virgen de la Torre, 28031 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor-Virgen de la Torre, 28031 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor-Virgen de la Torre, 28031 Madrid, Spain.; Image Processing Laboratory (IPL), Universitat de València, Parc Científic, 46980 Paterna, Spain.; Center for Neuroplasticity and Pain (CNAP), Sensory Motor Interaction (SMI), Department of Health Science and Technology, Faculty of Medicine, Aalborg University, DK 9220 Aalborg, Denmark.; Department of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Mech-Sense, Aalborg University Hospital, DK 9100 Aalborg, Denmark.; Steno Diabetes Center North Denmark, Clinical Institute, Aalborg University Hospital, DK 9100 Aalborg, Denmark.; Center for Neuroplasticity and Pain (CNAP), Sensory Motor Interaction (SMI), Department of Health Science and Technology, Faculty of Medicine, Aalborg University, DK 9220 Aalborg, Denmark.; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Aalborg University Hospital, DK 9100 Aalborg, Denmark."

This questionnaire covers topics that are relevant and important to people with MS and their doctors.The ability to do what you want to do, when you want to do it, is one of the most important concerns for people with MS. This questionnaire could help doctors to record and manage how much MS affects people's lives.MS can bring a range of challenging symptoms such as 'brain fog', tiredness, and problems with movement and balance. Many of these symptoms can make day-to-day activities, like working, very difficult for people with MS. Doctors currently use examinations like the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the MS Functional Composite (MSFC), but these do not fully consider what is important to people living with MS. A questionnaire that specifically measures physical functioning of people with MS could help doctors and people with MS to better understand, communicate and manage the physical effects of MS. In this study, people with MS were asked to help create a questionnaire about physical function that reflects topics that are important to them. The PROMIS®nq physical function - Multiple Sclerosis 15a (the PROMIS® PF MS questionnaire) was successfully created with the help of people with MS. People with MS thought that the PROMIS® PF MS questionnaire covered issues important to their physical function.

This study aimed to identify the prevalence of PASC symptoms among Medicaid enrollees at risk for or living with HIV. Through a web survey, we received 138 valid responses from Medicaid-managed plan members who had received a COVID diagnosis. Participants' mean age was 45.4 years (SD = 11.9) and most were non-Hispanic Black (43.5%) or Hispanic (39.1%). Almost thirty-two percent reported inadequate incomes and 77.5% were HIV-positive. In the overall population, the frequently reported symptoms included neck/back/low back pain, brain fog/difficulty concentrating, bone/joint pain, muscle aches, and fatigue. Findings indicate that there is no statistically significant difference in the prevalence and intensity of PASC symptoms lasting 6 months or more between individuals living with and without HIV. Multiple regression analysis found that the number of PASC symptoms 6 months or longer was independently associated with inadequate incomes and comorbidities (cardiac problems, cancer, fibromyalgia) (R2 = .34). Those with inadequate incomes and comorbidities have more numerous PASC symptoms.

Yet, no empirically-supported treatments exist. This study's objectives were to evaluate feasibility and efficacy, provisionally, of a new rehabilitation approach, Constraint-Induced Cognitive Therapy (CICT), for post-COVID-19 cognitive sequelae. Sixteen community-residents ≥ 3-months post-COVID-19 infection with mild cognitive impairment and dysfunction in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) were enrolled. Participants were randomized to Immediate-CICT or treatment-as-usual (TAU) with crossover to CICT. CICT combined behavior change techniques modified from Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy with Speed of Processing Training, a computerized cognitive-training program. CICT was deemed feasible if (a) ≥80% of participants completed treatment, (b) the same found treatment highly satisfying and at most moderately difficult, and (c) <2 study-related, serious adverse-events occurred. The primary outcome was IADL performance in daily life (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure). Employment status and brain fog (Mental Clutter Scale) were also assessed. Fourteen completed Immediate-CICT (n=7) or TAU (n=7); two withdrew from TAU before their second testing session. Completers were [M (SD)]: 10 (7) months post-COVID; 51 (13) years old; 10 females, 4 males; 1 African American, 13 European American. All the feasibility benchmarks were met.

Although a large body of literature describes symptoms, validating this with objective measures is important. This study aims to identify and describe the effects of Long COVID on cognition, balance, and the retinal fundus, and determine whether the duration of symptoms influences cognitive impairment. This cross-sectional study involved LC volunteers with cognitive complaint from public health centers in northern Barcelona who participated between January 2022 and March 2023. This study collected sociodemographic characteristics, information on substance use, comorbidities, and clinical data related to COVID-19. We measured five cognitive domains using a battery of neuropsychological tests. Balance was assessed through posturography and retinal vascular involvement by retinography. A total of 166 people with LC and cognitive complaints participated, 80.72% were women and mean age was 49.28 ± 8.39 years. The most common self-reported symptoms were concentration and memory deficit (98.80%), brain fog (82.53%) and insomnia (71.17%). The 68.67% presented cognitive deficit in at least one domain, with executive functions being the most frequent (43.98%). The 51.52% of the participants exhibited a dysfunctional pattern in balance, and 9.2% showed some alteration in the retina. There were no statistically significant differences between cognitive impairment and symptom duration. Our findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the pathology associated with Long COVID. They highlight the diversity of self-reported symptoms, the presence of abnormal balance patterns, and some cognitive impairment. These findings underscore the necessity of addressing the clinical management of this condition in primary care through follow-up and the pursuit of multidisciplinary and comprehensive treatment.","2024","2024","Meritxell Carmona-Cervelló;

The clinical picture mimics an acute abdomen and is often misdiagnosed, especially when the patient avoids reporting their cannabis use for legal reasons. We report on the case of a 33-year-old man that was brought to the emergency room with a history of 3 days of non-bloody, non-projectile, and non-bilious brownish vomit, coupled with severe epigastric and left hypochondriac pain, and a slight fever. He was a daily cannabis user for several years and had stopped using a week or so before the onset of the symptoms, as he was traveling to a country with more restrictive cannabis laws. His condition deteriorated rapidly, followed by emergency room attendance, thorough diagnostic work-up, and unsuccessful interventions, including intravenous treatment with the anti-emetic Ondansetron. The patient was referred to a psychiatrist after a suspected psychogenic etiology by the medical team. The history was suggestive of CHS and also included anxious, depressed mood with 'brain fog'. The abdominal pain was the most severe complaint. A combination of tramadol, promethazine, and mirtazapine given on an outpatient basis led to full recovery within 10 days. CHS can occur soon after the interruption of chronic cannabis use and overlap with withdrawal symptom. A combination of anti-histaminergic, opioid-based medication, and antidepressant mirtazapine seemed an effective treatment of CHS, which resulted in a relatively quick recovery.","2024","2024","Yasmine Ei Sherif; Sariah Gouher; Mutaz Mohsin Abualhab; Joseph El-Khoury",""

The study aimed to compare neuropsychological functioning between individuals with and without these persistent subjective complaints. Method: Individuals with and without persistent severe fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength (CIS) fatigue ≥ 35) and difficulty concentrating (CIS concentration ≥ 18) at least 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Neuropsychological assessment was performed on overall cognitive functioning, attention, processing speed, executive functioning, memory, visuo-construction, and language (18 tests). T-scores -1.5 SD below population normative data (T ≤ 35) were classified as ""impaired"". Results: 230 participants were included in the study, of whom 22 were excluded from the analysis due to invalid performance. Of the participants included in the analysis, 111 reported persistent complaints of severe fatigue and difficulty concentrating and 97 did not. Median age was 54 years, 59% (n = 126) were female, and participants were assessed a median of 23 months after first infection (IQR: 16-28). With bivariate logistic regression, individuals with persistent complaints had an increased likelihood of slower information processing speed performance on the Stroop word reading (OR = 2.45, 95%CI = 1.02-5.84) compared to those without persistent complaints. Demographic or clinical covariates (e.g. hospitalization) did not influence this association. With linear regression techniques, persistent complaints were associated with lower t-scores on the D2 CP, TMT B, and TMT B|A. There were no differences in performance on the other neuropsychological tests. Conclusions: Individuals with subjective severe fatigue and difficulty concentrating after COVID-19 do not typically demonstrate cognitive impairment on extensive neuropsychological testing.","2025","2025 Feb","Anouk Verveen; Sander C J Verfaillie; Denise Visser; Dook W Koch; Esmée Verwijk; Gert J Geurtsen; Jeroen Roor; Brent Appelman; Ronald Boellaard; Caroline M van Heugten; Janneke Horn; Hanneke E Hulst; Menno D de Jong; Tanja A Kuut; Tessa van der Maaden; Yvonne M G van Os; Maria Prins; Johanna M A Visser-Meily; Michele van Vugt; Cees C van den Wijngaard; Pythia T Nieuwkerk; Bart van Berckel; Nelleke Tolboom; Hans Knoop","Department of Medical Psychology, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Medical Psychology, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam UMC location Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; GGz inGeest Specialized Mental Health Care, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam UMC location Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Medical Psychology, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Division of Imaging and Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Medical Psychology, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Psychology department, Brain and Cognition, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Medical Psychology, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Medical Psychology, VieCuri Medical Center, Venlo, The Netherlands.; School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.; Center for Experimental and Molecular Medicine, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam UMC location Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Neuropsychology and Psychopharmacology, and Limburg Brain Injury Center, Faculty of Psychology, Neuroscience Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.; Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Intensive Care, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Medical, Health and Neuropsychology, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.; Infectious Diseases, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Medical Microbiology & Infection Prevention, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Medical Psychology, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Center for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, The Netherlands.; Occupational Health Office, Department of Human Resources, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Infectious Diseases, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Infectious Diseases, Amsterdam Institute for Infection and Immunity, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Public Health Service of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Rehabilitation, Physical Therapy Science and Sports, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Internal Medicine, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Center for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, The Netherlands.; Department of Medical Psychology, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam UMC location Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Division of Imaging and Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Medical Psychology, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."

University policy was based on the conception of COVID-19 as short-term, with a defined recovery timeline. Despite perceptions that young people face lower risks for prolonged recovery, our study reveals a different reality.Among 36 students with COVID-19, twelve experienced symptoms for over one month. Ten semi-structured interviews revealed heterogenous recovery experiences: good, mild, moderate, and difficult. We also explored how diverse recoveries interacted with academic work. Lingering symptoms ranged from smell loss to brain fog and prolonged fatigue.The unpredictability of recovery made it difficult to attribute symptoms to COVID-19 or academic work pressure. In the context of expectations to resume academic work, some students failed to recognise their ongoing struggles. An absence of conversation regarding recovery in a demanding academic environment renders diverse recovery experiences invisible. Our findings emphasise the need for a broader conceptualisation of COVID-19 recovery amongst young people and call for further research exploring the interaction between students' illness experiences and the fast-paced academic environment.","2024","2024 Jan","Tennessee Miller; Josien de Klerk","School of Public Health, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA.; Leiden University College, Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs, Leiden University, The Hague, The Netherlands."

Cognitive function, variables indicative of the virus infection itself, and psychosocial variables were collected by telephone interview. Univariate logistic regression and Lasso logistic regression models were used for variable selection which plugged into a multiple logistics model. Overall prevalence of moderate or severe cognitive impairment was 6.3%. Logistic regression showed that sex, religion, smoking status, occupation, self-perceived severity of illness, sleep quality, perceived mental distress after COVID-19, perceived discrimination from relatives and friends, and suffered abuse were associated with cognitive impairment. The long-term consequences of cognitive function are related to multiple domains, in which psychosocial factors should be taken into consideration.","2024","2024 Aug 01","Wen Dang; Wenjing Li; Haotian Liu; Chunyang Li; Tingxi Zhu; Lin Bai; Runnan Yang; Jingyi Wang; Xiao Liao; Bo Liu; Simai Zhang; Minlan Yuan; Wei Zhang","Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Mental Health Center and Psychiatric Laboratory, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Mental Health Center and Psychiatric Laboratory, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Mental Health Center and Psychiatric Laboratory, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Mental Health Center and Psychiatric Laboratory, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Mental Health Center and Psychiatric Laboratory, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China."

A total of 7361 asymptomatic community-dwelling people enrolled in the Test Us at Home parent study between October 2021 and February 2022. Participants self-collected anterior nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing every 24-48 hours for 10-14 days, regardless of symptom or infection status. Participants who had no history of COVID-19 at enrollment and who were subsequently found to have ≥1 positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test during the parent study were recontacted in August 2023 and asked whether they had experienced long COVID, defined as the development of new symptoms lasting 3 months or longer following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participant's cycle threshold values were converted into viral loads, and slopes of viral clearance were modeled using post-nadir viral loads. Using a log binomial model with the modeled slopes as the exposure, we calculated the relative risk of subsequently developing long COVID with 1-2 symptoms, 3-4 symptoms, or 5+ symptoms, adjusting for age, number of symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Adjusted relative risk (aRR) of individual long COVID symptoms based on viral clearance was also calculated. 172 participants were eligible for analyses, and 59 (34.3%) reported experiencing long COVID. The risk of long COVID with 3-4 symptoms and 5+ symptoms increased by 2.44 times (aRR: 2.44; 95% CI: 0.88-6.82) and 4.97 times (aRR: 4.97; 95% CI: 1.90-13.0) per viral load slope-unit increase, respectively. Participants who developed long COVID had significantly longer times from peak viral load to viral clearance during acute disease than those who never developed long COVID (8.65 [95% CI: 8.28-9.01] vs. 10.0 [95% CI: 9.25-10.8]). The slope of viral clearance was significantly positively associated with long COVID symptoms of fatigue (aRR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.22-6.69), brain fog (aRR: 4.94; 95% CI: 2.21-11.0), shortness of breath (aRR: 5.05; 95% CI: 1.24-20.6), and gastrointestinal symptoms (aRR: 5.46; 95% CI: 1.54-19.3). We observed that longer time from peak viral load to viral RNA clearance during acute COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of developing long COVID. Further, slower clearance rates were associated with greater number of symptoms of long COVID. These findings suggest that early viral-host dynamics are mechanistically important in the subsequent development of long COVID.","2024","2024 Jul 05","Carly Herbert; Annukka A R Antar; John Broach; Colton Wright; Pamela Stamegna; Katherine Luzuriaga; Nathaniel Hafer; David D McManus; Yukari C Manabe; Apurv Soni","Program in Digital Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; University of Massachusetts Center for Clinical and Translational Science, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; Program in Digital Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; Program in Digital Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; University of Massachusetts Center for Clinical and Translational Science, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; University of Massachusetts Center for Clinical and Translational Science, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; Program in Digital Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; Division of Health System Science, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Program in Digital Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; Division of Health System Science, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA."

We conducted a hospital-wide prospective study to document the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak among healthcare workers in a hospital of Chengdu, where no previous staff SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected. All hospital staff members were invited to complete an online questionnaire on COVID-19 in January 2023, and SARS-CoV-2 infection cases were followed up by telephone in June 2023 to collect data on long COVID. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 2,899 hospital staff (93.5%) completed the online questionnaire, and 86.4% were infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron. The clinical manifestations of these patients were characterized by a high incidence of systemic symptoms. Cough (83.4%), fatigue (79.8%) and fever (74.3%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Multivariable logistic analysis revealed that females [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-1.88] and clinical practitioners (aOR: 10.32, 95% CI: 6.57-16.20) were associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas advanced age ≥ 60 years (aOR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19-0.49) and a three-dose COVID-19 vaccination with the most recent dose administered within 3 months before 7 December 2022 (aOR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.23-0.87 for within 1 month; aOR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.22-0.97 for within 1-3 months) were associated with reduced risk. Among the cases, 4.27% experienced long COVID of fatigue, brain fog or both, with the majority reporting minor symptoms.

We analyzed a comprehensive cohort dataset comprising 1,009 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Japanese hospitals. To assess brain fog, we analyzed patients who responded to a questionnaire indicating symptoms such as memory impairment and poor concentration. The prevalence of brain fog symptoms decreased 3 months posthospitalization but remained stable up to 12 months. Neurological symptoms such as taste and smell disorders and numbness at hospitalization correlated with a higher frequency of identifying brain fog as a long COVID manifestation. Our findings indicated that advanced age, female sex, a high body mass index, oxygen required during hospitalization, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and elevated C-reactive protein and elevated D-dimer levels were risk factors in patients exhibiting brain fog.

Although it is generally known as a long-term COVID-19 symptom, brain fog has also been reported to be caused by many other diseases. Thus, it is necessary to assess this condition in certain populations. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Brain Fog Scale in a Turkish population. We conducted the study in two phases. In a pilot study including 125 participants, we confirmed the suitability of the scale for validity analyses and then conducted exploratory (n = 230) and confirmatory factor analyses (n = 343). The Cronbach's alpha value of the 23-item Brain Fog Scale was 0.966. In addition, the 23-item and three-factor structure was confirmed as a result of the analyses. These three factors are mental fatigue, impaired cognitive acuity, and confusion. We also found that participants previously diagnosed with COVID-19 had higher brain fog scores. This finding indicates that brain fog is an important condition that can accompany COVID-19. Furthermore, this validated construct has an acceptable fit and is a valid and useful tool for the Turkish population.","2024","2024 Jun 14","Murat Bas; Meryem Kahriman; Cansu Gencalp; Selen Koksal Koseoglu; Ladan Hajhamidiasl","Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul 34752, Türkiye.; Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul 34752, Türkiye.; Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul 34752, Türkiye.; Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul 34752, Türkiye.; Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul 34752, Türkiye."

The aim of this study was to understand the experiences of brain fog and the coping strategies used after SCAD. Participants were recruited from the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute Genetics Study database and considered eligible if their event occurred within 12 months. Seven semi-structured online focus groups were conducted between December and January 2021-22, with this study reporting findings related to brain fog and fatigue. Interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed using an iterative approach. Participants (n = 30) had a mean age of 52.2 (±9.5) and were mostly female (n = 27, 90%). The overarching theme of brain fog after SCAD included four main themes: how brain fog is experienced, perceived causes, impacts, and how people cope. Experiences included memory lapses, difficulty concentrating and impaired judgement, and perceived causes, including medication, fatigue and tiredness, and menopause and hormonal changes. Impacts of brain fog included rumination, changes in self-perception, disruption to hobbies/pastimes, and limitations at work. Coping mechanisms included setting reminders and expectations, being one's own advocate, lifestyle and self-determined medication adjustments, and support from peers. Brain fog is experienced by SCAD survivors, and the impacts are varied and numerous, including the capacity to work. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection survivors reported difficulty understanding causes and found their own path to coping.

People were asked to name their most frequent and most bothersome mental health symptoms affected by PCS using the structure of the Patient Generated Index (PGI). The text threads from the PGI were grouped into topics using BERTopic analysis. 20 topics were identified from 818 text threads referring to PCS mental health symptoms. 35% of threads were identified as relating to anxiety, discussed in terms of five topics: generalized/social anxiety, fear/worry, post-traumatic stress, panic, and nervous. 29% of threads were identified as relating to low mood, represented by five topics: depression, discouragement, emotional distress, sadness, and loneliness. A cognitive domain (22% of threads) was covered by four topics referring to concentration, memory, brain fog, and mental fatigue. Topics related to frustration, anger, irritability. and mood swings (7%) were considered as one domain and there were separate topics related to motivation, insomnia, and isolation. This novel method of digital transformation of unstructured text data uncovered different ways in which people think about classical mental health domains.

The variables were grouped into four categories: demographics, symptoms and functional impairments, comorbidities and potential risk factors (including lifestyle factors), and cognitive score. Univariate methods determined the correlates of brain fog, with long-COVID and non-long-COVID subgroups. XGBoost machine learning model retrospectively characterised subjective brain fog.

XGBoost achieved a training accuracy of 85% with cross-validated accuracy of 74%, and the features most predictive of brain fog in the model were difficulty focusing and following conversations, long-COVID, and severity of migraines. This is the largest study characterising subjective brain fog as an impairment of concentration associated with functional impairments in activities of daily living. Brain fog was particularly associated with a history of long-COVID-19, migraines, concussion, and with 0.1 standard deviations lower cognitive scores, especially on modified Stroop testing, suggesting impairments in the ability to inhibit cognitive interference.

Our primary objective was to identify the incidence of POCD among patients 55 years or older undergoing major gynecologic oncology surgery. This mixed-methods, prospective, observational cohort study followed patients 55 years or older who underwent surgery for gynecologic malignancies between February and July 2022. Semi-structured interviews and the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) were administered before surgery as well as 1 and 3 months after. Assessments were delivered virtually and in-person in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. POCD was defined as ≥2-point decline from baseline MMSE score.

The patient, a 35-year-old Japanese man, was infected with COVID-19 and resumed work approximately 2 weeks later after symptoms improved. Approximately 1 month after returning to work, the patient's concentration became impaired and he started making noticeable errors at work.

Here, he underwent blood tests, electroencephalography, and head magnetic resonance imaging, which did not reveal any abnormalities. Cognitive decline due to COVID-19 sequelae was therefore suspected, prompting his evaluation in our department approximately 5 months after his initial COVID-19 infection. Detailed cognitive function tests were performed. He was monitored without the use of medications, and his cognitive function gradually improved. Approximately 11 months after his initial COVID-19 infection, the same cognitive function tests were conducted again, because his subjective cognitive function symptoms had disappeared, and improvement was observed in many items.

The present study sought to investigate the profile of objective and subjective cognitive difficulties in people who have Post-COVID Syndrome, people who have fully recovered from an acute COVID infection and people who have never had COVID-19. We further sought to explore the extent to which self-reported fatigue and stress are related to subjective and objective cognitive difficulties. 162 participants including 50 people living with Post-COVID Syndrome, 59 people who have had COVID-19 but have fully recovered and 53 people who have never experienced symptoms of COVID-19 and had never tested positive for COVID-19 were recruited from Academic Prolific to complete a series of online questionnaires and neurocognitive tasks. Subjective cognitive function was measured using the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire and objective cognitive function was measured using the Cognitron cognitive test battery. We found that objective and subjective measures of cognitive function were not significantly related, suggesting that self-reports of ""brain fog"" are not reflecting objectively measured cognitive dysfunction. A MANOVA revealed that subjective cognitive deficits were driven by heightened perceived stress and fatigue and not significantly related to COVID-19 status. Objective cognitive function, however, was significantly related to perceived stress and COVID status whereby we observed significant objective cognitive deficits in people who have been exposed to an acute COVID-19 infection regardless of whether they had Post-COVID Syndrome or had fully recovered, as compared to people who had never had COVID-19. This suggests that an acute infection can have long term effects on cognitive function, even without persistent COVID-19 symptoms. Encouragingly, objective cognitive function was significantly associated with time since initial infection showing that cognitive deficits improved over time for people who had recovered from COVID-19. However, we did not observe the same improvement in individuals with Post-COVID Syndrome and observed that cognitive dysfunction was significantly related to the number of neurological symptoms presently experienced. These results add to the accumulating literature that COVID-19 is associated with significant cognitive difficulties following a COVID-19 infection, which appear to improve over time for those who have recovered from COVID-19 yet persist in people living with Post-COVID Syndrome.","2024","2024 Jun 11","A R Bland; M Barraclough; W R Trender; M A Mehta; P J Hellyer; A Hampshire; I K Penner; R Elliott; S Harenwall","Department of Psychology, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK. a.bland@mmu.ac.uk.; Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.; NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.; Department of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Department of Neurology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Division of Psychology and Mental Health, School of Health Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.; Primary Care Wellbeing Service, Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust, Bradford, UK."

To assess the efficacy of a 15-day course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in reducing the severity of select PASC symptoms. This was a 15-week blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted from November 2022 to September 2023 at Stanford University (California). The participants were adults with moderate to severe PASC symptoms of 3 months or longer duration. Participants were randomized 2:1 to treatment with oral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (NMV/r, 300 mg and 100 mg) or with placebo-ritonavir (PBO/r) twice daily for 15 days. Primary outcome was a pooled severity of 6 PASC symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, body aches, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cardiovascular symptoms) based on a Likert scale score at 10 weeks. Secondary outcomes included symptom severity at different time points, symptom burden and relief, patient global measures, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures, orthostatic vital signs, and sit-to-stand test change from baseline. Of the 155 participants (median [IQR] age, 43 [34-54] years; 92 [59%] females), 102 were randomized to the NMV/r group and 53 to the PBO/r group. Nearly all participants (n = 153) had received the primary series for COVID-19 vaccination. Mean (SD) time between index SARS-CoV-2 infection and randomization was 17.5 (9.1) months. There was no statistically significant difference in the model-derived severity outcome pooled across the 6 core symptoms at 10 weeks between the NMV/r and PBO/r groups. No statistically significant between-group differences were found at 10 weeks in the Patient Global Impression of Severity or Patient Global Impression of Change scores, summative symptom scores, and change from baseline to 10 weeks in PROMIS fatigue, dyspnea, cognitive function, and physical function measures. Adverse event rates were similar in NMV/r and PBO/r groups and mostly of low grade. The results of this randomized clinical trial showed that a 15-day course of NMV/r in a population of patients with PASC was generally safe but did not demonstrate a significant benefit for improving select PASC symptoms in a mostly vaccinated cohort with protracted symptom duration. Further studies are needed to determine the role of antivirals in the treatment of PASC.

To distinguish between COVID-19-related symptoms and health limitations from those caused by other conditions, it is essential to compare cases with community controls using prospective data ensuring case-control status. The RESPIRA study addresses this need by investigating the lasting impact of COVID-19 on Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and symptomatology in a population-based cohort in Costa Rica, thereby providing a robust framework for controlling HRQoL and symptoms. The study comprised 641 PCR-confirmed, unvaccinated cases of COVID-19 and 947 matched population-based controls. Infection was confirmed using antibody tests on enrollment serum samples and symptoms were monitored monthly for 6 months post-enrolment. Administered at the 6-month visit (occurring between 6- and 2-months post-diagnosis for cases and 6 months after enrollment for controls), HRQoL and Self-Perceived Health Change were assessed using the SF-36, while brain fog, using three items from the Mental Health Inventory (MHI). Regression models were utilized to analyze SF-36, MHI scores, and Self-Perceived Health Change, adjusted for case/control status, severity (mild case, moderate case, hospitalized) and additional independent variables. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the findings. Cases showed significantly higher prevalences of joint pain, chest tightness, and skin manifestations, that stabilized at higher frequencies from the fourth month post-diagnosis onwards (2.0%, 1.2%, and 0.8% respectively) compared to controls (0.9%, 0.4%, 0.2% respectively). Cases also exhibited significantly lower HRQoL than controls across all dimensions in the fully adjusted model, with a 12.4 percentage-point difference [95%CI: 9.4-14.6], in self-reported health compared to one year prior. Cases reported 8.0% [95%CI: 4.2, 11.5] more physical limitations, 7.3% [95%CI: 3.5, 10.5] increased lack of vitality, and 6.0% [95%CI: 2.4, 9.0] more brain fog compared to controls with similar characteristics. Undiagnosed cases detected with antibody tests among controls had HRQoL comparable to antibody negative controls. Differences were more pronounced in individuals with moderate or severe disease and among women. PCR-confirmed unvaccinated cases experienced prolonged HRQoL reductions 6 months to 2 years after diagnosis, this was particularly the case in severe cases and among women. Mildly symptomatic cases showed no significant long-term sequelae.","2024","2024 Jun 04","Cristina Barboza-Solis; Romain Fantin; Allan Hildesheim; Ruth Pfeiffer; Carolina Porras; Julia Butt; Tim Waterboer; Henriette Raventós; Arturo Abdelnour; Amada Aparicio; Viviana Loria; D Rebecca Prevots; Mitchell H Gail; Rolando Herrero; ","Facultad de Odontología, Universidad de Costa Rica, San José, Costa Rica. cristina.barbozasolis@ucr.ac.cr.; Agencia Costarricense de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Fundación INCIENSA, San José, Costa Rica.; Agencia Costarricense de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Fundación INCIENSA, San José, Costa Rica.; Biostatistics Branch, Division of Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Agencia Costarricense de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Fundación INCIENSA, San José, Costa Rica.; Division of Infections and Cancer Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.; Division of Infections and Cancer Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.; Centro de Investigación en Biología Celular y Molecular, Universidad de Costa Rica, San José, Costa Rica.; Escuela de Biología, Universidad de Costa Rica, San José, Costa Rica.; Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, San José, Costa Rica.; Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, San José, Costa Rica.; Agencia Costarricense de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Fundación INCIENSA, San José, Costa Rica.; Epidemiology and Population Studies Unit, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Rockville, MD, USA.; Biostatistics Branch, Division of Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, 9609 Medical Center Drive RM 7-E138, MSC 9780, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.; Agencia Costarricense de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Fundación INCIENSA, San José, Costa Rica."

Among the most common and debilitating manifestations, cognitive fog is a neurological disorder characterized by mental confusion and cognitive difficulties. In this study, we investigated the long-term effects of previous Covid-19 infection on cortical brain activity in patients experiencing cognitive fog symptoms in the medium and long term. A total of 40 subjects (20 females and 20 males) aged between 45 and 70 years (mean age (M) = 59.78, standard deviation (SD) = 12.93) participated in this study. This sample included individuals with symptoms of cognitive fog, both with and without anosmia, and a control group comprised of healthy subjects. All electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected in two sessions, 1 month and 8 months after recovery from Covid-19, to measure the neurophysiological parameters of P300 and beta band rhythms. The results revealed significant differences in the neurophysiological parameters of P300 and beta band rhythms in subjects affected by cognitive fog, and these alterations persist even 8 months after recovery from Covid-19. Interestingly, no significant differences were observed between the participants with anosmia and without anosmia associated with cognitive fog. These findings provide a significant contribution to understanding the long-term effects of Covid-19 on the brain and have important implications for future interventions aimed at managing and treating brain fog symptoms. The longitudinal assessment of cortical brain activity helps highlight the persistent impact of the virus on the neurological health of Long-Covid patients.","2024","2024 May 20","Antonio Gangemi; Rossella Suriano; Rosa Angela Fabio","I.R.C.S.S.

The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using web scraping to support the development of a new PRO measure for breast implant illness (BII). Nine publicly available BII-specific web forums were chosen post-consultation with two prominent BII advocacy leaders. The Python Selenium and Pandas packages were used to automate extraction of de-identified text from the individual posts/comments into a spreadsheet. Data were coded using a line-by-line approach and constant comparison was used to create top-level domains and sub-domains. 6362 unique codes were identified and organized into four top-level domains of information needs, symptom experiences, life impact of BII, and care experiences. Information needs of women included seeking/sharing information pre-breast implant surgery, post-breast implant surgery, while contemplating explant surgery, and post-explant surgery. Symptoms commonly described by women included fatigue, brain fog, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Many comments described BII's impact on daily activities and psychosocial wellbeing. Lastly, some comments described negative care experiences and experiences related to advocating for themselves to providers. This proof-of-concept study demonstrated the feasibility of employing web scraping as a cost-effective, efficient method to understand the experiences of women with BII.

Cognitive dysfunction can severely impair quality of life by impairing daily functional skills and preventing timely return to work. RECOVER-NEURO is a prospective, multi-center, multi-arm, phase 2, randomized, active-comparator design investigating 3 interventions: (1) BrainHQ is an interactive, online cognitive training program; (2) PASC-Cognitive Recovery is a cognitive rehabilitation program specifically designed to target frequently reported challenges among individuals with brain fog; (3) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive form of mild electrical brain stimulation. The interventions will be combined to establish 5 arms: (1) BrainHQ; (2) BrainHQ + PASC-Cognitive Recovery; (3) BrainHQ + tDCS-active; (4) BrainHQ + tDCS-sham; and (5) Active Comparator. The interventions will occur for 10 weeks. Assessments will be completed at baseline and at the end of intervention and will include cognitive testing and patient-reported surveys. All study activities can be delivered in Spanish and English. This study is designed to test whether cognitive dysfunction symptoms can be alleviated by the use of pragmatic and established interventions with different mechanisms of action and with prior evidence of improving cognitive function in patients with neurocognitive disorder.

We sought to objectify CS in PC patients using routine diagnostic assessments: neurocognitive testing (NCT) and brain imaging (BI). Further, we investigated possible associations of CS with patient reported outcomes (PROs), and risk factors for developing CS. Clinical data and PROs of 315 PC patients were assessed at a mean of 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 231 (73.3%) patients reported any sort of CS. Among them, 78 underwent NCT and 55 received BI. In NCT, the cognitive domains most affected were the working memory, attention, and concentration. Nonetheless, pathological thresholds were exceeded only in few cases. Neurocognitive performance did not differ significantly between patients complaining of severe (n = 26) versus non-severe (n = 52) CS. BI findings were abnormal in 8 (14.5%) cases with CS but were most likely not related to PC. Patients reporting high severity of CS scored worse in the PHQ-9, FSS, WHOQOL-BREF, were more likely to report impaired sleep, and had a higher prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses. Overall, NCT could confirm mild impairment in some but not all PC patients with CS, while BI studies were abnormal in only few cases. CS severity did not affect NCT results, but severe CS were associated with symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), fatigue (FSS), reduced quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF) and higher prevalence of psychiatric illnesses. These findings support the importance of NCT, BI, and neuro-psychological assessment in the work-up of PC patients reporting CS.

The aim of this study is to investigate the cardiovascular system-related symptoms of outpatients and inpatients of the Cardiovascular Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine after recovery from novel coronavirus infection, analyze the influencing factors, and symptom characteristics of related symptoms, and thereby provide a basis for further formulating a reasonable diagnosis and treatment plan. From January 15, 2023 to February 15, 2023, 452 recovered patients with novel coronavirus infection who were admitted to the Cardiovascular Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine due to symptoms of the cardiovascular system (complaints of chest pain and palpitations) were involved in this study. A unified questionnaire was used to record the general information, past medical history, characteristics of chest pain or palpitations, and other COVID-19-related sequelae of the selected patients. All data were statistically analyzed by SPSS 26.0 statistical software. A total of 226 patients with cardiovascular symptoms and 226 patients without cardiovascular symptoms were included in this study. After univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, women (OR 2.081, 95% CI = 1.358-3.189) and young people (OR 2.557, 95% CI = 1.44-4.54) had a higher risk of cardiovascular symptoms; prehypertension (OR 1.905, 95% CI = 1.091-3.329) and hypertension (OR 2.287, 95% CI = 1.433-3.649) increased the risk of cardiovascular symptoms; patients with history of previous cardiovascular disease (OR 1.862, 95% CI = 1.16-2.988) and history of diabetes (OR 2.138, 95% CI = 1.058-4.319) had a higher risk of developing cardiovascular symptoms. The main symptoms related to COVID-19 sequelae reported by all 452 patients were fatigue (76.8%), shortness of breath (54.2%), dry mouth and bitter mouth (46.0%), gastrointestinal symptoms (42.7%), sleep disturbances (37.4%), sweating (31.9%), chills (29%), dizziness (25.7%), confusion of brain fog (25.2%), and tinnitus (14.6%). Compared with patients without cardiovascular symptoms, patients with cardiovascular symptoms were more likely to have shortness of breath (OR 3.521, 95% CI = 2.226-5.472), gastrointestinal symptoms (OR 2.039, 95% CI = 1.226-3.393), and dry mouth and bitter mouth (OR 1.918, 95% CI = 1.229-2.992). The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). In this new coronavirus infection, women, young people, the elderly, people with prehypertension, hypertension, and patients with a history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular symptoms, and patients with cardiovascular symptoms are more likely to develop other COVID-19 sequelae.","2024","2024","Xiaoyu Zhao; Dongli Wang; Yongzhi Chen; Na Zhang; Tianshu Li; Ruixia Fan; Lei Yang; Chuanhua Yang; Jie Yang","School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong Province, 250014, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong Province, 250014, China.; Department of Cardiovascular, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong Province, 250014, China.; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong Province, 250014, China.; School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong Province, 250014, China.; School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong Province, 250014, China.; First School of Clinical Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong Province, 250014, China.; Department of Cardiovascular, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong Province, 250014, China.; Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China."

We aimed to (i) report the prevalence and characteristics of children and young people (CYP) reporting ""brain fog"" (i.e., cognitive impairment) 12-months post PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection and determine whether differences by infection status exist and (ii) explore the prevalence of CYP experiencing cognitive impairment over a 12-month period post-infection and investigate the relationship between cognitive impairment and poor mental health and well-being, mental fatigue and sleep problems. The Omicron CLoCk sub-study, set up in January 2022, collected data on first-time PCR-test-positive and PCR-proven reinfected CYP at time of testing and at 3-, 6- and 12-months post-testing. We describe the prevalence of cognitive impairment at 12-months, indicating when it was first reported. We characterise CYP experiencing cognitive impairment and use chi-squared tests to determine whether cognitive impairment prevalence varied by infection status. We explore the relationship between cognitive impairment and poor mental health and well-being, mental fatigue and trouble sleeping using validated scales. We examine associations at 3-, 6- and 12-months post-testing by infection status using Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. At 12-months post-testing, 7.0 % (24/345) of first-positives and 7.5 % (27/360) of reinfected CYP experienced cognitive impairment with no difference between infection-status groups (p = 0.78). The majority of these CYP experienced cognitive impairment for the first time at either time of testing or 3-months post-test (no difference between the infection-status groups; p = 0.60). 70.8 % of first-positives experiencing cognitive impairment at 12-months, were 15-to-17-years-old as were 33.3 % of reinfected CYP experiencing cognitive impairment (p < 0.01). Consistently at all time points post-testing, CYP experiencing cognitive impairment were more likely to score higher on all Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire subscales, higher on the Chalder Fatigue sub-scale for mental fatigue, lower on the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale and report more trouble sleeping. CYP have a fluctuating experience of cognitive impairment by 12-months post SARS-CoV-2-infection. Cognitive impairment is consistently correlated with poorer sleep, behavioural and emotional functioning over a 12-month period. Clinicians should be aware of cognitive impairment post-infection and its co-occurring nature with poorer sleep, behavioural and mental health symptoms.","2024","2024 Jul","Paul Foret-Bruno; Roz Shafran; Terence Stephenson; Manjula D Nugawela; Dennis Chan; Shamez Ladhani; Kelsey McOwat; Anna Mensah; Ruth Simmons; Lana Fox Smith; Anaïs D'oelsnitz; Laila Xu; Emma Dalrymple; Isobel Heyman; Tamsin Ford; Terry Segal; Trudie Chalder; Natalia Rojas; Snehal M Pinto Pereira; ","Institut de Psychologie, Université Lumière Lyon 2, 18 Quai Claude Bernard 69365 LYON Cedex 07, France.; UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Alexandra House, London, WC1N 3AZ, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; Immunisations and Vaccine Preventable Diseases, UK Health Security Agency, 61 Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5EQ, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; Immunisations and Vaccine Preventable Diseases, UK Health Security Agency, 61 Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5EQ, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; Immunisations and Vaccine Preventable Diseases, UK Health Security Agency, 61 Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5EQ, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; Immunisations and Vaccine Preventable Diseases, UK Health Security Agency, 61 Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5EQ, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Hershel Smith Building Cambridge Biomedical Campus, CB2 0SZ, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, NW1 2PG, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, De'Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University College London, WC1E 6BT, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.; Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University College London, WC1E 6BT, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Previous studies suggested an association between small fibre neuropathy and pain in long-COVID cases. In this case-control study, our aim was to identify small fibre neuropathy in patients experiencing painful long-COVID syndrome. Clinical data, quantitative sensory testing, and skin biopsies were collected from 26 selected patients with painful long-COVID syndrome. We also examined 100 individuals with past COVID-19 infection, selecting 33 patients with painless long-COVID syndrome, characterized mainly by symptoms such as brain fog and fatigue, and 30 asymptomatic post-COVID-19 controls. Demographic and clinical variables were compared among these groups. Among the 26 patients with painful long-COVID syndrome, 12 had skin biopsy and/or quantitative sensory testing abnormalities compatible with small fibre neuropathy. Demographic and clinical data did not differ across patients with small fibre neuropathy, patients with painless long-COVID syndrome, and asymptomatic post-COVID-19 controls. This case-control study showed that approximately 50% of patients experiencing painful long-COVID syndrome had small fibre neuropathy. However, in our patient cohort, this specific post-COVID-19 complication was unrelated to demographic and COVID-19 clinical variables. Approximately half of our sample of patients with painful long-COVID symptoms met diagnostic criteria for small fibre neuropathy.","2024","2024 Sep 01","Pietro Falco; Daniel Litewczuk; Giulia Di Stefano; Eleonora Galosi; Caterina Leone; Gianfranco De Stefano; Giuseppe Di Pietro; Lorenzo Tramontana; Maria Rosa Ciardi; Patrizia Pasculli; Maria Antonella Zingaropoli; Lars Arendt-Nielsen; Andrea Truini","Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.; Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.; Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.; Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.; Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.; Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.; Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.; Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.; Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.; Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.; Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.; Centre for Neuroplasticity and Pain, SMI, School of Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mech-Sense, Clinical Institute, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.; Steno Diabetes Center North Denmark, Clinical Institute, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.; Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy."

Difficulties with cognition including memory impairments, attentional issues, and cloudiness are commonly described. The current medical literature demonstrates a similar cloudiness: there is no clear taxonomy or nomenclature, no well-validated evaluations and a dearth of effective interventions. To focus our understanding of this complex phenomenon, we will perform a discourse analysis to explore how brain fog is described in public posts on social media. Discursive methodology will generate insights regarding the societal understanding and meanings attributed to brain fog, by sampling perspectives of persons with lived experience, currently underrepresented in the medical literature. It is anticipated that the results of the proposed study will 1) help healthcare professionals better understand the experience of chronic pain-related brain fog and 2) generate hypotheses for future research. To conclude, by incorporating innovative and contemporary methods, this proposed discourse analysis of social media sources will generate nuanced insights, bridging the gap between researchers, health care providers, and persons with lived experience.","2024","2024","Ronessa Dass; Tara Packham","Rehabilitation Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.; Rehabilitation Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."

A significant portion of these infections will lead to long COVID (post-COVID-19 condition) and its attendant morbidities and costs. Numerous life-altering complications have already been associated with the development of long COVID, including chronic fatigue, brain fog, and dangerous heart rhythms. We aim to derive an actionable long COVID case definition consisting of significantly increased signs, symptoms, and diagnoses to support pandemic-related clinical, public health, research, and policy initiatives. This research employs a case-crossover population-based study using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) data generated at Veterans Affairs medical centers nationwide between January 1, 2020, and August 18, 2022. In total, 367,148 individuals with ICD-10-CM data both before and after a positive COVID-19 test were selected for analysis. We compared ICD-10-CM codes assigned 1 to 7 months following each patient's positive test with those assigned up to 6 months prior. Further, 350,315 patients had novel codes assigned during this window of time. We defined signs, symptoms, and diagnoses as being associated with long COVID if they had a novel case frequency of ≥1:1000, and they significantly increased in our entire cohort after a positive test. We present odds ratios with CIs for long COVID signs, symptoms, and diagnoses, organized by ICD-10-CM functional groups and medical specialty. We used our definition to assess long COVID risk based on a patient's demographics, Elixhauser score, vaccination status, and COVID-19 disease severity. We developed a long COVID definition consisting of 323 ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes grouped into 143 ICD-10-CM functional groups that were significantly increased in our 367,148 patient post-COVID-19 population. We defined 17 medical-specialty long COVID subtypes such as cardiology long COVID. Patients who were COVID-19-positive developed signs, symptoms, or diagnoses included in our long COVID definition at a proportion of at least 59.7% (268,320/449,450, based on a denominator of all patients who were COVID-19-positive). The long COVID cohort was 8 years older with more comorbidities (2-year Elixhauser score 7.97 in the patients with long COVID vs 4.21 in the patients with non-long COVID). Patients who had a more severe bout of COVID-19, as judged by their minimum oxygen saturation level, were also more likely to develop long COVID. An actionable, data-driven definition of long COVID can help clinicians screen for and diagnose long COVID, allowing identified patients to be admitted into appropriate monitoring and treatment programs. This long COVID definition can also support public health, research, and policy initiatives. Patients with COVID-19 who are older or have low oxygen saturation levels during their bout of COVID-19, or those who have multiple comorbidities should be preferentially watched for the development of long COVID.","2024","2024 Apr 30","Skyler Resendez; Steven H Brown; Hugo Sebastian Ruiz Ayala; Prahalad Rangan; Jonathan Nebeker; Diane Montella; Peter L Elkin","Department of Biomedical Informatics, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, United States.; Office of Health Informatics, Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, DC, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, United States.; Office of Health Informatics, Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, DC, United States.; Office of Health Informatics, Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, DC, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, United States.; Office of Health Informatics, Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, DC, United States."

The mechanisms regulating the development of PASC are currently not known; however, hypotheses include virus reservoirs, pre-existing conditions, microblood clots, immune dysregulation, as well as poor antibody responses. Importantly, virus neutralizing antibodies are essential for COVID-19 recovery and protection from reinfection but there is currently limited information on these immune regulators and associated cytokines in PASC patients. Understanding the key drivers of general and specific symptoms associated with Long COVID and the presence of virus neutralizing antibodies in PASC will aid in the development of therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines which currently do not exist. We designed a cross-sectional study to investigate systemic antibody and cytokine responses during COVID-19 recovery and PASC. In total, 195 participants were recruited in one of four groups: (1) Those who never had COVID-19 (No COVID); (2) Those in acute COVID-19 recovery (Acute Recovery) (4-12 weeks post infection); (3) Those who recovered from COVID-19 (Recovered) (+ 12 weeks from infection); and (4) those who had PASC (PASC) (+ 12 weeks from infection). Participants completed a questionnaire on health history, sex, gender, demographics, experiences with COVID-19 acute and COVID-19 recovery/continuing symptoms. Serum samples collected were evaluated for antibody binding to viral proteins, virus neutralizing antibody titers, and serum cytokine levels using Ella SimplePlex Immunoassay™ panels. We found participants with PASC reported more pre-existing conditions (e.g. such as hypertension, asthma, and obesity), and PASC symptoms (e.g. fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and shortness of breath) following COVID-19 than COVID-19 Recovered individuals. Importantly, we found PASC individuals to have significantly decreased levels of neutralizing antibodies toward both SARS-CoV-2 and the Omicron BA.1 variant. Sex analysis indicated that female PASC study participants had sustained antibody levels as well as levels of the inflammatory cytokines GM-CSF and ANG-2 over time following COVID-19. Our study reports people experiencing PASC had lower levels of virus neutralizing antibodies; however, the results are limited by the collection time post-COVID-19 and post-vaccination. Moreover, we found females experiencing PASC had sustained levels of GM-CSF and ANG-2. With lower levels of virus neutralizing antibodies, this data suggests that PASC individuals not only have had a suboptimal antibody response during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection but may also have increased susceptibility to subsequent infections which may exacerbate or prolong current PASC illnesses. We also provide evidence suggesting GM-CSF and ANG-2 to play a role in the sex-bias of PASC. Taken together, our findings maybe important for understanding immune molecular drivers of PASC and PASC subgroups.","2024","2024 Apr 29","Ethan B Jansen; Ali Toloue Ostadgavahi; Benjamin Hewins; Rachelle Buchanan; Brittany M Thivierge; Gustavo Sganzerla Martinez; Una Goncin; Magen E Francis; Cynthia L Swan; Erin Scruten; Jack Bell; Joseph Darbellay; Antonio Facciuolo; Darryl Falzarano; Volker Gerdts; Mark E Fenton; Peter Hedlin; David J Kelvin; Alyson A Kelvin","Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Department of Veterinary Microbiology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Department of Veterinary Microbiology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Department of Veterinary Microbiology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Division of Respirology, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada. alyson.kelvin@usask.ca."

Methods: COVID-19 survivors completed an online survey that included the FACs, a measure of brain fog and central fatigue with 20 items rated on a digital-analog scale. Useable data from 559 participants were analyzed to test the two-factor structure of the FACs, test for measurement invariance by sex and device was used to complete the survey (hand-held, computer), and item correlations with symptoms of depression and anxiety were examined. Results: The two-factor structure of the FACs replicated, supporting the separate assessments of brain fog and fatigue, χ2(164) = 1028.363, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.934, TLI = 0.923, RMSEA = 0.097, SRMR = 0.053. The FACs exhibited invariance at the scalar level, indicating item and factor integrity regardless of sex and device type. Using a correlation > 0.70 as a criterion (i.e., indicating more than 50% shared variance between two items), items on the FACs (assessing fatigue and lack of energy) were highly correlated with feeling tired or having little energy on the depression measure. No other items correlated with any anxiety symptom larger than 0.70. Conclusions: The FACs appears to be a psychometrically sound and efficient measure for use with COVID-19 survivors, assessing symptoms of brain fog and central fatigue that are not attributable to symptoms assessed by established measures of depression and anxiety.","2024","2024 Apr 10","Yu-Yu Hsiao; Timothy R Elliott; Julie Jaramillo; Megan E Douglas; Mark B Powers; Ann Marie Warren","Department of Individual, Family and Community Education, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.; Department of Educational Psychology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA.; Department of Individual, Family and Community Education, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.; Baylor Scott & White Research Institute, Dallas, TX 75246, USA.; Baylor Scott & White Research Institute, Dallas, TX 75246, USA.; Baylor Scott & White Research Institute, Dallas, TX 75246, USA."

However, limited studies have evaluated the impact of telehealth by analyzing the physical and/or mental health data of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis collected through telehealth targeting Korean population. This study aimed to identify subgroup of depressive symptom trajectories in patients with clinically mild COVID-19 using collected longitudinal data from a telehealth-based contactless clinical trial. A total of 199 patients with COVID-19 were accrued for contactless clinical trial using telehealth from March 23 to July 20, 2022. Depressive symptoms were measured using the patient health questionnaire-9 on the start day of quarantine, on the final day of quarantine, and 1 month after release from quarantine. Additionally, acute COVID-19 symptoms were assessed every day during quarantine. This study used a latent class mixed model to differentiate subgroups of depressive symptom trajectories and a logistic regression model with Firth's correction to identify associations between acute COVID-19 symptoms and the subgroups. Two latent classes were identified: class 1 with declining linearity at a slow rate and class 2 with increasing linearity. Among COVID-19 symptoms, fever, chest pain, and brain fog 1 month after release from quarantine showed strong associations with class 2 (fever: OR, 19.43, 95% CI, 2.30-165.42; chest pain: OR, 6.55, 95% CI, 1.15-34.61; brain fog: OR, 7.03, 95% CI 2.57-20.95).

Low levels of PTH result in hypocalcemia, which is often treated with calcium supplementation and active vitamin-D analogs. However, increasing evidence suggests that HypoPT has a profound impact on several organ systems. Quality of life (QOL) is reduced in patients with HypoPT, partly due to symptoms related to the central nervous system-including subjective feelings of confusion, a reduced ability to focus and think clearly (ie, ""brain fog""). However, the extent to which these complex symptoms relate to quantifiable changes in patients' cognitive performance as determined by neuropsychological tests remains unclear. The brains of HypoPT patients may reveal tissue calcifications, but the extent to which long-term brain exposure to low PTH levels and/or changing calcium levels affects brain structure is unknown. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated PTH levels, QOL, cognitive impairment, and brain structure in well-treated post-surgical and non-surgical hypoparathyroid patients compared with healthy controls. QOL was quantified by the SF36v2, WHO-5 wellbeing Index, and two disease-specific questionnaires-the HPQ28 and Hypoparathyroidism Symptom Diary. Cognitive functions were tested using comprehensive neuropsychological. Brain structure was quantified by morphological analyses of magnetic resonance imaging images. We found reduced QOL and cognitive functioning in terms of processing speed, executive functions, visual memory, and auditory memory in HypoPT. Furthermore, HypoPT revealed a reduced volume of the hippocampus-and the size of the thalamus in postsurgical patients was associated with the disease duration. Importantly, patients reporting severe brain fog had a smaller hippocampus than those with less brainfog. HypoPT is associated with quantifiable cognitive deficits and changes in brain structure that align with patient symptoms. Our exploratory study warrants further studies of the neurobiological impact of PTH and of the impact of PTH replacements therapy on patients' cognitive functioning.","2024","2024 Aug 05","Tanja Sikjaer; Simon Fristed Eskildsen; Line Underbjerg; Leif Østergaard; Lars Rejnmark; Lars Evald","Department of Internal Medicine, Horsens Regional Hospital, 8700 Horsens, Denmark.; Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, 8000 Aarhus, Denmark.; Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience (CFIN), Aarhus University  8000 Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, 8000 Aarhus, Denmark.; Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience (CFIN), Aarhus University  8000 Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, 8000 Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Neuroradiology, Aarhus University Hospital, 8000 Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, 8000 Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, 8000 Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, 8000 Aarhus, Denmark.; Hammel Neurorehabilitation Centre and University Research Clinic, 8450 Hammel, Denmark."

It causes cognitive problems, mostly short-term memory disturbances, attention impairments, and problems with concentration. Although trials for treatment methods for brain fog have been carried out worldwide, effective methods have not yet been reported. Neurofeedback is effective for several common disorders and symptoms, including anxiety, depression, headaches, and pain. Neurofeedback is also reported to improve cognitive functions, such as processing speed and executive functions, including attention, planning, organization, problem-solving, and performance. Furthermore, neurofeedback is effective for ""chemofog"" and ""chemobrain,"" which occur after chemotherapy and cause cognitive impairments in a similar manner to brain fog. However, there have been no reports of neurofeedback treatments for brain fog. Therefore, we have started to develop an original neurofeedback treatment method for brain fog using a Z-score neurofeedback technique. In this study, we present the first case report of a patient who has successfully recovered from brain fog via neurofeedback. Pain and psychological assessments revealed that the patient's pain improved and that the patient recovered from anxiety. Electroencephalograph data revealed several noble findings. C4 was thought to be the most affected site by brain fog, and this improved after treatment. The percentage increase at alpha wavelengths increased at almost all sites, and beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, and Hi beta decreased at almost all sites. The increased values at theta and alpha wavelengths after the 1st and 2nd sessions and the decreased values at higher beta wavelengths, such as beta 3 and Hi beta, were shown at all sessions.","2024","2024 Mar","Tatsuya Masuko; Harue Sasai-Masuko","Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Emerald Orthopedic & Pain Clinic, Sapporo, JPN.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Emerald Orthopedic & Pain Clinic, Sapporo, JPN."

We investigated the susceptibility and impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among persons with premorbid neurological disorders, in addition to the post-infection incidence of neurological sequelae, in a case-control population-based cohort. Using health service data collected between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021, we constructed a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive (n = 177 892) and -negative (n = 177 800) adults who were age, sex and comorbidity matched and underwent RT-PCR testing at similar times. COVID-19-associated mortality rates were examined within the cohort. Neurological sequelae were analysed during the acute (<3 months) and the post-acute (3-9 months) phases post-infection. The risk of death was significantly greater in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive (2140 per 100 000 person years) compared with RNA-negative (922 per 100 000 person years) over a follow-up of 9 months, particularly amongst those with premorbid neurological disorders: adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) in persons with a prior history of parkinsonism, 1.65 (1.15-2.37); dementia, 1.30 (1.11-1.52); seizures, 1.91 (1.26-2.87); encephalopathy, 1.82 (1.02-3.23); and stroke, 1.74 (1.05-2.86). There was also a significantly increased risk for diagnosis of new neurological sequelae during the acute time phase after COVID-19, including encephalopathy, 2.0 (1.10-3.64); dementia, 1.36 (1.07-1.73); seizure, 1.77 (1.22-2.56); and brain fog, 1.96 (1.20-3.20). These risks persisted into the post-acute phase after COVID-19, during which inflammatory myopathy (2.57, 1.07-6.15) and coma (1.87, 1.22-2.87) also became significantly increased. Thus, persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection and premorbid neurological disorders are at greater risk of death, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was complicated by increased risk of new-onset neurological disorders in both the acute and post-acute phases of COVID-19.","2024","2024 Jul 05","Candace M Marsters; Jeffrey A Bakal; Grace Y Lam; Finlay A McAlister; Christopher Power","Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2B7, Canada.; Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2B7, Canada.; Provincial Research Data Services-Alberta Health Services, Edmonton, AB T6G 2B7, Canada.; Alberta Strategy for Patient Oriented Research Unit, Edmonton, AB T6G 2C8, Canada.; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2B7, Canada.; Alberta Strategy for Patient Oriented Research Unit, Edmonton, AB T6G 2C8, Canada.; Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2B7, Canada."

This research explores the prevalence, associated factors, and overall health outcomes of long COVID during a period of extensive vaccination and antiviral treatment availability in Thailand. Materials and Methods: This observational study involved 390 adult patients with COVID-19 between January and March 2022. Beginning three months after their diagnosis, these patients were interviewed via telephone every three months for a period of one year. The data collection process included gathering demographic information and administering a standardized questionnaire that addressed the patients' physical condition following COVID-19, their mental health, sleep disturbances, and overall quality of life. Results: The cohort consisted of 390 participants, with an average age of 31.8 ± 13.6. Among them, 96.7% (n = 377) were vaccinated, and 98.2% (n = 383) underwent antiviral treatment. Long-COVID prevalence was observed at 77.7%, with the most frequently reported symptoms being fatigue (64.1%) and cough (43.9%). Regarding mental health, depression was reported by 8.2% of the participants, anxiety by 4.1%, and poor sleep quality by 33.3%. Advanced statistical analysis using multivariable logistic regression showed significant links between long-COVID symptoms and patients aged below 60 (p = 0.042), as well as the initial symptom of cough (p = 0.045). In the subset of long-COVID sufferers, there was a notable correlation in females with symptoms such as headaches (p = 0.001), dizziness (p = 0.007), and brain fog (p = 0.013). Conclusions: Despite the extensive distribution of vaccines and antiviral therapies, the prevalence of long COVID remains high, being associated particularly with individuals under 60 and those exhibiting a cough as an early symptom. The study further reveals that mental health issues related to long COVID are profound, going beyond the scope of physical symptomatology.","2024","2024 Feb 21","Ramida Jangnin; Worraya Ritruangroj; Sirada Kittisupkajorn; Pattarapa Sukeiam; Juthamas Inchai; Benchalak Maneeton; Narong Maneetorn; Jindarat Chaiard; Theerakorn Theerakittikul","Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.; Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.; Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.; Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.; Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Allergy, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.; Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.; Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.; Faculty of Nursing, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.; Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Allergy, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.; Sleep Disorder Center, Center for Medical Excellence, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand."

Participants responded to the item ""Many women report just not feeling like themselves during this phase of life. How often was this true for you over the past 3 months?"" choosing from ""none of the time"" to ""all of the time."" They rated bother associated with 61 symptoms and provided demographic information. Individual symptoms and the symptom bother scale scores were correlated with NFLM. Symptom scale scores were then entered in a two-stage multiple regression model to identify symptoms associated significantly with NFLM. Sixty-three percent (63.3%) of participants reported NFLM 50% of the time or more over the previous 3 months. Individual symptom ratings correlated with NFLM ( r > 0.300) included the following: fatigue ( r = 0.491); feeling overwhelmed/less able to cope ( r = 0.463); low feelings ( r = 0.440); anxiety, more nervousness ( r = 0.398); being irritable ( r = 0.380); harder time concentrating ( r = 0.378); difficulty making decisions ( r = 0.357); feeling like ""I can't calm down on the inside"" ( r = 0.333); being more forgetful ( r = 0.332); tearfulness/crying ( r = 0.306); and worrying more ( r = 0.302).

The QoL-W was assessed with a 4-point Likert scale where 0, 1, 2, and 3 meant no, mild, moderate, and severe impairment in performing activities at work, respectively. Data on age, sex, comorbidities, and laboratory results (including first in-hospital high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I [hs-cTnI] measurement) were gathered. The study included 181 hospitalized subjects (age Me = 57 years), 37.02% women. Most had low disease severity (Modified Early Warning Score = 1, 77.90%) and low comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index 0: 28.72%, 1-2: 34.09%), with no intensive care unit treatment needed.

First in-hospital hs-cTnI levels were 47.3% higher in participants who later presented with brain fog at median follow-up of 26.7 weeks since the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals who experienced at least one brain fog symptom at follow-up, had elevated hs-cTnI, less often presented with atrial fibrillation, and used anticoagulants during initial hospitalization due to COVID-19. The Hs-cTnI >11.90 ng/l predicted brain fog symptoms in multivariable model. COVID-19 was associated with 3.6‑fold, 3.0‑fold, and 2.4-fold QoL-W deterioration within 4, 4-12, and >12 weeks post-infection (p < 0.05). Subjects with QoL-W decline >12 weeks were younger, mostly women, had more brain fog symptoms, and higher platelet counts. Multivariable models with self-reported brain fog symptoms (responding coherently and recalling recent information), age, and sex exhibited good discriminatory power for QoL-W impairment (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.846, 95% CI: 0.780-0.912). This study highlighted that in non-high-risk subjects hospitalized during the first 2 pandemic's waves: 1) brain fog was common, affecting nearly half of individuals, and impacting QoL-W >12 weeks after initial infection, 2) after 3 months of COVID-19 onset, the decline in QoL-W was primarily attributed to brain fog symptoms rather than demographic factors, health conditions, admission status, and laboratory findings, 3) components of brain fog, such as answering in an understandable way or recalling new information increased the likelihood of significantly lower QoL-W up to tenfold, 4) biochemical indicators, such as the first hs-cTnI level, might predict the risk of experiencing brain fog symptoms and indirectly decreased QoL-W >12 weeks after COVID-19 onset. Occupational medicine practitioners should pay particular attention to younger and female subjects after COVID-19 complaining of problems with answering questions in understandable way or recalling new information as they have an increased risk of QoL-W impairment.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that in those post-COVID persons, abnormal rsEEG rhythms may occur even when cognitive and psychiatric disorders are absent. The experiments were performed on post-COVID participants about one year after hospitalization for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Inclusion criteria included a ""brain fog"" claim, no pre-infection, and actual organic chronic disease. Matched controls (no COVID) were also enrolled. All participants underwent clinical/neuropsychological assessment (including fatigue assessment) and rsEEG recordings. The eLORETA freeware estimated regional rsEEG cortical sources at individual delta (<4 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), and alpha (8-13 Hz) bands. Beta (14-30 Hz) and gamma (30-40 Hz) bands were pre-fixed. More than 90% of all post-COVID participants showed no cognitive or psychiatric disorders, and 75% showed ≥ 2 fatigue symptoms. The post-COVID group globally presented lower posterior rsEEG alpha source activities than the Control group. This effect was more significant in the long COVID-19 patients with ≥ 2 fatigue symptoms. In post-COVID patients with no chronic diseases and cognitive/psychiatric disorders, ""brain fog"" can be associated with abnormal posterior rsEEG alpha rhythms and subjective fatigue. These abnormalities may be related to vigilance and allostatic dysfunctions.","2024","2024 May","Claudio Babiloni; Elio Gentilini Cacciola; Federico Tucci; Paolo Vassalini; Agnese Chilovi; Dharmendra Jakhar; Andreea Maria Musat; Marco Salvatore; Andrea Soricelli; Fabrizio Stocchi; Laura Vacca; Raffaele Ferri; Valentina Catania; Claudio Mastroianni; Gabriella D'Ettorre; Giuseppe Noce","Department of Physiology and Pharmacology ""Erspamer,"" Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy; Hospital San Raffaele Cassino, Cassino, FR, Italy.

A standardised tool to define and assess it is an important unmet need. To develop a patient-informed tool to assess brain fog in coeliac disease to support clinical care, research and drug development. A pilot online study defined patient descriptors of brain fog. A second study evaluated the factor structure and performance of the scale across two-time points ('Now' and in the 'Past week'). One month later, participants were invited to repeat the study with two online cognitive processing tests, the Stroop task and the trail making test. Among adults with treated coeliac disease, 37 (91.9% F) participated in the pilot study and 510 (88.8% F) in the second study of whom 99 repeated the study 1 month later with 51 completing cognitive testing. The most common brain fog descriptors were 'difficulty focusing', 'difficulty thinking' and 'difficulty finding the right words and communicating'. The 12-item scale reflects 'cognitive impairment' and 'somatic and affective experience' and demonstrates strong psychometric properties. It tracked with patients report of brain fog being present or absent across two-time points. It did not significantly correlate with the cognitive tests. The brain fog assessment and severity scale is the first patient-informed clinical outcomes assessment tool measuring brain fog in coeliac disease. It is brief and validated for two time-based formats. Further research coupling it with biomarker discovery is needed to confirm its validity as a predictor of cognitive performance.","2024","2024 May","Simon R Knowles; Pragalathan Apputhurai; Jason A Tye-Din","Department of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Health, Arts and Design, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Health Sciences and Biostatistics, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia.; Immunology Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Gastroenterology, the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia."

Symptoms include exertion fatigue, respiratory issues, myalgia, and neurological manifestations such as 'brain fog,' posing concern for their debilitating nature and potential role in other neurological disorders. However, the underlying potential pathogenic mechanisms of the neurological complications of PASC is largely unknown. Herein, we investigated differences in antigen-specific T cell responses from the peripheral blood towards SARS-CoV-2, latent viruses, or neuronal antigens in 14 PASC individuals with neurological manifestations (PASC-N) versus 22 individuals fully recovered from COVID-19. We employed Activation Induced Marker (AIM), ICS and FluoroSpot assays to determine the specificity and magnitude of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses towards SARS-CoV-2 (Spike and rest of proteome), latent viruses (CMV, EBV), and several neuronal antigens. Overall, we observed similar antigen-specific T cell frequencies and cytokine effector T cell responses between PASC donors compared to recovered controls for all antigens tested (viral or autoantigen) in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments. Our findings suggest that PASC-N does not appear to be associated with changes in antigen-specific T cell responses towards a subset of disease-relevant targets, but more studies in a larger cohort are needed to confirm these unaltered responses.","2024","2024 May","Gregory P Williams; Esther Dawen Yu; Kendra Shapiro; Eric Wang; Antoine Freuchet; April Frazier; Cecilia S Lindestam Arlehamn; Alessandro Sette; Ricardo da Silva Antunes","Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA.; Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA.; Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA.; Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA.; Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA.; Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA.; Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA.; Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA; University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA.; Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA.

Whether objectively measurable cognitive deficits exist and how long they persist are unclear. We invited 800,000 adults in a study in England to complete an online assessment of cognitive function. We estimated a global cognitive score across eight tasks. We hypothesized that participants with persistent symptoms (lasting ≥12 weeks) after infection onset would have objectively measurable global cognitive deficits and that impairments in executive functioning and memory would be observed in such participants, especially in those who reported recent poor memory or difficulty thinking or concentrating (""brain fog""). Of the 141,583 participants who started the online cognitive assessment, 112,964 completed it. In a multiple regression analysis, participants who had recovered from Covid-19 in whom symptoms had resolved in less than 4 weeks or at least 12 weeks had similar small deficits in global cognition as compared with those in the no-Covid-19 group, who had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or had unconfirmed infection (-0.23 SD [95% confidence interval {CI}, -0.33 to -0.13] and -0.24 SD [95% CI, -0.36 to -0.12], respectively); larger deficits as compared with the no-Covid-19 group were seen in participants with unresolved persistent symptoms (-0.42 SD; 95% CI, -0.53 to -0.31). Larger deficits were seen in participants who had SARS-CoV-2 infection during periods in which the original virus or the B.1.1.7 variant was predominant than in those infected with later variants (e.g., -0.17 SD for the B.1.1.7 variant vs. the B.1.1.529 variant; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.13) and in participants who had been hospitalized than in those who had not been hospitalized (e.g., intensive care unit admission, -0.35 SD; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.20). Results of the analyses were similar to those of propensity-score-matching analyses. In a comparison of the group that had unresolved persistent symptoms with the no-Covid-19 group, memory, reasoning, and executive function tasks were associated with the largest deficits (-0.33 to -0.20 SD); these tasks correlated weakly with recent symptoms, including poor memory and brain fog. No adverse events were reported. Participants with resolved persistent symptoms after Covid-19 had objectively measured cognitive function similar to that in participants with shorter-duration symptoms, although short-duration Covid-19 was still associated with small cognitive deficits after recovery. Longer-term persistence of cognitive deficits and any clinical implications remain uncertain.

To test the hypothesis that Type 1 (classical inflammatory lupus) activity is associated with Type 2 SLE activity, we characterized the features of Type 2 SLE in patients with a range of lupus nephritis (LN) activity. This was a cross-sectional study of SLE patients [American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1997 or Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) 2012 classification criteria] from June 2018 to March 2020. Patients completed the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ) and the Polysymptomatic Distress Scale. Patients were divided into groups based on their renal status. Active nephritis was defined using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) lupus nephritis parameter. Differences across groups were analyzed by Fisher's exact test and ANOVA. In this cohort of 244 patients (93% female, mean age 43 years, 58% Black), 10% had active nephritis, 35% had historical nephritis, and 55% never had nephritis (non-nephritis). Active nephritis and non-nephritis patients had a similar burden of Type 2 SLE symptoms, despite a difference in Type 1 SLE activity. Patients with active nephritis had higher Type 2 PGA (Physician Global Assessment) scores and reported more Type 2 SLE symptoms than inactive nephritis patients. Patients with inactive nephritis had the lowest Type 2 SLE activity. While Type 2 SLE symptoms are common in SLE, our findings suggest that patients with active nephritis experience significant Type 2 SLE symptoms that may be ameliorated as nephritis improves. We also observed that non-nephritis patients had a similar burden of Type 2 SLE symptoms as patients with active nephritis, despite having on average lower Type 1 SLE activity. Therefore, the etiology of Type 2 SLE symptoms is likely multifactorial and may be driven by inflammatory and non-inflammatory biopsychosocial factors.

Here we show that BBB disruption is evident during acute infection and in patients with long COVID with cognitive impairment, commonly referred to as brain fog. Using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, we show BBB disruption in patients with long COVID-associated brain fog. Transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed dysregulation of the coagulation system and a dampened adaptive immune response in individuals with brain fog. Accordingly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed increased adhesion to human brain endothelial cells in vitro, while exposure of brain endothelial cells to serum from patients with long COVID induced expression of inflammatory markers. Together, our data suggest that sustained systemic inflammation and persistent localized BBB dysfunction is a key feature of long COVID-associated brain fog.","2024","2024 Mar","Chris Greene; Ruairi Connolly; Declan Brennan; Aoife Laffan; Eoin O'Keeffe; Lilia Zaporojan; Jeffrey O'Callaghan; Bennett Thomson; Emma Connolly; Ruth Argue; James F M Meaney; Ignacio Martin-Loeches; Aideen Long; Cliona Ni Cheallaigh; Niall Conlon; Colin P Doherty; Matthew Campbell","Smurfit Institute of Genetics, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Neurology, Health Care Centre, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Neurology, Health Care Centre, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Neurology, Health Care Centre, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.; Smurfit Institute of Genetics, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Neurology, Health Care Centre, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.; Smurfit Institute of Genetics, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.; Smurfit Institute of Genetics, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.; The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.; Clinical Research Facility, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.; Thomas Mitchell Centre for Advanced Medical Imaging (CAMI), St. James's Hospital & Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Multidisciplinary Intensive Care Research Organization, Trinity Centre for Health Sciences, St James's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.; Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.; Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Immunology, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Immunology, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.; St James's Hospital, Tallaght University Hospital, Trinity College Dublin Allied Researchers (STTAR) Bioresource, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Neurology, Health Care Centre, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. cdohert@tcd.ie.; Academic Unit of Neurology, Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland. cdohert@tcd.ie.; FutureNeuro, Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Chronic and Rare Neurological Diseases, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dublin, Ireland. cdohert@tcd.ie.; Smurfit Institute of Genetics, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland. matthew.campbell@tcd.ie.; FutureNeuro, Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Chronic and Rare Neurological Diseases, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dublin, Ireland. matthew.campbell@tcd.ie."

To comprehensively grasp the extent of these issues, we conducted a study integrating traditional neuropsychological assessments with experimental cognitive tasks targeting attention control, working memory, and long-term memory, three cognitive domains most commonly associated with 'brain fog'. We enrolled 33 post-COVID patients, all self-reporting cognitive difficulties, and a matched control group (N = 27) for cognitive and psychological assessments. Our findings revealed significant attention deficits in post-COVID patients across both neuropsychological measurements and experimental cognitive tasks, evidencing reduced performance in tasks involving interference resolution and selective and sustained attention. Mild executive function and naming impairments also emerged from the neuropsychological assessment. Notably, 61% of patients reported significant prospective memory failures in daily life, aligning with our recruitment focus. Furthermore, our patient group showed significant alterations in the psycho-affective domain, indicating a complex interplay between cognitive and psychological factors, which could point to a non-cognitive determinant of subjectively experienced cognitive changes following COVID-19. In summary, our study offers valuable insights into attention challenges faced by individuals recovering from COVID-19, stressing the importance of comprehensive cognitive and psycho-affective evaluations for supporting post-COVID individuals.","2024","2024 Feb 22","Sandra Arbula; Elisabetta Pisanu; Giulia Bellavita; Alina Menichelli; Alberta Lunardelli; Giovanni Furlanis; Paolo Manganotti; Stefano Cappa; Raffaella Rumiati","Neuroscience Area, International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA), Via Bonomea 265, 34136, Trieste, Italy. saarbul@sissa.it.; Neuroscience Area, International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA), Via Bonomea 265, 34136, Trieste, Italy.; Neurology Unit, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, Trieste University Hospital ASUGI, Trieste, Italy.; Rehabilitation Unit, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, Trieste University Hospital ASUGI, Trieste, Italy.; Rehabilitation Unit, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, Trieste University Hospital ASUGI, Trieste, Italy.; Neurology Unit, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, Trieste University Hospital ASUGI, Trieste, Italy.; Neurology Unit, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, Trieste University Hospital ASUGI, Trieste, Italy.; Scuola Universitaria Superiore IUSS, Pavia, Italy.; IRCCS Mondino Foundation, Pavia, Italy.; Neuroscience Area, International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA), Via Bonomea 265, 34136, Trieste, Italy.; Università Degli Studi di Roma ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy."

There are non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, and brain fog, which cannot be ascribed to a single system. PASC places a notable strain on our healthcare system, which is already laden with a large number of acute-COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, it impedes social, academic and vocational functioning, and impacts family life, relationships, and work/financial life. The treatment for PASC needs to target this non-specific etiology and wide-ranging sequelae. In conditions similar to PASC, such as ""chemo brain,"" and prolonged symptoms of concussion, the non-specific symptoms have shown to be effectively managed through education and strategies for self-management and Mindfulness interventions. However, such interventions have yet to be empirically evaluated in PASC to our knowledge. In response to this gap, we have developed a virtual education intervention synthesized by psychiatrists and clinical psychologists for the current study. We will undertake a two-phase randomized controlled trial to determine the feasibility (Phase 1; N = 90) and efficacy (Phase 2; sample sized based on phase 1 results) of the novel 8 week Education and Self-Management Strategies group compared to a mindfulness skills program, both delivered virtually. Main outcomes include confidence/ability to self-manage symptoms, quality of life, and healthcare utilization. This study stands to mitigate the deleterious intrusiveness of symptoms on everyday life in patients with PASC, and may also help to reduce the impact of PASC on the healthcare system.

It is typically characterized by fatigue, cognitive problems and psychiatric symptoms, as well as cardiac symptoms that contribute to exercise intolerance in many. Despite the high prevalence of PCC among those with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is currently no widely accepted rehabilitation strategy, and many conventional modalities are movement-based. Non-invasive brain stimulation methods such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may have some potential to alleviate the cognitive and affective symptoms of PCC without reliance on exercise. The purpose of the present study was to explore the feasibility and tolerability of using rTMS to treat symptoms of ""brain fog"" and affective disturbance among those living with PCC, using a case series design. We enrolled four individuals with PCC following a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least 3 months after the resolution of the primary infection. Participants were randomized to 4 sessions of active and 2 sessions of sham intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS); two intensities of iTBS were evaluated: iTBS-300 and iTBS-600. No adverse events occurred in active or sham stimulation; 2 participants reported tingling sensation on the scalp but no other tolerability issues. Trends in symptoms suggested improvements in cognitive interference, quality of life, and anxiety in the majority of participants. In summary, in this case series iTBS was well tolerated among 4 individuals with PCC; active stimulation was associated with positive trends in some primary symptom clusters as compared with sham stimulation. Future studies should examine the effects of iTBS on PCC symptoms in the context of experimental studies and randomized controlled trials.","2024","2024 Mar","Mohammad Nazmus Sakib; Ashish Saragadam; Mariella C Santagata; Marie Jolicoeur-Becotte; Lena Kozyr; Amer M Burhan; Peter A Hall","School of Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Health, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.; School of Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Health, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.; School of Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Health, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.; School of Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Health, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.; School of Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Health, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.; Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences, Whitby, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.; School of Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Health, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.; Centre for Bioengineering and Biotechnology, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada."

We sought to determine the impact of sleep disruption on cognition and quality of life in patients with neurologic manifestations of PASC (Neuro-PASC). Thirty-nine patients were recruited from Neuro-COVID-19 clinic. Mean age was 48.1 years, 71.8% were female, and 82% were never hospitalized for COVID-19. Patients were evaluated via clinical assessment, quality-of-life measures in domains of cognitive function, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression, NIH Toolbox cognitive tests, and 7 days of wrist actigraphy. The median number of neurologic symptoms attributed to PASC was 6, with brain fog being the most common in 89.7%. Regarding non-neurologic symptoms, 94.9% complained of fatigue and 74.4% of insomnia. Patients reported significant impairment in all quality-of-life domains and performed worse in a task of attention compared to a normative US population. Actigraphy showed Neuro-PASC patients had lower sleep efficiency, longer sleep latency (both p < 0.001), and later sleep midpoint (p = 0.039) compared to 71 age-matched healthy controls with no PASC history. Self-reported cognitive symptoms correlated with the severity of fatigue (p < 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.05), and depression (p < 0.01). Objective evidence of sleep disruption measured by wakefulness after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and latency were associated with decreased performance in attention and processing speed.

Based upon observations that: i) patients and their families frequently report that stressful life events either trigger exacerbations of existing symptoms or the onset of new symptoms, ii) psychological states and stress hormones influence mitochondrial energy production capacity, and iii) epidemiological reports document a robust connection between traumatic/stressful life events and various neurologic disorders, we hypothesized that mitochondrial disease symptom severity may vary according to participant's mood. To investigate this we administered the Stress, Health and Emotion Survey (SHES) in 70 adults (majority white (84%) cisgender women (83%), ages 18-74) with self-reported mitochondrial diseases (MELAS, 18%; CPEO, 17%; Complex I deficiency, 13%). Participants rated the severity of each of their symptom(s) over the past year on either good or bad days. On days marked by more stress, sadness and other negative emotions, some but not all symptoms were reported to be worse, including fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, and fine motor coordination. By contrast, on days marked by happiness and calmness, participants reported these and other symptoms to be better, or less severe. Other symptoms including diminished sweating, hearing problems, and dystonia were in general unrelated to mood. Thus, some individuals living with mitochondrial diseases, at times perceive a connection between their mood and symptom severity. These preliminary associative results constitute an initial step towards developing more comprehensive models of the factors that influence the clinical course of mitochondrial diseases.","2024","2024 Feb 04","Catherine Kelly; Alex Junker; Kris Englestad; Michio Hirano; Caroline Trumpff; Martin Picard","Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.; Department of Neurology, H.

Approximately 71% of individuals with long COVID experience ongoing fatigue, postexertional malaise, and cognitive impairments, which share pathological similarities with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). This similarity has prompted studies to explore the characteristics of long COVID to gain a better understanding of ME/CFS. To gain insights, we investigated the clinical and laboratory characteristics of individuals with fatigue-dominant long COVID. We enrolled 100 subjects (36 males, 64 females) with long COVID who had a higher score than 60 in the modified Korean version of the Chalder Fatigue Scale (mKCFQ11) and higher than 5 in a fatigue-focused visual analogue scale. To investigate fatigue symptoms, the mKCFQ11, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, a visual analogue scale for fatigue and brain fog, along with the Short-Form survey, were employed. We also measured 3 cytokines and cortisol levels for immunological and endocrinological indicators. As a cross-sectional observational study, the data were collected at a single point in time. The mean scores on the measurements showed severe fatigue, and these scores were significantly correlated, with no differences based on sex, the post-COVID period, or age. Among the laboratory tests, plasma cortisol levels had a significant negative correlation with fatigue scores and a positive correlation with living quality. The negative correlation between cortisol levels and mKCFQ11 scores appeared to be more specific to mental fatigue than physical, which conflicted with other measurements. Our findings provide the first insights into the characteristics of fatigue in individuals with long COVID, particularly in terms of fatigue severity and cortisol levels. These results serve as valuable reference data for clinicians dealing with fatigue symptoms in long-COVID patients and for researchers exploring postviral fatigue symptoms, including ME/CFS, in the future.","2025","2025 Feb","Jin-Seok Lee; Yujin Choi; Jin-Yong Joung; Chang-Gue Son","Institute of Bioscience & Integrative Medicine, Daejeon University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Korean Medicine, Korean Medical College of Daejeon University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.; Department of Internal Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Se-Myung University, Jecheon-si, Republic of Korea.; Department of Korean Medicine, Korean Medical College of Daejeon University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Internal Medicine, Daejeon Good-morning Oriental Hospital, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.; Department of Korean Medicine, Korean Medical College of Daejeon University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Internal Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Se-Myung University, Jecheon-si, Republic of Korea.

Here, we aimed to characterize the epidemiology of PASC in Mexico during 2022 and identify potential associations of covariates with PASC prevalence using nationally representative data. We analyzed data from the 2022 Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT) from 24,434 participants, representing 85,521,661 adults ≥20 years. PASC was defined using both the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) definition and a PASC score ≥12. Estimates of PASC prevalence were stratified by age, sex, rural vs. urban setting, social lag quartiles, number of reinfections, vaccination status and periods of predominance of SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants. Determinants of PASC were assessed using log-binomial regression models adjusted by survey weights. Persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported by 12.44% (95% CI 11.89-12.99) of adults ≥20 years in Mexico in 2022. The most common persistent symptoms were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, headache, cough, loss of smell or taste, fever, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, anxiety, and chest pain. PASC was present in 21.21% (95% CI 19.74-22.68) of subjects with previously diagnosed COVID-19. Over 28.6% of patients with PASC reported symptoms persistence ≥6 months and 14.05% reported incapacitating symptoms. Higher PASC prevalence was associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfections, depressive symptoms and living in states with high social lag. PASC prevalence, particularly its more severe forms, decreased with COVID-19 vaccination and for infections during periods of Omicron variant predominance. PASC remains a significant public health burden in Mexico as the COVID-19 pandemic transitions into endemic. Promoting SARS-CoV-2 reinfection prevention and booster vaccination may be useful in reducing PASC burden.

Whole-brain white matter and cortical gray matter health were assessed using multi-shell diffusion tensor imaging. Correlational tractography was utilized to dissect the nature and extent of white matter changes. In this study of 42 male essential workers, the most common symptoms of Neurological PASC (n = 24) included fatigue (n = 19) and headache (n = 17). Participants with neurological PASC demonstrated alterations to whole-brain white matter health when compared to controls made up of uninfected, asymptomatic, or mildly infected controls (n = 18). Large differences were evident between PASC and controls in measures of fractional anisotropy (Cohen's D=-0.54, P = 0.001) and cortical isotropic diffusion (Cohen's D = 0.50, P = 0.002). Symptoms were associated with white matter fractional anisotropy (fatigue: rho = -0.62, P< 0.001; headache: rho = -0.66, P < 0.001), as well as nine other measures of white and gray matter health. Brain fog was associated with improved cerebral functioning including improved white matter isotropic diffusion and quantitative anisotropy. This study identified changes across measures of white and gray matter connectivity, neuroinflammation, and cerebral atrophy that were interrelated and associated with differences in symptoms of PASC. These results provide insights into the long-term cerebral implications of COVID-19.","2024","2024 Jan 19","Sean Clouston; Chuan Huang; Jia Ying; Zennur Sekendiz; Minos Kritikos; Ashley Fontana; Lev Bangiyev; Benjamin Luft","Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook.; Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook.; Stony Brook University."

We conducted qualitative interviews with patients to identify the toxicities that are most relevant from their perspective, with the goal of creating a patient-reported companion measure to the Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index (GTI), a clinician-facing instrument. Thirty-one patients with recent or current GC use participated in concept elicitation interviews. Participants received GC treatment for myasthenia gravis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, vasculitis, or systemic lupus erythematosus. Transcripts were coded following a thematic analysis approach. Participants reported more than 100 toxicities they believed to be associated with their GC medications. Common toxicities included weight gain (87%), increased appetite (84%), insomnia/sleep problems (77%), cognitive impairment/brain fog (71%), easy bruising (68%), anxiety (65%), irritability/short temper (65%), and osteoporosis (39%). These toxicities often centered on self-esteem, neuropsychiatric effects, skin toxicities, and musculoskeletal function. They can be categorized into domains such emphasizing neuropsychiatric, metabolic/endocrine, musculoskeletal, and dermatological effects, highlighting aspects of GC toxicity that patients are uniquely positioned to appreciate and report. Our results confirm that the toxicities associated with GCs are pervasive and diverse, with substantial impact on patients' lives. These data will be used to inform the development of a patient-reported outcome measure assessing GC toxicity. This patient-reported instrument will be designed to complement the clinician-reported GTI, facilitating a more detailed understanding of the nuances of change in GC toxicity.","2024","2024 Mar 15","Timothy A Howell; Louis S Matza; John H Stone; Deborah Gelinas; Martha N Stone; Vijayaraghava T S Rao; Glenn A Phillips","Patient-Centered Research, Evidera, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Patient-Centered Research, Evidera, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

We performed a cross-sectional international, multicenter study on used PPCC definitions; the organization of PPCC care programs and patients characteristics. We compared aggregated data from PPCC cohorts and identified priorities to improve PPCC care. Ten PPCC care programs and six COVID-19 follow-up research cohorts participated. Aggregated data from 584 PPCC patients was analyzed. The most common symptoms included fatigue (71%), headache (55%), concentration difficulties (53%), and brain fog (48%). Severe limitations in daily life were reported in 31% of patients. Most PPCC care programs organized in-person visits with multidisciplinary teams. Diagnostic testing for respiratory and cardiac morbidity was most frequently performed and seldom abnormal. Treatment was often limited to physical therapy and psychological support. We found substantial heterogeneity in both the diagnostics and management of PPCC, possibly explained by scarce scientific evidence and lack of standardized care. We present a list of components which future guidelines should address, and outline priorities concerning PPCC care pathways, research and international collaboration. Pediatric Post-COVID Condition (PPCC) Care programs have been initiated in many countries. Children with PPCC in different countries are affected by similar symptoms, limiting many to participate in daily life. There is substantial heterogeneity in diagnostic testing.

This study aimed to investigate the frequency, characteristics, and clinical correlates of cognitive complaints (CC) in PASC, particularly in relation to objective neuropsychological (NP) performance. Seventy-four participants underwent psychiatric, medical, and NP testing approximately 7 months after acute COVID-19. The Patient Assessment of Own Functioning Inventory (PAOFI) was used to characterize the frequency and severity of CC in domains of memory, language, and cognitive/executive function. The associations of CC with sociodemographic, medical, psychiatric, and NP variables were assessed utilizing correlational analysis, logistic regression, and pairwise comparisons of those categorized as having CC vs. not having CC. Taken together, approximately one-third of the study participants had clinically significant CC. Memory difficulty was the most frequent CC, although all categories were frequently endorsed. Memory and cognitive/executive complaints correlated with NP tests in these and multiple other NP domains. CC were more likely to be under-reported in those with diminished NP performance than over-reported in those without diminished performance. Acute COVID-19 symptom severity, elevated depressive symptoms, and NP tests of diminished attention and psychomotor processing speed were independent predictors of CC in logistic regression. Cognitive complaints after acute COVID-19 should be taken seriously, as they are likely to reflect diminished NP performance, as well as medical, psychiatric, and functional burdens. However, patients with PASC may not accurately identify or characterize objective cognitive difficulties, so programs offering comprehensive care for patients with PASC should offer formal neuropsychological testing.","2023","2023 Dec 20","Cayla Muschel; Sean T Lynch; Rhea Dornbush; Lidia Klepacz; Sivan Shahar; Stephen J Ferrando","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Westchester Medical Center Health System, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Mount Sinai Beth Israel, New York, NY 10003, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Westchester Medical Center Health System, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Westchester Medical Center Health System, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY 10029, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Westchester Medical Center Health System, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA."

Out of all participants, 7.8% required hospitalization. The most prevalent symptoms during the acute infection (Mdn = 23.50 symptoms, IQR = 13-39) included fatigue, exhaustion, cough, brain fog, and memory problems. The median long-COVID disease duration was 12.10 months (IQR = 2.8-17.4). Among 64 inquired long-COVID symptoms (Mdn = 17.00 symptoms, IQR = 9-27), participants reported fatigue, exhaustion, memory problems, brain fog, and dyspnea as the most common ongoing symptoms, which were generally experienced as fluctuating and deteriorating after physical or cognitive activity. Common consequences of long-COVID included financial losses (40.5%), changes in the participants' profession (41.0%), stress resistance (87.5%), sexual life (38.1%), and mood (72.1%), as well as breathing difficulties (41.3%), or an increased drug intake (e.g., medicine, alcohol; 44.6%).

It is not known if Long-COVID affects patients' ability to form and retain procedural motor skill memories. The objective was to determine the ability of patients with Long-COVID to acquire and consolidate a new procedural motor skill over 2 training days. The primary outcome was to determine difference in early learning, measured as the increase in correct sequence typing speed over the initial 11 practice trials of a new skill. The secondary outcomes were initial and final typing speed on days 1 and 2, learning rate, overnight consolidation, and typing accuracy. In this prospective, cross-sectional, online, case-control study, participants learned a sequential motor skill over 2 consecutive days (NCT05746624). Patients with Long-COVID (reporting persistent post-coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] symptoms for more than 4 weeks) were recruited at the NIH. Patients were matched one-to-one by age and sex to controls recruited during the pandemic using a crowd-sourcing platform. Selection criteria included age 18-90 years, English speaking, right-handed, able to type with the left hand, denied active fever or respiratory infection, and no previous task exposure. Data were also compared with an age-matched and sex-matched control group who performed the task online before the COVID-19 pandemic (prepandemic controls). In total, 105 of 236 patients contacted agreed to participate and completed the experiment (mean ± SD age 46 ± 12.8 years, 82% female). Both healthy control groups had 105 participants (mean age 46 ± 13.1 and 46 ± 11.9 years, 82% female). Early learning was comparable across groups (Long-COVID: 0.36 ± 0.24 correct sequences/second, pandemic controls: 0.36 ± 0.53 prepandemic controls: 0.38 ± 0.57, patients vs pandemic controls [CI -0.068 to 0.067], vs prepandemic controls [CI -0.084 to 0.052], and between controls [CI -0.083 to 0.053], p = 0.82). Initial and final typing speeds on days 1 and 2 were slower in patients than controls. Patients with Long-COVID showed a significantly reduced overnight consolidation and a nonsignificant trend to reduced learning rates. Early learning was comparable in patients with Long-COVID and controls. Anomalous initial performance is consistent with executive dysfunction. Reduction in overnight consolidation may relate to deficits in procedural memory formation.","2024","2024 Feb 13","William Hayward; Ethan R Buch; Gina Norato; Fumiaki Iwane; Dabedatta Dash; Roberto F Salamanca-Girón; Elizabeth Bartrum; Brian Walitt; Avindra Nath; Leonardo G Cohen","From the Human Cortical Physiology and Neurorehabilitation Section (W.H., E.R.B., F.I., D.D., R.F.S.-G., L.G.C.), Clinical Trials Unit (G.N.), Office of the Clinical Director, and Section of Infections of the Nervous System (E.B., B.W., A.N.), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD.; From the Human Cortical Physiology and Neurorehabilitation Section (W.H., E.R.B., F.I., D.D., R.F.S.-G., L.G.C.), Clinical Trials Unit (G.N.), Office of the Clinical Director, and Section of Infections of the Nervous System (E.B., B.W., A.N.), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD.; From the Human Cortical Physiology and Neurorehabilitation Section (W.H., E.R.B., F.I., D.D., R.F.S.-G., L.G.C.), Clinical Trials Unit (G.N.), Office of the Clinical Director, and Section of Infections of the Nervous System (E.B., B.W., A.N.), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD.; From the Human Cortical Physiology and Neurorehabilitation Section (W.H., E.R.B., F.I., D.D., R.F.S.-G., L.G.C.), Clinical Trials Unit (G.N.), Office of the Clinical Director, and Section of Infections of the Nervous System (E.B., B.W., A.N.), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD.; From the Human Cortical Physiology and Neurorehabilitation Section (W.H., E.R.B., F.I., D.D., R.F.S.-G., L.G.C.), Clinical Trials Unit (G.N.), Office of the Clinical Director, and Section of Infections of the Nervous System (E.B., B.W., A.N.), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD.; From the Human Cortical Physiology and Neurorehabilitation Section (W.H., E.R.B., F.I., D.D., R.F.S.-G., L.G.C.), Clinical Trials Unit (G.N.), Office of the Clinical Director, and Section of Infections of the Nervous System (E.B., B.W., A.N.), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD.; From the Human Cortical Physiology and Neurorehabilitation Section (W.H., E.R.B., F.I., D.D., R.F.S.-G., L.G.C.), Clinical Trials Unit (G.N.), Office of the Clinical Director, and Section of Infections of the Nervous System (E.B., B.W., A.N.), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD.; From the Human Cortical Physiology and Neurorehabilitation Section (W.H., E.R.B., F.I., D.D., R.F.S.-G., L.G.C.), Clinical Trials Unit (G.N.), Office of the Clinical Director, and Section of Infections of the Nervous System (E.B., B.W., A.N.), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD.; From the Human Cortical Physiology and Neurorehabilitation Section (W.H., E.R.B., F.I., D.D., R.F.S.-G., L.G.C.), Clinical Trials Unit (G.N.), Office of the Clinical Director, and Section of Infections of the Nervous System (E.B., B.W., A.N.), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD.; From the Human Cortical Physiology and Neurorehabilitation Section (W.H., E.R.B., F.I., D.D., R.F.S.-G., L.G.C.), Clinical Trials Unit (G.N.), Office of the Clinical Director, and Section of Infections of the Nervous System (E.B., B.W., A.N.), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD."

The long-term trajectory of these sequelae is still unfolding. To assess the burden of anxiety and depression among patients presenting to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) post-COVID-19 clinic, we analyzed how patient factors influenced Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores. In this retrospective cohort study, the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questionnaire scores of patients presenting to the UIHC post-COVID clinic between March 2021-February 2022 (N = 455) were compared to the scores of a sample of patients presenting to the general internal medicine (GIM) clinic during the same period (N = 94). Our analysis showed that patients with an absent history of depression on their electronic medical record (EMR) problem list scored significantly higher on the GAD-7 (mean difference -1.62, 95% CI -3.12 to -0.12, p = 0.034) and PHQ-9 (mean difference -4.45, 95% CI -5.53 to -3.37, p < 0.001) questionnaires compared to their similar counterparts in the GIM clinic. On the other hand, patients with an absent history of anxiety on their EMR problem list scored significantly higher on the GAD-7 (mean difference -2.90, 95% CI -4.0 to -1.80, p < 0.001) but not on the PHQ-9 questionnaire (p = 0.196). Overall, patients with PASC may have experienced a heavier burden of newly manifest anxiety and depression symptoms compared to patients seen in the GIM clinic. This suggests that the mental health impacts of PASC may be more pronounced in patients with no prior history of anxiety or depression.","2024","2024 Dec","Michael C Sauer; Patrick B Barlow; Alejandro P Comellas; Alpana Garg","Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, 200 Hawkins Drive, Iowa City, IA, 52242, USA. mcsr@uiowa.edu.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, 200 Hawkins Drive, Iowa City, IA, 52242, USA.; Institute for Clinical and Translational Science, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.; Institute for Clinical and Translational Science, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, 200 Hawkins Drive, Iowa City, IA, 52242, USA."

This may result in an overestimation of the prevalence of those experiencing PCC, as these symptoms are non-specific and common in the general population. In this study, we aimed to compare the burden of persistent symptoms among COVID-19 survivors relative to COVID-19-negative controls. A systematic literature search was conducted using the following databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) until July 2023 for comparative studies that examined the prevalence of persistent symptoms in COVID-19 survivors. Given that many of the symptoms among COVID-19 survivors overlap with post-hospitalization syndrome and post-intensive care syndrome, we included studies that compare the prevalence of persistent symptoms in hospitalized COVID-19 patients relative to non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients and in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients relative to healthy controls that reported outcomes after at least 3 months since infection. The results of the meta-analysis were reported as odds ratios with a 95% confidence interval based on the random effects model. Twenty articles were included in this study. Our analysis of symptomatology in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to negative controls revealed that the majority of symptoms examined were not related to COVID-19 infection and appeared equally prevalent in both cohorts. However, non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients had higher odds of occurrence of certain symptoms like anosmia, ageusia, fatigue, dyspnea, and brain fog (P < 0.05). Particularly, anosmia and ageusia showed substantially elevated odds relative to the negative control group at 11.27 and 9.76, respectively, P < 0.05. In contrast, analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to those hospitalized for other indications did not demonstrate significantly higher odds for the tested symptoms. The persistent symptoms in COVID-19 survivors may result from hospitalization for causes unrelated to COVID-19 and are commonly reported among the general population. Although certain symptoms exhibited higher odds in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients relative to controls, these symptoms are common post-viral illnesses. Therefore, the persistent symptoms after COVID-19 may not be unique to SARS-CoV-2. Future studies including well-matched control groups when investigating persistent symptoms in COVID-19 survivors are warranted to draw a firm conclusion.","2024","2024 Jan 11","Ahmed Azzam; Heba Khaled; Neveen Refaey; Shorouk Mohsen; Ola Ali El-Emam; Nada Dawood; Hebatalla A Ahmed; Omar A Soliman; Sana Mostafa; Heba Ramadan; Maha Mosa; Amora Omar Ibrahim Elmowafy; Shimaa Mohamed Abdou Rizk; Ahmed Zaki; Mostafa Hussien; Ameer Ahmed; Ahmad Ashraf Ezzat; Fatma E Hassan","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt. ahmed.abdelkareem@pharm.helwan.edu.eg.; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.; Department of Physical Therapy for Women's Health, Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.; Public Health and Preventive Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.; Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.; Community Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt.; Department of Public Health and Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kafr-Elsheikh University, Kafr-Elsheikh, Egypt.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Alexandria, University Main Teaching Hospital, Alexandria, Egypt.; Human Genetics Department, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.; Oral Biology Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.; Pharmacy Department, Agamy Medical District, Ministry of Health and Population, Agamy, Alexandria, Egypt.; Otolaryngologist, Qeft Teaching Hospital, Qena, Egypt.; Medical Surgical Nursing Department, Faculty of Nursing, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.; Medical Surgical Nursing Department, Faculty of Nursing, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.; Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.; Faculty of Medicine, Suez Canal University, Suez City, Ismailia Governorate, Egypt.; Faculty of Medicine, Minia University, Minya, Egypt.; Faculty of Pharmacy, Minia University, Minya, Egypt.; Medical Physiology Department, Kasr Alainy, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Giza, 11562, Egypt.; Department of Physiology, General Medicine Practice Program, Batterjee Medical College, 21442, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."

Different non-pharmacological treatments have been proposed, and physiotherapy has been proposed to improve the symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a dual-task augmented reality rehabilitation protocol in people with long COVID fatigue and cognitive impairment. Ten non-hospitalized adults with reported fatigue and ""brain fog"" symptoms after COVID (7/10 females, 50 years, range 41-58) who participated in 20 sessions of a 1-h ""dual-task"" training, were compared to 10 long COVID individuals with similar demographics and symptoms (9/10 females, 56 years, range 43-65), who did not participate to any rehabilitation protocol. Cognitive performance was assessed with the Trail Making Test (TMT-A and -B) and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and cardiovascular and muscular fatigue were assessed with the fatigue severity scale (FSS), six-minute walking test and handgrip endurance. Finally, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) investigated cortical excitability. The mixed-factors analysis of variance found a significant interaction effect only in cognitive performance evaluation, suggesting TMT-B execution time decreased (- 15.9 s, 95% CI 7.6-24.1, P = 0.001) and FAB score improved (1.88, 95% CI 2.93-0.82, P = 0.002) only in the physiotherapy group. For the remaining outcomes, no interaction effect was found, and most parameters similarly improved in the two groups.

A retrospective analysis of records was conducted between September 2021 and December 2022. The analysis covered adults with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses. Data encompassed demographics, medical history, vaccination, disease severity, hospitalization, treatments, and post-COVID symptoms, analyzed using logistic regression. Among 289 participants, the average age was 51.51 years. Around 62.6% were females, and 93% received the COVID-19 vaccination, i.e., primarily the mRNA vaccine (48.4%) and the adenovirus vector-based vaccine (34.8%). Reinfections occurred in 11.76% of cases. Disease severity varied, with 75% having mild, 15% having moderate, and 10% having severe infections. Hospitalization rates were significant (25.6%), including 10.7% requiring intensive care. Thirteen distinct post-COVID symptoms were reported. Fatigue, shortness of breath upon exertion, and brain fog emerged as the most prevalent symptoms. Notably, females exhibited higher symptom prevalence. Significant correlations were established between higher BMI and smoking with augmented symptomatology. Conversely, a link between booster doses and symptom reduction was discerned. Using multinomial regression analysis, gender and smoking were identified as predictors of post-COVID-19 symptoms. The study underscores obesity, smoking, and the female gender's impact on long COVID symptoms; boosters show promise in alleviation.

Their quality of life is adversely impacted by persistent cognitive dysfunction and affective distress, but the underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study recruited a group of mostly young, previously healthy adults (24.4 ± 5.2 years of age) who experienced PASC for almost 6 months following a mild acute COVID-19 illness. Confirming prior evidence, they reported noticeable memory and attention deficits, brain fog, depression/anxiety, fatigue, and other symptoms potentially suggestive of excitation/inhibition imbalance. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was used to examine the neurochemical aspects of cell signaling with an emphasis on GABA levels in the occipital cortex. The PASC participants were compared to a control (CNT) group matched in demographics, intelligence, and an array of other variables. Controlling for tissue composition, biological sex, and alcohol intake, the PASC group had lower GABA+/water than CNT, which correlated with depression and poor sleep quality. The mediation analysis revealed that the impact of PASC on depression was partly mediated by lower GABA+/water, indicative of cortical hyperexcitability as an underlying mechanism. In addition, N-acetylaspartate (NAA) tended to be lower in the PASC group, possibly suggesting compromised neuronal integrity. Persistent neuroinflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of PASC-related neurocognitive dysfunction.","2023","2023 Dec 01","Ksenija Marinkovic; David R White; Austin Alderson Myers; Katie S Parker; Donatello Arienzo; Graeme F Mason","Spatio-Temporal Brain Imaging Lab, Department of Psychology, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182, USA.; Department of Radiology, University of California, San Diego, CA 92093, USA.; Spatio-Temporal Brain Imaging Lab, Department of Psychology, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182, USA.; Spatio-Temporal Brain Imaging Lab, Department of Psychology, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, CA 92093, USA.; Spatio-Temporal Brain Imaging Lab, Department of Psychology, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182, USA.; Spatio-Temporal Brain Imaging Lab, Department of Psychology, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182, USA.; Department of Radiology, University of California, San Diego, CA 92093, USA.; Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, Psychiatry, and Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."

In this retrospective cohort study, 4850 participants self-reported their COVID-19 sequelae symptoms between June and August 2022. A sedentary lifestyle included physical inactivity (<150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity) and prolonged sedentary behavior (≥10 h/day) before the fifth COVID-19 wave was recorded. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relationships between sedentary lifestyle and risk of acute and post-acute (lasting ≥2 months) COVID-19 sequelae. A total of 1443 COVID-19 survivors and 2962 non-COVID-19 controls were included. Of the COVID-19 survivors, >80% and >40% self-reported acute and post-acute COVID-19 sequelae, respectively. In the post-acute phase, COVID-19 survivors who were physically inactive had a 37% lower risk of insomnia, whereas those with prolonged sedentary behavior had 25%, 67%, and 117% higher risks of at least one symptom, dizziness, and ""pins and needles"" sensation, respectively. For the acute phase, prolonged sedentary behavior was associated with a higher risk of fatigue, ""brain fog,"" dyspnea, muscle pain, joint pain, dizziness, and ""pins and needles"" sensation. Notably, sedentary behavior, rather than physical inactivity, was correlated with a higher risk of severe post-COVID-19 sequelae in both acute and post-acute phases.

However, evidence on whether and the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts cognition irrespective of COVID-19 course and severity is limited to clinical samples and mainly comes from prognostic studies. We aimed to explore the association between serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and cognitive functioning in community-based and institutionalized older adults, irrespective of COVID-19 symptoms. We conducted a case-control study nested into two cohorts in Southern Switzerland. Eligible subjects were Italian speaking older adults, without a previous diagnosis of dementia, who underwent serological testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between November 2020 and July 2021. We manually selected age-, sex- and education-matched cases (i.e., individuals with a serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection), with seronegative controls, and we conducted in-person neuropsychological assessments using validated, highly sensitive cognitive tests. We completed 38 neuropsychological assessments in a mostly female sample of older adults (Mean age: 83.13 ± 8.95; 86.8% women). 17 were community dwelling individuals while 21 lived in a nursing home. As expected, socio-demographic characteristics of age, gender and educational level were similarly distributed between cases (n = 14) and controls (n = 24). In linear regression models, cases had significantly lower scores in cognitive tasks of memory (β = -0.367, p = 0.023), attention (β = 0.428, p = 0.008) and executive functions (β = 0.326, p = 0.046). We found no significant difference in tests of language and spatial-temporal orientation (all p values > 0.05). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with cognitive impairment in memory, attention, and executive functions in older adults. Our findings are consistent with mechanistic evidence of the neurotropism of the virus and provide empirical support for the ""Cognitive COVID"" construct also in non-clinical samples. With nearly 800 million COVID-19 cases (in April 2023), and many more infections worldwide, the clinical and public health implications of Cognitive COVID due to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be massive and warrant further epidemiological investigations.","2024","2024 Feb","Greta Rizzi; Deborah Pacifico; Serena Sabatini; Anna Maria Annoni; Federico Mele; Sandra Jovic; Luca Piccoli; Laurie Corna; Rebecca Amati; William Pertoldi; Maddalena Fiordelli; Federica Sallusto; Emiliano Albanese","Institute of Public Health, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Università Della Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland.; Institute of Public Health, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Università Della Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland.; Institute of Mental Health, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.; Institute of Public Health, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Università Della Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland.; Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Università Della Svizzera Italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland.; Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Università Della Svizzera Italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland.; Humabs BioMed SA, a Subsidiary of Vir Biotechnology, Bellinzona, Switzerland.; Centre of Competence on Ageing, Department of Business Economics, Health & Social Care, University of Applied Sciences & Arts of Southern Switzerland, Manno, Switzerland.; Institute of Public Health, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Università Della Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland.; Istituti Sociali, Chiasso, Switzerland.; Institute of Public Health, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Università Della Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland.; Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Università Della Svizzera Italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland.; Institute of Microbiology, ETH Zurich, Switzerland.; Institute of Public Health, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Università Della Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland."

While measures of type 1 SLE activity exist, most current physician-reported measures do not encompass type 2 SLE manifestations. To better evaluate type 2 SLE symptoms, we developed and psychometrically evaluated a physician-reported measure of type 2 symptoms, the Type 2 Physician Global Assessment ('Type 2 PGA'). The Type 2 PGA was developed and evaluated by six rheumatologists practising in the same academic lupus clinic. The study began with a roundtable discussion to establish consensus guidelines for scoring the Type 2 PGA. Following the roundtable, the Type 2 PGA was psychometrically evaluated using data prospectively collected from 263 patients with SLE enrolled in the Duke Lupus Registry. There was strong intra-rater and inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.83), indicating the Type 2 PGA scores were consistent within a rheumatologist and across rheumatologists. The Type 2 PGA was correlated with patient-reported symptoms of polysymptomatic distress (r=0.76), fatigue (r=0.68), cognitive dysfunction (r=0.63), waking unrefreshed (r=0.62) and forgetfulness (r=0.60), and weakly correlated with the Type 1 PGA and the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index. The Type 2 PGA performed well as a physician-reported measure of type 2 SLE symptoms. The incorporation of the Type 2 PGA into a routine rheumatology visit may improve patient care by bringing the provider's attention to certain symptoms not well represented in conventional measures of disease activity.","2023","2023 Dec 17","Megan E B Clowse; Jennifer L Rogers; Theresa Coles; David S Pisetsky; Lisa G Criscione-Schreiber; Dana Burshell; Jayanth Doss; Rebecca E Sadun; Kai Sun; Mithu Maheswaranathan; Amanda M Eudy","Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Population Health Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA amanda.eudy@duke.edu."

Some U.S. health surveys have found that women, lower income individuals, and those with less education are overrepresented among adults with long COVID, but these studies do not address intersectionality. To fill this gap, we conduct an intersectional analysis of the prevalence and outcomes of long COVID in the U.S. We posit that disparities in long COVID have less to do with the virus itself and more to do with social determinants of health, especially those associated with occupational segregation and the gendered division of household work. We use 10 rounds of Household Pulse Survey (HPS) data collected between June 2022 and March 2023 to perform an intersectional analysis using a battery of descriptive statistics that evaluate (1) the prevalence of long COVID and (2) the interference of long COVID symptoms with day-to-day activities. We also use the HPS data to estimate a set of multivariate logistic regressions that relate the odds of having long COVID and activity limitations due to long COVID to a set of individual characteristics as well as intersections by sex, race/ethnicity, education, and sexual orientation and gender identity. Findings indicate that women, some people of color, sexual and gender minorities, and people without college degrees are more likely to have long COVID and to have activity limitations from long COVID. Women have considerably higher odds of developing long COVID compared to men, a disparity exacerbated by having less education. Intersectional analysis by gender, race, ethnicity, and education reveals a striking step-like pattern: college-educated men have the lowest prevalence of long COVID while women without college educations have the highest prevalence. Daily activity limitations are more evenly distributed across demographics, but a different step-like pattern is present: fewer women with degrees have activity limitations while limitations are more widespread among men without degrees. Regression results confirm the negative association of long COVID with being a woman, less educated, Hispanic, and a sexual and gender minority, while results for the intersectional effects are more nuanced. Results point to systematic disparities in health, highlighting the urgent need for policies that increase access to quality healthcare, strengthen the social safety net, and reduce economic precarity.","2023","2023 Dec 13","Jennifer Cohen; Yana van der Meulen Rodgers","Department of Global and Intercultural Studies, Miami University, Oxford, OH, USA. cohenje@miamioh.edu.; Ezintsha, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. cohenje@miamioh.edu.; Department of Labor Studies and Employment Relations, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA."

This study investigated the association of serological biomarkers and treatments received during hospitalization with development of neuropathic-associated symptoms. One hundred and eighty-three (n = 183) previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors during the first wave of the pandemic were assessed in a face-to-face interview 9.4 months after hospitalization. Nineteen serological biomarkers, hospitalization data, and treatment during hospitalization were obtained from medical records. Neuropathic pain symptoms (Self-Report Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Scale), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale) and anxiety/depressive levels (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) were assessed. The prevalence of post-COVID pain was 40.9% (n = 75). Fifteen (20%) patients reported neuropathic symptoms. Overall, no differences in hospitalization data and serological biomarkers were identified according to the presence or not of neuropathic-associated symptoms. Patients with post-COVID pain had the highest neutrophil count, and post hoc analysis revealed that patients with neuropathic post-COVID associated symptoms had lower neutrophil count (p = 0.04) compared with those without neuropathic pain, but differences were small and possible not clinically relevant. No differences in fatigue, dyspnea, brain fog, anxiety or depressive levels, poor sleep, or pain catastrophism between patients with and without neuropathic symptoms were found. It seems that neuropathic-like post-COVID pain symptoms are not associated with neither of assessed serological biomarkers at hospital admission nor hospitalization treatments received in this cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 survivors.","2023","2023","César Fernández-de-Las-Peñas; Carlos Guijarro; María Velasco-Arribas; Juan Torres-Macho; Ana Franco-Moreno; Andrea Truini; Oscar Pellicer-Valero; Lars Arendt-Nielsen","Department of Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC), Madrid, Spain.; Center for Neuroplasticity and Pain (CNAP), SMI, Department of Health Science and Technology, Faculty of Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.; Department of Internal Medicine-Infectious Department, Research Department, Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón, Madrid, Spain.; Department of Medicine, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC), Madrid, Spain.; Department of Internal Medicine-Infectious Department, Research Department, Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón, Madrid, Spain.; Department of Medicine, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC), Madrid, Spain.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor-Virgen de la Torre, Madrid, Spain.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor-Virgen de la Torre, Madrid, Spain.; Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.; Image Processing Laboratory (IPL), Parc Científic de la Universitat de València, Valencia, Spain.; Center for Neuroplasticity and Pain (CNAP), SMI, Department of Health Science and Technology, Faculty of Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.; Mech-Sense, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Clinical Institute, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.; Steno Diabetes Center North Denmark, Clinical Institute, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark."

Annual International Conference","Humans; Connectome; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; COVID-19; Brain; White Matter","","Even after recovery from the COVID-19 infection, there have been a multitude of cases reporting post-COVID neurological symptoms including memory loss, brain fog, and attention deficit. Many studies have observed localized microstructural damages in the white matter regions of COVID survivors, indicating potential damage to the axonal pathways in the brain. Therefore, in this study, we have investigated the global impact of localized damage to white matter tracts using graph theoretical analysis of the structural connectome of 45 COVID-recovered subjects and 30 Healthy Controls (HCs). We have implemented Diffusion Tensor Imaging based reconstruction followed by deterministic tractography to extract structural connections among different regions of the brain. Interpreting this structural connectivity as weighted undirected graphs, we have used graph theoretical measures like global efficiency, characteristic path length (CPL), clustering coefficient (CC), modularity, Fiedler value, and assortativity coefficient to quantify the global integration, segregation, and robustness of the brain networks. We statistically compare the cohorts based on these graph measures by employing permutation testing for 100,000 permutations. Post multiple comparisons error correction, we find that the COVID-recovered cohort shows a reduction in global efficiency and CC while they exhibit higher modularity and CPL. This disruption of the balance between global integration and segregation indicates the loss of small-world property in COVID survivors' connectomes which has been linked with other disorders such as cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's. Overall, our study sheds light on the alterations in structural connectivity and its role in post-COVID symptoms.","2023","2023 Jul","Sapna S Mishra; Tapan K Gandhi; Bharat B Biswal",""

Unfortunately, an efficient and psychometrically sound instrument to assess these co-occurring symptoms is unavailable. Here, we report the development and initial psychometric properties of the Fatigue and Altered Cognition Scale (the FACs), a measure of self-reported central fatigue and brain fog. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was chosen to model and develop the FACs due to research team expertise and established links between TBI and the symptom complex. Potential items were generated by researchers and clinicians with experience treating these symptoms, drawing from relevant literature and review of patient responses to measures from past and current TBI studies. The 20 candidate items for the FACs-ten each to assess altered cognition (i.e., brain fog) and central fatigue-were formatted on an electronic visual analogue response scale (eVAS) via an online survey. Demographic information and history of TBI were obtained. A total of 519 participants consented and provided usable data (average age = 40.23 years; 73% female), 204 of whom self-reported a history of TBI (75% reported mild TBI). Internal consistency and reliability values were calculated. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) examined the presumed two-factor structure of the FACs and a one-factor solution for comparison. A measurement invariance test of the two latent constructs (altered cognition, fatigue) among participants with and without TBI was conducted. All items demonstrated normal distribution. Cronbach's alpha coefficients indicated good internal consistency for both factors (α's = .95). Omega reliability values were favorable (α's = .95). CFA supported the presumed two-factor model and item loadings which outperformed the one-factor model. Measurement invariance found the two-factor structure was consistent between the two groups.

Veterans with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result between October 1, 2021, the date ICD-10 code U09.9 was introduced, and January 31, 2023 (n = 388 980), and a randomly selected subsample of patients with the U09.9 code (n = 350) whose symptom prevalence was assessed by systematic medical record review, were included in the analysis. Positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Rates, clinical setting, risk factors, and symptoms associated with ICD-10 code U09.9 in the medical record. Among the 388 980 persons with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, the mean (SD) age was 61.4 (16.1) years; 87.3% were men. In terms of race and ethnicity, 0.8% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 1.4% were Asian, 20.7% were Black, 9.3% were Hispanic or Latino, 1.0% were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; and 67.8% were White. Cumulative incidence of U09.9 documentation was 4.79% (95% CI, 4.73%-4.87%) at 6 months and 5.28% (95% CI, 5.21%-5.36%) at 12 months after infection. Factors independently associated with U09.9 documentation included older age, female sex, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, comorbidity burden, and severe acute infection manifesting by symptoms, hospitalization, or ventilation. Primary vaccination (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.78-0.83]) and booster vaccination (AHR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.64-0.69]) were associated with a lower likelihood of U09.9 documentation. Marked differences by geographic region and facility in U09.9 code documentation may reflect local screening and care practices. Among the 350 patients undergoing systematic medical record review, the most common symptoms documented in the medical records among patients with the U09.9 code were shortness of breath (130 [37.1%]), fatigue or exhaustion (78 [22.3%]), cough (63 [18.0%]), reduced cognitive function or brain fog (22 [6.3%]), and change in smell and/or taste (20 [5.7%]). In this cohort study of 388 980 veterans, documentation of ICD-10 code U09.9 had marked regional and facility-level variability. Strong risk factors for U09.9 documentation were identified, while vaccination appeared to be protective.

An improved menopausal experience in the workplace has been found to be associated with increased job satisfaction, increased economic participation and reduced absenteeism. This work was undertaken to explore the impact of menopause on the working lives of NHS staff working in Wales, with specific emphasis on their experience of menopausal symptoms and management strategies in the workplace. This was a qualitative study using semi-structured focus groups and thematic analysis. 14 women working in the NHS in Wales attended four focus groups, lasting up to 1.5 h. Stem questions focused on participants' positive and negative experiences in the workplace, and their receipt of support. Transcripts were analysed using the framework approach. Three major themes were identified: experiences of menopausal symptoms and symptom management, the impact of menopause on work and the impact of work on the menopause. Menopause symptom experience in the workplace was multifaceted and varied, depending on factors such as ongoing or past symptom experience, expectations, social support and effectiveness of management strategies. Inconsistent information was highlighted as a reason why some participants felt confused both about the symptoms that they could attribute to the menopause and the management strategies available to them. A variety of symptom management strategies had been used by participants, including hormone replacement therapy, flexible working hours, working from home, changes to uniform, peer support and lifestyle changes, with varying levels of success. Some women were reticent to ask for support at work even though they felt the workplace response was likely to be supportive. Almost all the women felt that they had to persuade their GP to prescribe HRT and felt that their doctors were too reticent in prescribing this treatment. Employers have a key role in supporting their staff experiencing menopausal symptoms, and such support has the potential to reduce sickness absence and boost retention. Based on the findings we recommend creating an open culture to break down taboos; protected time for peer support around shared experiences and effective symptom management techniques; and maximising the impact of non-menopause-specific policies such as flexible working to help all staff manage fatigue and become more productive in their roles.","2024","2024 Feb","Gemma Hobson; Nicola Dennis","Public Health Wales, Wales, UK.; University of Birmingham, England, UK.

This is a prospective cohort study with 53 individuals with post-COVID condition at 3 time points: 0 to 3 (baseline), 3 to 6, and 6-12 months (follow-up). Outcomes were organized in dichotomous variable: No impairment (0); presence of impairment (≥1) in body function, structure, activities, and participation domains according to the ICF checklist. Chi-square test was used to determine the differences of 3 time points, and association with persistent symptoms. A statistically significant difference was observed between the periods, with greater disabilities at 6-12 than at 0-3 months in mental, sensory, pain, and movement-related functions; cardiovascular, immunological, and respiratory systems. In terms of activity and participation, a greater limitation at 6-12 months was observed than at 0-3 months in learning and applying knowledge, general tasks, and mobility. In the domain of interpersonal interactions and relationships, there was a statistically significant difference between the 6-12 and 3-6 months groups. Associations between COVID-19 symptoms and ICF components at the first follow-up were: anosmia and dysgeusia with weight maintenance, fatigue and irritability with pain, brain fog with watching and listening, walking difficulty with pain, and headache with pain, watching, and listening. At the second follow-up were: anosmia and dysgeusia with energy and drive functions, attention, memory, and emotional functions; dizziness with watching and listening; fatigue with emotional function, pain, undertaking multiple tasks, lifting and carrying objects, and driving; irritability with energy and drive, emotional function, undertaking multiple tasks, lifting and carrying objects, and walking; walking difficulty with energy and driving, emotional function, respiration, muscle power, cardiovascular system, undertaking multiple tasks, lifting and carrying objects, and walking; and headache with emotional function, watching, and listening.

A sample of 1,266 previously hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic were assessed at 8.4 (T1), 13.2 (T2), and 18.3 (T3) months after hospital discharge. They were asked about the presence of the following self-reported cognitive symptoms: brain fog (defined as self-perception of sluggish or fuzzy thinking), memory loss (defined as self-perception of unusual forgetfulness), and concentration loss (defined as self-perception of not being able to maintain attention). We asked about symptoms that individuals had not experienced previously, and they attributed them to the acute infection. Clinical and hospitalization data were collected from hospital medical records. The Sankey plots revealed that the prevalence of post-COVID brain fog was 8.37% (n = 106) at T1, 4.7% (n = 60) at T2, and 5.1% (n = 65) at T3, whereas the prevalence of post-COVID memory loss was 14.9% (n = 189) at T1, 11.4% (n = 145) at T2, and 12.12% (n = 154) at T3. Finally, the prevalence of post-COVID concentration loss decreased from 6.86% (n = 87) at T1, to 4.78% (n = 60) at T2, and to 2.63% (n = 33) at T3. The recovery exponential curves show a decreasing trend, indicating that these post-COVID cognitive symptoms recovered in the following years after discharge. The regression models did not reveal any medical record data associated with post-COVID brain fog, memory loss, or concentration loss in the long term. The use of Sankey plots shows a fluctuating evolution of post-COVID brain fog, memory loss, or concentration loss during the first years after the infection. In addition, exponential bar plots revealed a decrease in the prevalence of these symptoms during the first years after hospital discharge.

We included 241 individuals aged 18 and older who self-reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination and who joined the online Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) Study from May 2022 to July 2023. We summarized their demographics, health status, symptoms, treatments tried, and overall experience. The median age of participants was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38 to 56), with 192 (80%) identifying as female, 209 (87%) as non-Hispanic White, and 211 (88%) from the United States. Among these participants with PVS, 127 (55%) had received the BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] vaccine, and 86 (37%) received the mRNA-1273 [Moderna] vaccine. The median time from the day of index vaccination to symptom onset was three days (IQR: 1 day to 8 days). The time from vaccination to symptom survey completion was 595 days (IQR: 417 to 661 days). The median Euro-QoL visual analogue scale score was 50 (IQR: 39 to 70). The five most common symptoms were exercise intolerance (71%), excessive fatigue (69%), numbness (63%), brain fog (63%), and neuropathy (63%). In the week before survey completion, participants reported feeling unease (93%), fearfulness (82%), and overwhelmed by worries (81%), as well as feelings of helplessness (80%), anxiety (76%), depression (76%), hopelessness (72%), and worthlessness (49%) at least once. Participants reported a median of 20 (IQR: 13 to 30) interventions to treat their condition.

The study included 87 patients with post-COVID condition, 50 patients with ME/CFS, and 50 healthy controls (HC). The hemodynamic autonomic function was evaluated using the deep breathing technique, Valsalva maneuver, and Tilt test. The presence of autonomic and sensory small fiber neuropathy (SFN) was assessed with the Sudoscan and with heat and cold evoked potentials, respectively. Finally, a complete neuropsychological evaluation was performed. The objective of this study was to analyze and compare the autonomic and neuropathic symptoms in post-COVID condition with ME/CFS, and HC, as well as, analyze the relationship of these symptoms with cognition and fatigue. Statistically significant differences were found between groups in heart rate using the Kruskal-Wallis test (H), with ME/CFS group presenting the highest (H = 18.3; p ≤ .001). The Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), and pathological values in palms on the Sudoscan were found in 31% and 34% of ME/CFS, and 13.8% and 19.5% of post-COVID patients, respectively. Concerning evoked potentials, statistically significant differences were found in response latency to heat stimuli between groups (H = 23.6; p ≤ .01). Latency was highest in ME/CFS, and lowest in HC. Regarding cognition, lower parasympathetic activation was associated with worse cognitive performance. Both syndromes were characterized by inappropriate tachycardia at rest, with a high percentage of patients with POTS. The prolonged latencies for heat stimuli suggested damage to unmyelinated fibers. The higher proportion of patients with pathological results for upper extremities on the Sudoscan suggested a non-length-dependent SFN.","2023","2023 Nov 15","N Azcue; R Del Pino; M Acera; T Fernández-Valle; N Ayo-Mentxakatorre; T Pérez-Concha; A Murueta-Goyena; J V Lafuente; A Prada; A López de Munain; G Ruiz Irastorza; D Martín-Iglesias; L Ribacoba; I Gabilondo; J C Gómez-Esteban; B Tijero-Merino","Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Plaza de Cruces 12, 48903, Barakaldo (Bizkaia), CP, Spain.; Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Plaza de Cruces 12, 48903, Barakaldo (Bizkaia), CP, Spain. delpinorocio@gmail.com.; Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Plaza de Cruces 12, 48903, Barakaldo (Bizkaia), CP, Spain.; Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Plaza de Cruces 12, 48903, Barakaldo (Bizkaia), CP, Spain.; Department of Neurology, Cruces University Hospital-OSAKIDETZA, Barakaldo, Spain.; Department of Neurosciences, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Leioa, Spain.; Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Plaza de Cruces 12, 48903, Barakaldo (Bizkaia), CP, Spain.; Department of Neurology, Cruces University Hospital-OSAKIDETZA, Barakaldo, Spain.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain.; Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Plaza de Cruces 12, 48903, Barakaldo (Bizkaia), CP, Spain.; Department of Neurosciences, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Leioa, Spain.; Department of Neurosciences, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Leioa, Spain.; Department of Immunology, Donostia University Hospital-OSAKIDETZA, San Sebastián, Spain.; Spanish Network for the Research in Multiple Sclerosis, San Sebastian, Spain.; Department of Neurology, Donostia University Hospital-OSAKIDETZA, San Sebastián, Spain.; Department of Neurosciences, Biodonostia Health Research Institute, San Sebastián, Spain.; Department of Neurosciences, University of the Basque Country UPV-EHU, San Sebastián, Spain.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain.; CIBERNED-CIBER, Institute Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; Autoimmune Diseases Research Unit, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.; Department of Autoimmune Diseases, Cruces University Hospital-OSAKIDETZA, Barakaldo, Spain.; Autoimmune Diseases Research Unit, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.; Department of Autoimmune Diseases, Cruces University Hospital-OSAKIDETZA, Barakaldo, Spain.; Department of Internal Medicine, Cruces University Hospital, Barakaldo, Spain.; Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Plaza de Cruces 12, 48903, Barakaldo (Bizkaia), CP, Spain.; Department of Neurology, Cruces University Hospital-OSAKIDETZA, Barakaldo, Spain.; The Basque Foundation for Science, IKERBASQUE, Bilbao, Spain.; Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Plaza de Cruces 12, 48903, Barakaldo (Bizkaia), CP, Spain. juancarlosgomezesteban@gmail.com.; Department of Neurology, Cruces University Hospital-OSAKIDETZA, Barakaldo, Spain. juancarlosgomezesteban@gmail.com.; Department of Neurosciences, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Leioa, Spain. juancarlosgomezesteban@gmail.com.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain. juancarlosgomezesteban@gmail.com.; CIBERNED-CIBER, Institute Carlos III, Madrid, Spain. juancarlosgomezesteban@gmail.com.; Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Plaza de Cruces 12, 48903, Barakaldo (Bizkaia), CP, Spain.; Department of Neurology, Cruces University Hospital-OSAKIDETZA, Barakaldo, Spain.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain.; CIBERNED-CIBER, Institute Carlos III, Madrid, Spain."

Among 8000 sampled adults with polymerase-chain-reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 between June 2020 and July 2021 in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System, 2533 completed our survey (response rate 32.2%). Using modified Poisson regression, we examined sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical predictors of eight Long COVID symptom clusters, defined as at least one applicable symptom lasting 90 or more days post COVID-19 onset. Neuropsychiatric Long COVID symptoms, including brain fog, were most prevalent (23.7%), followed by systemic symptoms (17.1%), including fatigue, musculoskeletal (11.4%), pulmonary (10.4%), dermatologic (6.7%), cardiovascular (6.1%), gastrointestinal (5.4%), and ear, nose, and throat symptoms (5.3%). In adjusted analyses, female sex, a pre-existing psychological condition, and intensive care unit admission were strong predictors of most Long COVID symptom clusters. Older age was not associated with a higher prevalence of all symptoms - cardiovascular and dermatologic symptoms were most prevalent among middle-aged adults and age was not associated with neuropsychiatric or gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, there were fewer associations between pre-existing conditions and cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, and dermatologic symptoms compared to other symptom clusters. While many predictors of Long COVID symptom clusters were similar, the relationship with age and pre-existing conditions varied across clusters. Cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, and dermatologic symptoms require further study as potentially distinct from other Long COVID symptoms.","2023","2023 Dec","Jana L Hirschtick; Yanmei Xie; Elizabeth Slocum; Robert E Hirschtick; Laura E Power; Michael R Elliott; Robert C Orellana; Nancy L Fleischer","Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, 1415 Washington Heights, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.

How does ETI affect mental health, cognitive processing, neuropsychological side effects, GI symptoms, and health-related quality of life over time? This was a prospective, ""real-world"" longitudinal study. Participants were recruited consecutively and evaluated at initiation (T0) and after 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months of starting treatment. Assessments included depression (nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety (seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder), cognition (Symbol Digit Modalities Test), GI Symptom Tracker, and health-related quality of life (Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised).

Following descriptive analyses, longitudinal data were analyzed by using mixed models for repeated measures, controlling for age and sex when appropriate. Ninety-two consecutive pwCF (female/male, 46/46; mean age, 25.4 years) participated. FEV1 increased initially and then remained stable. BMI also increased significantly from T0 to 6 months (P < .01). Depression improved from T0 to 1 month (P < .001); however, no changes in anxiety were found. Cognitive processing improved from T0 to subsequent assessments.

The presence of residual symptoms in COVID-19 survivors has been investigated with various results; however, there is limited data documenting outcomes longer than 6 months post-hospitalization. We aimed to investigate the 12-month lasting effects of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. From October 2020 through March 2021, 92 patients were enrolled. At admission and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-hospitalization, demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging data, and echocardiography and spirometry test results were recorded. Possible cognitive and functional impairment, as well as the quality of life (QoL), were also assessed. In our cohort (median age: 61 years), 31.5% had severe disease at admission, which correlated with worse laboratory findings and a longer hospital stay (p < 0.001). Inflammatory markers were associated with severity initially, but reverted to normal after 3 months. In total, 55%, 37%, 19%, and 15.5% of patients reported at least one persistent symptom in months 1, 3, 6, and 12, respectively, while ""brain fog"" persisted up to 12 months in 10% of patients.

Recent evidence suggests that the multifaceted nature of this syndrome results in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary sequelae,chronic dyspnoea, persistent fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction being the most common, debilitating symptoms. Several mechanisms engender or exacerbate cognitive impairment, including central nervous system and extra-central nervous system causes, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. Both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients may suffer varying degrees of cognitive impairment, ranging from fatigue and brain fog to prolonged deficits in memory and attention, detrimental to the quality-of-life years post-recovery. The aim of this review is to understand the underlying mechanisms, associations, and attempts for prevention with early intervention of long-term cognitive impairment post-COVID-19. A systematic search was conducted through multiple databases such as Medline, National Library of Medicine, Ovid, Scopus database to retrieve all the articles on the long-term sequalae of cognitive dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The inclusion criteria included all articles pertinent to this specific topic and exclusion criteria subtracted studies pertaining to other aetiologies of cognitive dysfunction. This search was carefully screened for duplicates and the relevant information was extracted and analysed. To date, the exact pathogenesis, and underlying mechanisms behind cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19, remain unclear, hindering the development of adequate management strategies. However, the proposed mechanisms suggested by various studies include direct damage to the blood-brain barrier, systemic inflammation, prolonged hypoxia, and extended intensive care admissions. However, no clear-cut guidelines for management are apparent. This review of the COVID-19 pandemic has elucidated a new global challenge which is affecting individuals' quality of life by inducing long-term impaired cognitive function. The authors have found that comprehensive evaluations and interventions are crucial to address the cognitive sequelae in all COVID-19 patients, especially in patients with pre-existing cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, the authors recommend further research for the development of relevant, timely neurocognitive assessments and treatment plans.","2023","2023 Nov","Sanobar Shariff; Olivier Uwishema; Jocelyn Mizero; Vimala Devi Thambi; Abubakar Nazir; Ashraf Mahmoud; Ikshwaki Kaushik; Saadeddine Khayat; Abdulkadir Yusif Maigoro; Sara Awde; Zeina Al Maaz; Iktimal Alwan; Mahdi Hijazi; Jack Wellington; Lee Soojin","Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Yerevan State Medical University, Yerevan, Armenia.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Clinton Global Initiative University, NY.; Faculty of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Ghana Medical School, Accra, Ghana.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; R- endo Inc, Hamilton, NJ & Dr. NTR University Health Sciences.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Department of Medicine, King Edward Medical University, Lahore, Pakistan.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Faculty of Medicine, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College KCMUCo, Tanzania.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Faculty of Medicine, David Tvildiani Medical University, Tbilisi, Georgia.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Faculty of Medicine, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Faculty of Medicine, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Faculty of Medicine, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Faculty of Medicine, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Faculty of Medicine, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Faculty of Medicine, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Oli Health Magazine Organization, Research and Education, Kigali, Rwanda.; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea."

Long-term effects of SARS-CoV2 COVID-19 syndrome referred to as post-COVID-19 syndrome on age-related progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease remain understudied. Using the targeted misexpression of individual SARS-CoV2 proteins in the retinal neurons of the Drosophila melanogaster eye, we found that misexpression of nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3), a papain-like protease, ablates the eye and generates dark necrotic spots. Targeted misexpression of Nsp3 in the eye triggers reactive oxygen species production and leads to apoptosis as shown by cell death reporters, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and dihydroethidium staining. Furthermore, Nsp3 misexpression activates both apoptosis and autophagy mechanism(s) to regulate tissue homeostasis. Transient expression of SARS-CoV2 Nsp3 in murine neuroblastoma, Neuro-2a cells, significantly reduced the metabolic activity of these cells and triggers cell death. Misexpression of SARS-CoV2 Nsp3 in an Alzheimer’s disease transgenic fly eye model (glass multiple repeats [GMR]>amyloid β42) further enhances the neurodegenerative rough eye phenotype due to increased cell death. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV2 utilizes Nsp3 protein to potentiate cell death response in a neurodegenerative disease background that has high pre-existing levels of neuroinflammation and cell death.","2024","2024 Jun 01","Aditi Singh; Anuradha Venkatakrishnan Chimata; Prajakta Deshpande; Soumya Bajpai; Anjali Sangeeth; Mrigendra Rajput; Amit Singh","Department of Biology, University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA.; Department of Biology, University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA.; Department of Biology, University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA.; Department of Biology, University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA.; Department of Biology, University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA.; Department of Biology, University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA.; Department of Biology, University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA.; Premedical Program, University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA.; Center for Tissue Regeneration and Engineering at Dayton (TREND), University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA.; The Integrative Science and Engineering Center, University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA.; Center for Genomic Advocacy (TCGA), Indiana State University, Terre Haute, IN, USA."

Although PANS is typically described as relapsing-remitting, a large community-based 2017 study revealed a range of courses. The present study examined clinical predictors of symptom persistence, measured as % days symptom-free, in this same sample. Methods: A 146-question online survey gathered histories (infections and other triggers, medical and developmental comorbidities), symptomatology, interventions, and outcomes (including school functioning) of PANS patients. Multivariate analyses were applied to examine associations between these variables and % days symptom-free across the disease course. Results: Among the 646 subjects included, significant relationships were found between greater symptom persistence and higher rates of medical comorbidities (especially rashes, headaches, chronic sinusitis, frequent diarrhea, and immune deficiencies), developmental diagnoses, and respondent-perceived developmental lags. Subjects with greater symptom persistence were significantly more likely to report PANS exacerbations associated with infections in close contacts, vaccinations, environmental triggers, and exacerbations of comorbidities and were more likely to report PANS recurrences triggered by Epstein Barr Virus, mycoplasma, and sinus infections. More persistent PANS was also associated with significantly higher frequencies of certain symptoms (sleep disturbance, urinary incontinence, muscle pain, brain fog, sensory defensiveness, irritability, and aggression-related symptoms), less effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin in combating symptoms, and more difficulty attending school. Conclusions: Our results suggest high symptom persistence in PANS to be associated with more pervasive medical and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Differences in symptom persistence are associated with both intrinsic (e.g., immune competence) and extrinsic (e.g., infections, treatment) factors. Because extrinsic factors are potentially modifiable, it is critical that providers be aware of current guidelines on PANS evaluation and treatment.","2023","2023 Nov","Denise Calaprice-Whitty; Angela Tang; Janice Tona","Division of Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA.; Brain Inflammation Collaborative, Delafield, Wisconsin, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA.; Department of Rehabilitation Science, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA."

One hundred and eighty-three (n = 183) patients who had been hospitalized due to COVID-19 in one urban hospital of Madrid (Spain) during the first wave of the pandemic were assessed in a face-to-face interview 9.4 (SD 3.4) months after hospitalization. Levels of 19 serological biomarkers, hospitalization data, and treatments during hospitalization were obtained from hospital records. Sensitization-associated symptoms (Central Sensitization Inventory, CSI), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), pain catastrophism (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), and anxiety/depressive level (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS) were assessed. The prevalence of post-COVID pain was 40.9% (n = 75). Twenty-nine (38.6%) patients had sensitization-associated symptoms. Overall, no differences in hospitalization data and serological biomarkers were identified according to the presence of sensitization-associated symptoms. The analysis revealed that patients with sensitization-associated symptoms exhibited higher lymphocyte count and lower urea levels than those without sensitization-associated symptoms, but differences were small. Pain catastrophism and depressive levels, but not fatigue, dyspnea, brain fog, anxiety levels, or poor sleep, were higher in individuals with sensitization-associated symptoms. In conclusion, this study revealed that sensitization-associated post-COVID pain symptoms are not associated with serological biomarkers at hospital admission and hospitalization treatments received.","2023","2023 Oct 12","César Fernández-de-Las-Peñas; Carlos Guijarro; Juan Torres-Macho; Oscar J Pellicer-Valero; Ana Franco-Moreno; Jo Nijs; María Velasco-Arribas","Department of Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC), 28922 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Internal Medicine-Infectious Department, Research Department, Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón, 28922 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Medicine, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC), 28922 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor-Virgen de la Torre, 28031 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.; Image Processing Laboratory (IPL), Universitat de València, Parc Científic, 46980 València, Spain.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor-Virgen de la Torre, 28031 Madrid, Spain.; Pain in Motion Research Group (PAIN), Department of Physiotherapy, Human Physiology and Anatomy, Faculty of Physical Education & Physiotherapy, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1050 Ixelles, Belgium.; Chronic Pain Rehabilitation Center, Department of Physical Medicine and Physiotherapy, University Hospital Brussels, 1050 Ixelles, Belgium.; Department of Health and Rehabilitation, Unit of Physiotherapy, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, 41390 Göterbog, Sweden.; Department of Internal Medicine-Infectious Department, Research Department, Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón, 28922 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Medicine, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC), 28922 Madrid, Spain."

He reported feeling depressed, brain fogginess, loss of concentration, fatigue, and constant changes in moods. He had tried multiple antidepressants and antipsychotics, seen several therapists, and underwent electroconvulsive therapy in 2014 with no improvement. In August 2021, he underwent the standard TMS protocol with 36 treatments and noticed significant improvement in his symptoms. He followed up with his psychiatrist who placed him on quetiapine 400 mg, lurasidone 120 mg, topiramate 100 mg, Adderall 20 mg, Wellbutrin 150 mg, propranolol 20 mg, and Klonopin 0.5 mg for management. However, after starting these medications, he noticed a loss of concentration, not being able to think straight, fatigue, depression, and a change in moods. In January 2023, the patient underwent maintenance TMS treatment with theta bursts (TBS). The treatment protocol consisted of 10 sessions for 3 ½ minutes each, 20 trains, 10 bursts, and eight seconds between intervals. He completed his treatment and reported feeling great and like himself again. Two weeks following treatment, he reported that his brain fog had resolved, hypomanic episodes had lessened, and depressive moods had been occurring less often. Due to improvement, topiramate and lurasidone were discontinued and the patient will continue with monthly follow-ups to monitor his progress.

Some of the most persistent and common complaints of this post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) are cognitive in nature, described subjectively as ""brain fog"" and also objectively measured as deficits in executive function, working memory, attention, and processing speed. The mechanisms of these chronic cognitive sequelae are currently not understood. SARS-CoV-2 inflicts damage to cerebral blood vessels and the intestinal wall by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and also by evoking production of high levels of systemic cytokines, compromising the brain's neurovascular unit, degrading the intestinal barrier, and potentially increasing the permeability of both to harmful substances. Such substances are hypothesized to be produced in the gut by pathogenic microbiota that, given the profound effects COVID-19 has on the gastrointestinal system, may fourish as a result of intestinal post-COVID-19 dysbiosis. COVID-19 may therefore create a scenario in which neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory substances readily proliferate from the gut lumen and encounter a weakened neurovascular unit, gaining access to the brain and subsequently producing cognitive deficits. Here, we review this proposed PACS pathogenesis along the gut-brain axis, while also identifying specific methodologies that are currently available to experimentally measure each individual component of the model.","2023","2023","Allison M Plummer; Yvette L Matos; Henry C Lin; Sephira G Ryman; Aleksandr Birg; Davin K Quinn; Alisha N Parada; Andrei A Vakhtin","School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, United States.; The Mind Research Network/Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM, United States.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, United States.; Section of Gastroenterology, New Mexico Veterans Affairs Health Care System, Albuquerque, NM, United States.; The Mind Research Network/Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM, United States.; Nene and Jamie Koch Comprehensive Movement Disorder Center, Department of Neurology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, United States.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, United States.; Section of Gastroenterology, New Mexico Veterans Affairs Health Care System, Albuquerque, NM, United States.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, United States.; Division of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, United States.; The Mind Research Network/Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM, United States."

In this observational and multicenter study, the relationship between the sociodemographic and clinical profile of Spanish patients diagnosed with long COVID, and the work-related disability resulting from this pathology was analyzed. The analysis included 689 responses. A descriptive analysis of the variables recorded was performed, together with a bivariate analysis to determine associations between work-related disability and variables such as gender, age, health status, disabling symptoms or comorbidities. The results obtained highlight fatigue and lack of concentration (brain fog) as the most incapacitating symptoms among patients diagnosed with long COVID. Multivariate analysis revealed that time since diagnosis (OR: 0.57, CI95%: 0.36-0.89, p: 0.013), concomitant renal insufficiency (OR: 4.04, CI95%: 1.42-11.4, p: 0.008), and symptoms like fatigue (OR: 0.56, CI95%: 0.33-0.99) and tremors (OR: 2.0, CI95%: 1.06-3.69, p: 0.029), were associated with work-related disability. These findings highlight the need to improve the health and work-related management of this condition in the healthcare system. Besides risk factor control, it is suggested to pay special attention to determining the appropriate timing of medical leave work reintegration, along with coordination between primary care and occupational health services to ensure the gradual and tailored return of patients with long COVID to the workforce.","2023","2023 Sep 27","Esperanza Romero-Rodriguez; Luis Angel Perula-de Torres; Jaime Monserrat-Villatoro; Jesus Gonzalez-Lama; Ana Belen Carmona-Casado; Antonio Ranchal-Sanchez","Maimonides Institute for Biomedical Research of Córdoba (IMIBIC), Reina Sofía University Hospital, Córdoba University, 14004 Córdoba, Spain.; Córdoba and Guadalquivir Health District, 14011 Córdoba, Spain.; Maimonides Institute for Biomedical Research of Córdoba (IMIBIC), Reina Sofía University Hospital, Córdoba University, 14004 Córdoba, Spain.; Maimonides Institute for Biomedical Research of Córdoba (IMIBIC), Reina Sofía University Hospital, Córdoba University, 14004 Córdoba, Spain.; Córdoba and Guadalquivir Health District, 14011 Córdoba, Spain.; Maimonides Institute for Biomedical Research of Córdoba (IMIBIC), Reina Sofía University Hospital, Córdoba University, 14004 Córdoba, Spain.; ""Matrona Antonia Mesa Fernández"" Health Center, Cabra Clinical Management Unit, AGS South of Córdoba, 14940 Córdoba, Spain.; Maimonides Institute for Biomedical Research of Córdoba (IMIBIC), Reina Sofía University Hospital, Córdoba University, 14004 Córdoba, Spain.; Maimonides Institute for Biomedical Research of Córdoba (IMIBIC), Reina Sofía University Hospital, Córdoba University, 14004 Córdoba, Spain.; Department of Nursing, Pharmacology and Physiotherapy, Faculty of Medicine and Nursing, University of Cordoba, 14004 Córdoba, Spain."

This study aimed to explore the durability of primary booster administration and the preventive effect of second or multiple booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. We established a bidirectional cohort in Guizhou Province, China. Eligible participants who had received the primary booster dose were enrolled for blood sample collection and administration of the second booster dose. A retrospective cohort for the time of administration was constructed to evaluate antibody attenuation 6-12 months after the primary booster dose, while a prospective cohort on the vaccine effect of the second booster dose was constructed for 4 months after the second administration. Between September 21, 2022, and January 30, 2023, a total of 327 participants were included in the final statistical analysis plan. The retrospective cohort revealed that approximately 6-12 months after receiving the primary booster, immunoglobulin G (IgG) slowly declined with time, while immunoglobulin A (IgA) remained almost constant. The prospective cohort showed that 28 days after receiving the second booster, the antibody levels were significantly improved. Higher levels of IgG and IgA were associated with better protection against COVID-19 infection for vaccine recipients. Regarding the protection of antibody levels against post-COVID-19 symptoms, the increase of the IgG had a protective effect on brain fog and sleep quality, while IgA had a protective effect on shortness of breath, brain fog, impaired coordination, and physical pain. The IgG and IgA produced by the second booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines can protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and may alleviate some post-COVID-19 symptoms. Further data and studies on secondary booster administration are required to confirm these conclusions.","2023","2023 Oct 11","Ming Liu; Tianshuo Zhao; Qiuyue Mu; Ruizhi Zhang; Chunting Liu; Fei Xu; Luxiang Liang; Linglu Zhao; Suye Zhao; Xianming Cai; Mingting Wang; Ninghua Huang; Tian Feng; Shiguang Lei; Guanghong Yang; Fuqiang Cui","Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guiyang, China.; Department of Laboratorial Science and Technology, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Vaccine Research Center, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Center for Infectious Diseases and Policy Research & Global Health and Infectious Diseases Group, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Key Laboratory of Epidemiology of Major Diseases, Peking University, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.; Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guiyang, China.; Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guiyang, China.; Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guiyang, China.; Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guiyang, China.; Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guiyang, China.; Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guiyang, China.; Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guiyang, China.; Department of Laboratorial Science and Technology, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Vaccine Research Center, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Center for Infectious Diseases and Policy Research & Global Health and Infectious Diseases Group, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Key Laboratory of Epidemiology of Major Diseases, Peking University, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.; Department of Laboratorial Science and Technology, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Vaccine Research Center, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Center for Infectious Diseases and Policy Research & Global Health and Infectious Diseases Group, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Key Laboratory of Epidemiology of Major Diseases, Peking University, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.; Department of Laboratorial Science and Technology, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Vaccine Research Center, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Center for Infectious Diseases and Policy Research & Global Health and Infectious Diseases Group, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Key Laboratory of Epidemiology of Major Diseases, Peking University, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.; Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guiyang, China.; Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guiyang, China.; Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guiyang, China.; Department of Laboratorial Science and Technology, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Vaccine Research Center, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Center for Infectious Diseases and Policy Research & Global Health and Infectious Diseases Group, Peking University, Beijing, China.; Key Laboratory of Epidemiology of Major Diseases, Peking University, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China."

SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes an acute respiratory infection but can progress into significant neurological complications in some. Moreover, patients with severe acute COVID-19 could develop debilitating long-term sequela. Long-COVID is characterized by chronic symptoms that persist months after the initial infection. Common complaints are fatigue, myalgias, depression, anxiety, and ""brain fog,"" or cognitive and memory impairments. A recent study demonstrated that a mild COVID-19 respiratory infection could generate elevated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the cerebral spinal fluid. This commentary discusses findings from this study, demonstrating that even a mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause considerable neuroinflammation with microglial and macrophage reactivity. Such changes could also be gleaned by measuring chemokines and cytokines in the circulating blood. Moreover, neuroinflammation caused by mild SARS-CoV-2 infection can also impair hippocampal neurogenesis, deplete oligodendrocytes, and decrease myelinated axons. All these changes likely contribute to cognitive deficits in long-COVID syndrome. Therefore, strategies capable of restraining neuroinflammation, maintaining better hippocampal neurogenesis, and preserving oligodendrocyte lineage differentiation and maturation may prevent or reduce the incidence of long-COVID after SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection.","2023","2023 Dec 01","Zhuang-Yao D Wei; Ketty Liang; Ashok K Shetty","Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Texas A&M University Health Science Center School of Medicine, College Station, TX, USA.; Sam Houston State University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Conroe, TX, USA.; Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Texas A&M University Health Science Center School of Medicine, College Station, TX, USA."

Patients describe the brain fog as problems with attention, memory and mental fatigue. Brain fog is experienced by 9-55% of people for months after having contracted SARS-CoV-2 virus. Several theories have been proposed to explain PACS's brain fog, including a neuroinflammatory hypothesis, but the hypothesis remains to be proven. Here, we examined inflammatory and immunological blood profile in a cohort of patients with PACS to investigate the association between executive functions and blood inflammatory markers. Executive function was assessed by the Trail Making Test (TMT) Part A and Part B, as well as the Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (BDEFS), in 71 patients (36 men), average age of 40 years (range: 15-82, SD: 15.7). Impairment in executive functioning (BDEFS scores and TMT B scores) correlated with increased levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), fibrinogen and ferritin. Moreover, elevated levels of Il-6, fibrinogen, ferritin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and C-reactive protein have been observed in PACS. These findings demonstrate that PACS is characterized by the presence of an immuno-inflammatory process, which is associated with diminished executive functioning. Here, we argue in favour of a shift from the non-descriptive definition of 'mental fog' to a characterization of a subtype of PACS, associated with alteration in executive functioning. Implication for clinical settings and prevention are discussed.","2023","2023 Nov","Stefano Pallanti; Michele Di Ponzio; Gioele Gavazzi; Gregory Gasic; Bianca Besteher; Carina Heller; Ron Kikinis; Nikos Makris; Zora Kikinis","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Science, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, USA; Istituto di Neuroscienze, Florence, Italy.

In this study, we aimed to examine the characteristics of brain fog and to understand how fatigue, cognitive performance, and neuropsychiatric symptoms and the mutual relationships among these variables influence subjective cognitive complaints. A total of 170 patients with cognitive complaints in the context of post-COVID syndrome were evaluated using a comprehensive neuropsychological protocol. The FLEI scale was used to characterize subjective cognitive complaints. Correlation analysis, regression machine-learning algorithms, and mediation analysis were calculated. Cognitive complaints were mainly attention and episodic memory symptoms, while executive functions (planning) issues were less often reported. The FLEI scale, a mental ability questionnaire, showed high correlations with a fatigue scale and moderate correlations with the Stroop test, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Random forest algorithms showed an R2 value of 0.409 for the prediction of FLEI score, with several cognitive tests, fatigue and depression being the best variables used in the prediction. Mediation analysis showed that fatigue was the main mediator between objective and subjective cognition, while the effect of depression was indirect and mediated through fatigue. Brain fog associated with COVID-19 is mainly characterized by attention and episodic memory, and fatigue, which is the main mediator between objective and subjective cognition.

Long COVID is emerging as a complex and debilitating condition that occurs in a subpopulation of patients following acute COVID-19 infection. Our goals were to explore how to best treat and manage long COVID syndrome based on current experience. This is a perspective rather than a systematic review. It is based on the limited available literature and current clinical experience. Although a few pharmacological agents have been proposed to mitigate symptoms, none have emerged to provide meaningful, long-term pain relief. Long COVID is associated with numerous and diverse symptoms. Risk factors for developing long COVID subsequent to acute COVID-19 remain unknown. Due to the multidimensional impact of long COVID chronic pain, a structured interdisciplinary rehabilitation model has been proposed to relieve pain, restore function, and maximize quality of life. This is a perspective with an editorial point of view rather than a systematic literature study. Long COVID syndrome is a new condition, with which no clinicians have extensive experience. This is not a systematic review so there is no Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses diagram. This is not a clinical study so there was no need for institutional review board approvals. Treatment goals for the postviral syndrome of long COVID are multifaceted. In addition to pain control, patients may have functional deficits, cognitive issues, mental health issues, and reduced quality of life. Thus, a structured interdisciplinary rehabilitation model seems most appropriate to manage long COVID.

A 41-year-old woman with bilateral breast augmentation presented with nonspecific symptoms like pain, fatigue, and brain fog. After doing all workups and ruling out other causes, she underwent implant removal surgery with the diagnosis of BII. The patient's symptoms disappeared after the surgical intervention to remove the breast implants. Overall, the case presented highlights the importance of considering breast implant illness (BII) as a potential cause of general and nonspecific symptoms in patients with breast implants. BII is a condition that can cause physical and psychological symptoms and can be challenging to diagnose due to its non-specific nature.

The nervous system is involved in over one-third of patients, and the most common neurological manifestations concern the central nervous system, such as headache, fatigue, and brain fog. The activation of innate, humoral, and cellular immune responses, resulting in a cytokine storm and endothelial and mitochondrial dysfunctions, are the main pathophysiological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Citicoline is an exogenous source of choline and cytidine involved in intracellular phospholipid synthesis, which improves blood flow, brain activity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This report will present the case of a non-hospitalized, 59-year-old female. After a mild form of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the patient developed cognitive disturbances such as forgetfulness and anomia. The multidimensional neuropsychological assessment revealed an impairment in episodic memory with borderline performance in executive and visuospatial functioning. Cognitive rehabilitation and treatment with citicoline 1000 mg/daily led to a marked improvement in symptoms after six months. Early identification of the neurological sequelae of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and timely rehabilitation interventions are required in non-hospitalized long-hauler patients with COVID-19. Long-term treatment with citicoline should be considered as potentially effective in improving cognitive functioning in subjects with Post COVID-19 Neurological Syndrome.","2023","2023 Sep 01","Roberto Monastero; Roberta Baschi","Section of Neurology, Department of Biomedicine, Neuroscience and Advanced Diagnostics (BiND), University of Palermo, 90121 Palermo, Italy.; Section of Neurology, Department of Biomedicine, Neuroscience and Advanced Diagnostics (BiND), University of Palermo, 90121 Palermo, Italy."

A 36-year-old female presented to the National University of Natural Medicine Health Center with reactivated EBV-induced viral hepatitis. She reported severe fatigue, brain fog, maintenance and initiation insomnia, periocular hyperpigmentation, blurry vision, and decreased concentration. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed with a diagnostic evaluation of her EBV titers and liver enzymes, all of which were elevated. After assessing for contraindications, the patient was treated with intravenous (IV) vitamin C starting at a 10g dose and increasing weekly for 3 weeks to a dose of 25g. After 12 weeks of treatment with high dose IV vitamin C, as well as other immune-supportive nutrient therapy, the patient reported a decrease in fatigue severity, brain fog, vision disturbances, exercise limitations, and insomnia severity. We recommend that physicians consider the administration of high-dose IV vitamin C for all concurrent cases of EBV and hepatitis in both acute and chronic conditions. As recognition of reactivated viral infections grows, high-dose IV vitamin C for other latent viral infections such as COVID-19, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, varicella zoster, and HIV should be considered.","2023","2023 Sep","Adriane L Knorr; Ryan S Wexler; Leslie Fuller","National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM) Health Centers, Portland, OR.; National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM) Health Centers, Portland, O; Helfgott Research Institute at National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, OR.; National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM) Health Centers, Portland, OR; University of Western States, Portland, OR."

Cognitive symptoms during natural menopause transition are frequently reported; however, very few studies have examined cognitive changes following surgical menopause. To address this gap, we explored the cognitive experiences of women within 24 months post BSO. This observational cross-sectional sub-study is part of a larger project, the Early Menopause and Cognition Study (EM-COG). We investigated perceived cognitive experiences in Australian women (n = 16) who underwent risk-reducing BSO using qualitative interviews. Thematic analysis was undertaken to identify key themes. Fifteen out of 16 participants (93.75%) reported changes to cognition within 24 months post BSO. The key cognitive symptoms reported were brain fog, memory and retrieval difficulties, slower processing speed as well as attention difficulties. Five participants (31.3%) experienced negative mood symptoms post BSO. Findings from this study suggest that women experience subjective cognitive changes within 24 months post BSO. This period could be a vulnerable time for women's cognitive health. While these findings need to be confirmed by a large prospective study, our research indicates that psychoeducation and awareness will be helpful in managing cognitive symptoms after surgical menopause.","2023","2023 Dec","A Ramachandra; E H X Thomas; A J Vincent; M Hickey; N Warren; J Kulkarni; L E Forrest; J Bojadzieva; A Campbell; C Gurvich","HER Centre Australia, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; HER Centre Australia, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation (MCHRI), Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.; Women's Gynaecology Research Centre, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; School of Social Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; HER Centre Australia, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Parkville Familial Cancer Centre, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Clinical Genetics Unit, Austin Health, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Clinical Genetics Unit, Austin Health, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; HER Centre Australia, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia."

There are still no standardised diagnostic criteria or treatment approaches for managing LC. The LC-Optimal Health Programme (LC-OHP) was designed to support the mental wellbeing and physical health of people with LC. Gaining an in-depth understanding of patients' experiences and support strategies is imperative to identifying appropriate supports to guide them through their recovery. This study aimed to elicit the experiences and perceptions of adults with LC regarding symptoms, support strategies and the LC-OHP. As part of a wider randomised controlled trial of the LC-OHP, participants in the intervention group had their sessions audio-recorded. Transcripts were thematically analysed to identify common emergent themes. The LC-OHP was delivered to 26 participants. Data were collected between January 2022 and February 2023. Four main themes emerged: 'Symptoms and impact of LC'; 'Other sources of support and perceived challenges'; 'Strategies to support LC' and 'Perceptions of the LC-OHP'. LC experiences were mostly described as fluctuating and burdensome that significantly impacted daily activities, and physical and mental health. The LC-OHP was perceived as beneficial. Access and experiences of other sources of support were varied. Increasing LC awareness amongst health practitioners and the wider community has the potential to improve the experiences of those affected by LC. The LC-OHP was derived from the OHP. It was adapted to people with LC following consultation with practitioners at an LC clinic. Additionally, the mode and timing of delivering the programme to this population were taken into account for its delivery at the convenience of participating patients. While considering that fatigue and brain fog are amongst the most reported complaints of people with LC, public members with LC were not involved directly in this study; however, feedback obtained from practitioners working with this population was implemented in amending the programme and its delivery. Additionally, feedback from patients with other chronic health conditions who used the OHP in previous studies has been implemented to make the programme more user-friendly. Moreover, feedback obtained from participants receiving this programme in this study was implanted immediately and shared with other participants. Finally, this study was overviewed by a data management committee that included two public members with LC, who contributed and provided guidance to support this study.","2024","2024 Feb","Hiyam Al-Jabr; David R Thompson; David J Castle; Chantal F Ski","Primary Community and Social Care, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Keele, Keele, UK.; School of Nursing and Midwifery, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.; Centre for Mental Health Service Innovation, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.; School of Nursing and Midwifery, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK."

Social media platforms can generate valuable insights into patient-reported health outcomes as the content is produced at high resolution by patients and caregivers, representing experiences that may be unavailable to most clinicians. In this study, we aimed to determine the validity and effectiveness of advanced natural language processing approaches built to derive insight into PCC-related patient-reported health outcomes from social media platforms Twitter and Reddit. We extracted PCC-related terms, including symptoms and conditions, and measured their occurrence frequency. We compared the outputs with human annotations and clinical outcomes and tracked symptom and condition term occurrences over time and locations to explore the pipeline's potential as a surveillance tool. We used bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) models to extract and normalize PCC symptom and condition terms from English posts on Twitter and Reddit. We compared 2 named entity recognition models and implemented a 2-step normalization task to map extracted terms to unique concepts in standardized terminology. The normalization steps were done using a semantic search approach with BERT biencoders. We evaluated the effectiveness of BERT models in extracting the terms using a human-annotated corpus and a proximity-based score. We also compared the validity and reliability of the extracted and normalized terms to a web-based survey with more than 3000 participants from several countries. UmlsBERT-Clinical had the highest accuracy in predicting entities closest to those extracted by human annotators. Based on our findings, the top 3 most commonly occurring groups of PCC symptom and condition terms were systemic (such as fatigue), neuropsychiatric (such as anxiety and brain fog), and respiratory (such as shortness of breath). In addition, we also found novel symptom and condition terms that had not been categorized in previous studies, such as infection and pain. Regarding the co-occurring symptoms, the pair of fatigue and headaches was among the most co-occurring term pairs across both platforms. Based on the temporal analysis, the neuropsychiatric terms were the most prevalent, followed by the systemic category, on both social media platforms. Our spatial analysis concluded that 42% (10,938/26,247) of the analyzed terms included location information, with the majority coming from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The outcome of our social media-derived pipeline is comparable with the results of peer-reviewed articles relevant to PCC symptoms. Overall, this study provides unique insights into patient-reported health outcomes of PCC and valuable information about the patient's journey that can help health care providers anticipate future needs.

Neurologic manifestations of PASC (Neuro-PASC) are particularly debilitating, long lasting, and poorly understood. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of PASC, we leveraged a well-characterized group of Neuro-PASC (NP) patients seen at our Neuro-COVID-19 clinic who had mild acute COVID-19 and never required hospitalization to investigate their plasma proteome. Using the SomaLogic platform, SomaScan, the plasma concentration of >7000 proteins was measured from 92 unvaccinated individuals, including 48 NP patients, 20 COVID-19 convalescents (CC) without lingering symptoms, and 24 unexposed healthy controls (HC) to interrogate underlying pathobiology and potential biomarkers of PASC. We analyzed the plasma proteome based on post-COVID-19 status, neurologic and non-neurologic symptoms, as well as subjective and objective standardized tests for changes in quality-of-life (QoL) and cognition associated with Neuro-PASC. The plasma proteome of NP patients differed from CC and HC subjects more substantially than post-COVID-19 groups (NP and CC combined) differed from HC. Proteomic differences in NP patients 3-9 months following acute COVID-19 showed alterations in inflammatory proteins and pathways relative to CC and HC subjects. Proteomic associations with Neuro-PASC symptoms of brain fog and fatigue included changes in markers of DNA repair, oxidative stress, and neutrophil degranulation. Furthermore, we discovered a correlation between NP patients lower subjective impression of recovery to pre-COVID-19 baseline with an increase in the concentration of the oxidative phosphorylation protein COX7A1, which was also associated with neurologic symptoms and fatigue, as well as impairment in QoL and cognitive dysfunction. Finally, we identified other oxidative phosphorylation-associated proteins correlating with central nervous system symptoms. Our results suggest ongoing inflammatory changes and mitochondrial involvement in Neuro-PASC and pave the way for biomarker validation for use in monitoring and development of therapeutic intervention for this debilitating condition.","2023","2023 Nov","Barbara A Hanson; Lavanya Visvabharathy; Zachary S Orban; Millenia Jimenez; Ayush Batra; Eric M Liotta; Robert K DeLisle; Jeffrey D Klausner; Pinchas Cohen; Advait S Padhye; George Tachas; Igor J Koralnik","Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.; SomaLogic, Inc, Boulder, CO 80301, USA.; Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.; The Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.; Antisense Therapeutics Limited, Toorak, Victoria, Australia.; Antisense Therapeutics Limited, Toorak, Victoria, Australia.; Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.

Additionally, we aimed to identify patients with worsening autonomic symptoms at 6 and 12 months by dividing the patient cohort into two sub-groups: the Post-COVID healed Control sub-group (total score<16.4) and the Long-COVID autonomic syndrome sub-group (total score>16.4). This prospective cohort studied 112 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients discharged from Humanitas Research Hospital between January and March 2021. Autonomic symptoms and QoL were assessed using the composite autonomic symptom scale 31 (COMPASS-31) and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaires at various time points: before SARS-CoV-2 infection (PRE), at hospital discharge (T0), and at 1 (T1), 3 (T3), 6 (T6), and 12 (T12) months of follow-up. COMPASS-31 total score, Orthostatic Intolerance and Gastrointestinal function indices, QoL, physical functioning, pain, and fatigue scores worsened at T0 compared to PRE but progressively improved at T1 and T3, reflecting the acute phase of COVID-19.

We aimed to identify variables that distinguish IA from non-inflammatory arthropathy by performing a cross-sectional study of rheumatology referral letters and visit records. Further work describes time to assessment and documentation of variables within referral letters. We reviewed rheumatology referral letters and new patient visits over a 6-month period. The diagnosis of IA was based on the clinical judgement of the assessing rheumatologist. IA diagnoses included RA, SpAs, unspecified IA, PMR, crystalline arthropathies and remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting oedema. Univariate analysis was performed for each variable. Multivariable logistic regression was performed on statistically significant variables. Of 697 patients referred for arthralgia, 25.7% were diagnosed with IA. Variables predictive of IA included tenderness and swelling on examination and ≥1 h of morning stiffness. Increasing arthralgia duration, fatigue and brain fog were negative predictors. The median time from referral to IA diagnosis was 55 days and 20.7% of these patients were seen within 6 weeks. Among referral letters, documentation of arthralgia duration, morning stiffness or joint examination findings was uncommon (31%, 20.5% and 56.7%, respectively). We identified positive and negative predictors of IA. Referral letters often missed key information required for the triaging process. Future efforts will be directed towards build a triaging tool to improve the referral quality and capture of those patients with IA who need earlier access to rheumatology care.","2023","2023","Brendan L Thoms; Levi N Bonnell; Bradley Tompkins; Alana Nevares; ChiChi Lau","Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Robert Larner, MD College of Medicine at the University of Vermont and University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT, USA.; Department of General Internal Medicine Research, Robert Larner, MD College of Medicine at the University of Vermont and University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT, USA.; Quality Program, Department of Medicine, Robert Larner, MD College of Medicine at the University of Vermont and University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT, USA.; Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Robert Larner, MD College of Medicine at the University of Vermont and University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT, USA.; Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Robert Larner, MD College of Medicine at the University of Vermont and University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT, USA."

Most patients suffer residual symptoms, the so-called ""Long COVID,"" which includes respiratory and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Brain Fog, one of the symptoms of Long COVID, is a major public health issue because it can impair patients' quality of life even after recovery from the disease. However, neither the pathogenesis nor the treatment of this condition remains unknown. We focused on serum ferritin levels in this study and collected information on the onset of Brain Fog through questionnaires and found that high ferritin levels during hospitalization were associated with the occurrence of Brain Fog. In addition, we excluded confounders as far as possible using propensity score analyses and found that ferritin was independently associated with Brain Fog in most of the models. We conducted phase analysis and evaluated the interaction of each phase with ferritin levels and Brain Fog. We found a positive correlation between serum ferritin levels during hospitalization and Brain Fog after COVID-19. High ferritin levels in patients with Brain Fog may reflect the contribution of chronic inflammation in the development of Brain Fog. This study provides a novel insight into the pathogenic mechanism of Brain Fog after COVID-19.","2023","2023 Aug 11","Teruyuki Ishikura; Tomohito Nakano; Takaya Kitano; Takechiyo Tokuda; Hisae Sumi-Akamaru; Takashi Naka","Department of Neurology, Higashiosaka City Medical Center, 3-4-5 Nishiiwata, Higashiosaka, Osaka, 578-8588, Japan. t.ishikura@molneu.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.; Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan. t.ishikura@molneu.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.; Department of Neurology, Higashiosaka City Medical Center, 3-4-5 Nishiiwata, Higashiosaka, Osaka, 578-8588, Japan.; Department of Neurology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.; Krembil Research Institute, Toronto Western Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Neurology, Higashiosaka City Medical Center, 3-4-5 Nishiiwata, Higashiosaka, Osaka, 578-8588, Japan.; Department of Neurology, Higashiosaka City Medical Center, 3-4-5 Nishiiwata, Higashiosaka, Osaka, 578-8588, Japan.; Department of Neurology, Higashiosaka City Medical Center, 3-4-5 Nishiiwata, Higashiosaka, Osaka, 578-8588, Japan."

PCC is a multi-systems disease with neurocognitive impairment frequently reported regardless of age. Little is known about the risk factors, associated biomarkers and clinical trajectory of patients with this symptom. To determine differences in clinical risk factors, associated biochemical markers and longitudinal clinical trajectories between patients with PCC with subjective neurocognitive symptoms (NC+) or without (NC-). A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was performed using a well-characterized provincial database of patients with clinically confirmed PCC separated into NC+ and NC- cohorts. Demographical, clinical and biochemical differences at initial consultation between the two patient cohorts were analyzed in cross-section. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to identify independent risk factors for neurocognitive impairment. Determination of the recovery trajectory was performed using serial assessments of the patient-reported health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) metric Eq-5D-5L-vas score. Women, milder acute infection and pre-existing mental health diagnoses were independently associated with subjective neurocognitive impairment at 8 months post-infection. NC + patients demonstrated lower levels of IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 compared to NC- patients. The NC + cohort had poorer HR-QoL at initial consultation 8 months post-infection with gradual improvement over 20 months post-infection. Neurocognitive impairment represents a severe phenotype of PCC, associated with unique risk factors, aberrancy in immune response and a delayed recovery trajectory. Those with risk factors for neurocognitive impairment can be identified early in the disease trajectory for more intense medical follow-up.","2023","2023 Oct","Grace Y Lam; Ronald W Damant; Giovanni Ferrara; Rachel K Lim; Michael K Stickland; Natacha S Ogando; Christopher Power; Maeve P Smith","Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta and Alberta Health Services, 3-111C Clinical Sciences Building, 11302 83 Ave NW, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2G3, Canada. glam@ualberta.ca.; Alberta Respiratory Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada. glam@ualberta.ca.; Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta and Alberta Health Services, 3-111C Clinical Sciences Building, 11302 83 Ave NW, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2G3, Canada.; Alberta Respiratory Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta and Alberta Health Services, 3-111C Clinical Sciences Building, 11302 83 Ave NW, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2G3, Canada.; Alberta Respiratory Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; Division of Respiratory Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.; Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta and Alberta Health Services, 3-111C Clinical Sciences Building, 11302 83 Ave NW, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2G3, Canada.; Alberta Respiratory Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta and Alberta Health Services, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta and Alberta Health Services, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta and Alberta Health Services, 3-111C Clinical Sciences Building, 11302 83 Ave NW, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2G3, Canada.; Alberta Respiratory Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."

Cardiovascular manifestations of long-COVID include high heart rate, postural tachycardia, and palpitations. Previous studies have suggested that mast cell activation (MCA) may play a role in the pathophysiology of long-COVID, including in the mechanisms of its cardiovascular manifestations. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment with blockers of histamine receptors in patients with long-COVID who did not respond to other therapies. In all, 14 patients (F/M = 9/5; 49.5 ± 11.5 years) and 13 controls (F/M = 8/5; 47.3 ± 8.0 years) with long-COVID symptoms attributed to MCA were evaluated. Patients were treated with fexofenadine (180 mg/day) and famotidine (40 mg/day). Fatigue, brain fog, abdominal disorders, and increased heart rate were evaluated in treated and untreated patients at baseline and 20 days later. Long-COVID symptoms disappeared completely in 29% of treated patients. There was a significant improvement in each of the considered symptoms (improved or disappeared) in all treated patients, and the improvement grade was significantly greater in treated patients compared to controls. No significant differences in the outcomes were observed in the controls. Our data confirm that histamine receptors blockade may be an effective target to successfully treat long-COVID.

The onset of these diseases has also been linked to acute herpesvirus infections or their reactivations. In this work, we re-analyzed a previously-described dataset related to IgG antibody responses to 6 herpesviruses (CMV - cytomegalovirus; EBV - Epstein-Barr virus; HHV6 - human herpesvirus-6; HSV1 and HSV2 - herpes simplex virus-1 and -2, respectively; VZV - varicella-zoster virus) from the United Kingdom ME/CFS biobank. The primary goal was to report the underlying symptomology and its association with herpesvirus IgG antibodies using data from 4 disease-trigger-based subgroups of ME/CFS patients (n = 222) and patients with MS (n = 46). The secondary objective was to assess whether serological data could distinguish ME/CFS and its subgroup from MS using a SuperLearner (SL) algorithm. There was evidence for a significant negative association between temporary eye insight disturbance and CMV antibody concentrations and for a significant positive association between bladder problems and EBV antibody concentrations in the MS group. In the ME/CFS or its subgroups, the most significant antibody-symptom association was obtained for increasing HSV1 antibody concentration and brain fog, a finding in line with a negative impact of HSV1 exposure on cognitive outcomes in both healthy and disease conditions. There was also evidence for a higher number of significant antibody-symptom associations in the MS group than in the ME/CFS group. When we combined all the serological data in an SL algorithm, we could distinguish three ME/CFS subgroups (unknown disease trigger, non-infection trigger, and an infection disease trigger confirmed in the lab at the time of the event) from the MS group. However, we could not find the same for the remaining ME/CFS group (related to an unconfirmed infection disease). In conclusion, IgG antibody data explains more the symptomology of MS patients than the one of ME/CFS patients. Given the fluctuating nature of symptoms in ME/CFS patients, the clinical implication of these findings remains to be determined with a longitudinal study. This study is likely to ascertain the robustness of the associations during natural disease course.","2023","2023 Jul","Tiago Dias Domingues; João Malato; Anna D Grabowska; Ji-Sook Lee; Jose Ameijeiras-Alonso; Przemysław Biecek; Luís Graça; Helena Mouriño; Carmen Scheibenbogen; Francisco Westermeier; Luis Nacul; Jacqueline M Cliff; Eliana Lacerda; Nuno Sepúlveda","Departamento de Estatística e Investigação Operacional, Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.; Faculty of Mathematics & Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland.; Faculty of Mathematics & Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland.; Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.; Department of Biophysics, Physiology, And Pathophysiology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Statistics, Mathematical Analysis and Optimization, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.; Faculty of Mathematics & Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland.; Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.; Departamento de Estatística e Investigação Operacional, Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.; Faculty of Mathematics & Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland.; Institute of Medical Immunology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt Universität zu Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Health Studies, Institute of Biomedical Science, FH Joanneum University of Applied Sciences, Graz, Austria.; Centro Integrativo de Biología y Química Aplicada (CIBQA), Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins, Santiago, Chile.; Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.; BC Women's Hospital, Vancouver, BC V6H 3N1, Canada.; Department of Life Sciences and Centre for Inflammation Research and Translational Medicine, Brunel University London, United Kingdom.; Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.; Faculty of Mathematics & Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland.; Faculty of Mathematics & Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland."

Clinical care has been skewed toward the physical manifestations of the disease, yet a range of silent symptoms occurs including the cognitive aspects of MS. In a 2018 meeting of MS in the 21st Century (MS21), an international steering committee comprising both specialists and patient experts recognised that the 'invisible symptoms' of MS pose a significant challenge to patient engagement. These findings prompted the European Charcot Foundation (ECF) MS21 symposium (2020), where a panel consisting of two leading MS clinicians and an MS patient expert (who were all members of the MS21 steering group) gathered to discuss the impact of cognitive impairment on the everyday lives of people with MS.The perspectives and experiences of the panellists are summarised in this paper. The key points raised were that (1) the cognitive manifestations of MS are under-recognised and have consequently been undermanaged from a clinical perspective and (2) cognitive impairment due to MS has a significant impact upon daily living and patient quality of life. During discussions about how these challenges can be addressed, the panel advocated for an improvement in education about cognitive symptoms for people living with MS and healthcare professionals (HCPs) to raise awareness about this aspect of MS. Furthermore, the panel emphasised the importance of open and proactive communication between HCPs and their patients with MS about cognitive symptoms to reduce the stigma attached to these symptoms. In the opinion of the panel, future clinical trials which include cognitive outcomes as key endpoints are needed. Reflecting this point, cognitive impairment in MS care also needs to be treated as an important disease symptom, as is done with physical symptoms of the disease. Implementing early and routine cognition screening and promoting measures for protecting cognition to people living with MS, such as cognitive rehabilitation and a 'brain-healthy' lifestyle, are actions which can drive forward the recognition of cognitive impairment as a care priority.If prioritised as highly as physical disability in both the MS care and clinical drug development setting, and proactively discussed in conversations between HCPs and patients with MS, the 'invisibility' of cognitive impairment in MS can be lifted and a better quality of life can be promoted for people living with MS.","2023","2023 Oct","Sarah A Morrow; Paola Kruger; Dawn Langdon; Nektaria Alexandri","Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, Western University, London, ON, Canada.

Over fifty post (long)-COVID symptoms are described, including cognitive dysfunction (""brain fog"") precluding return to pre-COVID level of function, with rates twice as high in females. Additionally, the predominant demographic affected by these symptoms is younger and still in the workforce. Lack of ability to work, even for six months, has significant socio-economic consequences. This cognitive dysfunction is associated with impaired cerebral glucose metabolism, assessed using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), showing brain regions that are abnormal compared to age and sex matched controls. In other cognitive conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), typical patterns of cerebral glucose hypometabolism, frontal hypometabolism and cerebellar hypermetabolism are common. Similar FDG-PET changes have also been observed in post-COVID-19, raising the possibility of a similar etiology. Ketone bodies (B-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone) are produced endogenously with very low carbohydrate intake or fasting. They improve brain energy metabolism in the face of cerebral glucose hypometabolism in other conditions [mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD]. Long-term low carbohydrate intake or prolonged fasting is not usually feasible. Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) is an exogenous route to nutritional ketosis. Research has supported their efficacy in managing intractable seizures, and cognitive impairment in MCI and AD. We hypothesize that cerebral glucose hypometabolism associated with post COVID-19 infection can be mitigated with MCT supplementation, with the prediction that cognitive function would also improve. Although there is some suggestion that post COVID-19 cognitive symptoms may diminish over time, in many individuals this may take more than six months. If MCT supplementation is able to speed the cognitive recovery, this will impact importantly on quality of life. MCT is readily available and, compared to pharmaceutical interventions, is cost-effective. Research shows general tolerability with dose titration. MCT is a component of enteral and parenteral nutrition supplements, including in pediatrics, so has a long record of safety in vulnerable populations. It is not associated with weight gain or adverse changes in lipid profiles.

The symptoms include inattention, short-term memory loss, and reduced mental acuity, which may undermine cognition, concentration, and sleep. This cognitive impairment, persisting for weeks or months after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, can significantly impact on daily activities and the quality of life. An important role for the complement system (C) in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 has emerged since the beginning of pandemic outbreak. A number of pathophysiological characteristics including microangiopathy and myocarditis have been attributed to dysregulated C activation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL), the first recognition subcomponent of the C lectin pathway, has been shown to bind to glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, genetic variants of MBL2 are suggested to have an association with severe COVID-19 manifestations requiring hospitalization. In the present study, we evaluated MBL activity (lectin pathway activation) and levels in the sera of a cohort of COVID-19 patients, presenting brain fog or only hyposmia/hypogeusia as persistent symptoms, and compared them with healthy volunteers. We found significantly lower levels of MBL and lectin pathway activity in the sera of patients experiencing brain fog as compared to recovered COVID-19 patients without brain fog. Our data indicate that long COVID-associated brain fog can be listed among the variegate manifestations of increased susceptibility to infections and diseases contributed by MBL deficiency.","2023","2023","Roberta Bulla; Lucrezia Rossi; Giovanni Furlanis; Chiara Agostinis; Miriam Toffoli; Andrea Balduit; Alessandro Mangogna; Marco Liccari; Giorgia Morosini; Uday Kishore; Paolo Manganotti","Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.; Neurology Unit, Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, Cattinara University Hospital, ASUGI, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.; Neurology Unit, Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, Cattinara University Hospital, ASUGI, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.; Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.; Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Science, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.; Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.; Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.; Neurology Unit, Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, Cattinara University Hospital, ASUGI, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.; Department of Veterinary Medicine, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.; Neurology Unit, Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, Cattinara University Hospital, ASUGI, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy."

Majority of patients with PASC develop neurological disorders like brain fog, fatigue, mood swings, sleep disorders, loss of smell and test among others collectively called neuro-PASC. While the people living with HIV (PWH) do not have a higher risk of developing severe disease and mortality/morbidity due to COVID-19. As a large section of PWH suffered from HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), it is essential to understand the impact of neuro-PASC on people with HAND. In pursuit of this, we infected HIV/SARS-CoV-2 alone or together in primary human astrocytes and pericytes and performed proteomics to understand the impact of co-infection in the central nervous system. Primary human astrocytes and pericytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 or HIV or HIV + SARS-CoV-2. The concentration of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA in the culture supernatant was quantified using reverse transcriptase quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). This was followed by a quantitative proteomics analysis of mock, HIV, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV + SARS-CoV-2 infected astrocytes and pericytes to understand the impact of the virus in CNS cell types. Both healthy and HIV-infected astrocytes and pericytes support abortive/low level of SARS-CoV-2 replication. In both mono-infected and co-infected cells, we observe a modest increase in the expression of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry factors (ACE2, TMPRSS2, NRP1, and TRIM28) and inflammatory mediators (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-18). Quantitative proteomic analysis has identified uniquely regulated pathways in mock vs SARS-CoV-2, mock vs HIV + SARS-CoV-2, and HIV vs HIV + SARS-CoV-2 infected astrocytes and pericytes. The gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the top ten enriched pathways are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our study emphasizes the significance of long-term monitoring of patients co-infected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 to detect and understand the development of neurological abnormalities. By unraveling the molecular mechanisms involved, we can identify potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.","2023","2023 Jun 12","Arpan Acharya; Anoop T Ambikan; Michellie Thurman; Mohid Reza Malik; Shetty Ravi Dyavar; Ákos Végvári; Ujjwal Neogi; Siddappa N Byrareddy","University of Nebraska Medical Center.; Karolinska Institutet.; University of Nebraska Medical Center.; University of Nebraska Medical Center.; University of Nebraska Medical Center.; Karolinska Institutet.; Karolinska Institutet.; University of Nebraska Medical Center."

Covid-19 infection generally resolves within several weeks but some experience new or lingering symptoms. Though there is no formal definition for such lingering symptoms the CDC boadly describes long Covid as persons having a wide range of new, recurring or sustained health issues four or more weeks after first being infected with SARS-CoV2. The WHO defines long Covid as the manifestation of symptoms from a ""probable or confirmed"" Covid-19 infection that start approximately 3 months after the onset of the acute infection and last for more than 2 months. Numerous studies have looked at the implications of long Covid on various organs. Many specific mechanisms have been proposed for such changes. In this article, we provide an overview of some of the main mechanisms by which long Covid induces end-organ damage proposed in recent research studies. We also review various treatment options, current clinical trials, and other potential therapeutic avenues to control long Covid followed by the information about the effect of vaccination on long Covid. Lastly, we discuss some of the questions and knowledge gaps in the present understanding of long Covid. We believe more studies of the effects long Covid has on quality of life, future health and life expectancy are required to better understand and eventually prevent or treat the disease. We acknowledge the effects of long Covid are not limited to those in this article but as it may affect the health of future offspring and therefore, we deem it important to identify more prognostic and therapeutic targets to control this condition.","2023","2023","Farigol Hakem Zadeh; Daniel R Wilson; Devendra K Agrawal","Department of Translational Research, College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, California 91766, USA.; Department of Translational Research, College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, California 91766, USA.; Department of Translational Research, College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, California 91766, USA."

From a database of 363 patients, 83 cases aged 47 ± 15 years, (58% females) were selected from June to August 2020. In patients who survived the virus, 24 infection-related symptoms were collected to create three severity clusters (mild, moderate, and severe). The follow-up time was at least seven months. Comparing the first two clusters with the severe cluster, the existence of brain fog and risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and hypothyroidism) were analyzed. Thirty-one patients (37%) had persistent symptoms lasting up to 240 days. Fifty-one patients (61%) experienced brain fog. Concentration was affected by symptom severity (odds ratio [OR] 3.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26-10.46, p = 0.02). Short- or long-term memory loss was not affected. Moreover, symptom severity was related to brain fog (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.05-9.51, p = 0.04).

A 50-year-old woman, ten-weeks post-COVID syndrome, participated in an examination that revealed deficits in exercise capacity, strength, breathing pattern, mild depression, emotional breakdown, and mild anxiety accompanied by ""brain fog"" with activity. Her primary complaint was fatigue with ordinary activities around her home that impeded her from returning to work. On examination, scores included six-minute walk test distance (6MWD): 79.5 m, UCSD Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (SOBQ): 72/120, and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9): 6/27. The patient participated in 20 biweekly sessions with a focus on patient education, supporting emotional health, aerobic training, strengthening exercises, breathing exercises, and home exercise program. At discharge, the patient's exercise capacity, muscle strength, dyspnea, and depression improved, beyond the MCID/MID values, 6MWD: 335 m, SOBQ: 34/120; and PHQ-9 :1/27. The patient had no anxiety with activity and reported confidence to resume activities, allowing her to return to work safely. Following an intervention that addressed emotional needs with physical symptoms, our patient with post-COVID fatigue showed substantial improvements in exercise capacity, muscle strength, dyspnea, and depression.

The data presented here include prospectively collected 156 outpatients from May 2021 to April 2022. Patients underwent semistandardized interviewing about symptoms with reported onset after SARS-CoV-2 infection, neurological examination, and comprehensive diagnostic workup. Reported new onset symptoms after infection included fatigue (77.6%), subjective cognitive impairment (72.4%), headache (47.7%), loss of smell and/or taste (43.2%), and sleep disturbances (42.2%). Most patients had a mild coronavirus disease (COVID-19) disease course (84%) and reported comorbidities (71%), of which the most frequent were psychiatric disorders (34%). Frequency of symptoms was not associated with age, sex, or severity of COVID-19 course. A comprehensive diagnostic workup revealed no neurological abnormalities in the clinical examination, or electrophysiological or imaging assessments in the majority of patients (n = 143, 91.7%). Neuropsychological assessment of a subgroup of patients (n = 28, 17.9%) showed that cognitive impairments in executive functions and attention, anxiety, depression, and somatization symptoms were highly common. In this systematic registry, we identified fatigue, cognitive impairment, and headache as the most frequently reported persisting complaints after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Structural neurological findings were rare. We also suspect a link between the growing burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on personal lives and the increase in reported neurological and psychiatric complaints.","2023","2023 Sep","Birgit Ludwig; Matthias Deckert; Nik Krajnc; Omar Keritam; Stefan Macher; Gabriel Bsteh; Gudrun Zulehner; Majda Thurnher; Thomas Berger; Stefan Seidel; Ulrike Willinger; Paulus Rommer","Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neurosciences & Mental Health, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neurosciences & Mental Health, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neurosciences & Mental Health, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neurosciences & Mental Health, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neurosciences & Mental Health, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neurosciences & Mental Health, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neurosciences & Mental Health, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Section of Neuroradiology and Musculoskeletal Radiology, Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-Guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neurosciences & Mental Health, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neurosciences & Mental Health, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Rehabilitation Clinic Pirawarth, Bad Pirawarth, Austria.; Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neurosciences & Mental Health, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neurosciences & Mental Health, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."

Characterizing PASC requires analysis of prospectively and uniformly collected data from diverse uninfected and infected individuals. To develop a definition of PASC using self-reported symptoms and describe PASC frequencies across cohorts, vaccination status, and number of infections. Prospective observational cohort study of adults with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection at 85 enrolling sites (hospitals, health centers, community organizations) located in 33 states plus Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. Participants who were enrolled in the RECOVER adult cohort before April 10, 2023, completed a symptom survey 6 months or more after acute symptom onset or test date. Selection included population-based, volunteer, and convenience sampling. SARS-CoV-2 infection. PASC and 44 participant-reported symptoms (with severity thresholds). A total of 9764 participants (89% SARS-CoV-2 infected; 71% female; 16% Hispanic/Latino; 15% non-Hispanic Black; median age, 47 years [IQR, 35-60]) met selection criteria. Adjusted odds ratios were 1.5 or greater (infected vs uninfected participants) for 37 symptoms. Symptoms contributing to PASC score included postexertional malaise, fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, gastrointestinal symptoms, palpitations, changes in sexual desire or capacity, loss of or change in smell or taste, thirst, chronic cough, chest pain, and abnormal movements. Among 2231 participants first infected on or after December 1, 2021, and enrolled within 30 days of infection, 224 (10% [95% CI, 8.8%-11%]) were PASC positive at 6 months. A definition of PASC was developed based on symptoms in a prospective cohort study. As a first step to providing a framework for other investigations, iterative refinement that further incorporates other clinical features is needed to support actionable definitions of PASC.","2023","2023 Jun 13","Tanayott Thaweethai;

Recently, noninvasive transcutaneous electrical brain stimulation techniques have been showing early signs of success in addressing some of these complaints. We postulate that the use of a stimulation technique with transcranial magnetic stimulation may also similarly be effective. A 36-year-old male suffering from symptoms of dyspnea, anosmia, and ""brain fog"" for 2 years following coronavirus infection was treated with 10 sessions of Electro-Magnetic Brain Pulse (EMBP®), a personalized transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol guided by the patient's electroencephalograph (EEG). At the conclusion of the treatment, the patient had improvements in mood, sense of smell, and brain fogging. Dyspnea also decreased with a gain of 11% forced expiratory volume 1/forced vital capacity. A high-sensitivity athletic training cognitive test showed an overall 27% increase in aggregate score. A significant portion of this was attributed to changes in visual clarity and decision-making speed. Post-treatment EEG showed a shift from predominantly delta waves to more synchronized alpha wave patterns during the resting state. Brain stimulation techniques appear to be showing early signs of success with long-COVID symptoms. This is the first case describing the use of a magnetic stimulation technique with quantitative test results and recorded EEG changes. Given the early success in this patient with cognition, dyspnea, and anosmia, this noninvasive treatment modality warrants further research.","2023","2023 Nov 03","Joe X Zhang; Jianzhong J Zhang","A3TH-Aircrew Performance Branch, Air Combat Command, JBLE, VA 23665, USA.; 55th Aerospace Medicine Squadron, 55th Medical Group, Offutt AFB, NB 68113, USA."

We conducted an exploratory, observational single-center cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from November 2020 to March 2022. Our primary outcome was persistent neurocognitive symptoms, defined as fatigue, headache, loss of taste/smell, brain fog, confusion, concentration/memory/word finding difficulty, and/or change in speech present at 1-month and persisting for 6-months following acute SARS-CoV2 infection. Secondary outcomes included persistent impairment scores on PROMIS cognitive function and abilities scales. Multivariate logistic regression analyses identified potential risk factors for neuro-PASC. Of 89 participants, 60% reported persistent neurocognitive symptoms at 6-months; fatigue was the most prevalent, occurring in 53% of participants, followed by brain fog in 34% of participants. Lower self-reported socioeconomic status and increased pre-COVID-19 anxiety scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were associated with increased odds of developing persistent neurocognitive symptoms. Being female and of Hispanic descent were associated with increased odds of persistent cognitive function and ability impairment. Sociodemographic factors and pre-COVID-19 anxiety symptoms may be important risk factors for neuro-PASC. These findings underscore the need to assess various sociodemographic factors in research on PASC. Our study also highlights premorbid mental health symptoms as a potential predictor of persistent neurocognitive symptoms following hospitalization with SARS-CoV2 infection.","2023","2023 Jul","Peter Y Ch'en; Laura S Gold; Qiongshi Lu; Ting Ye; James S Andrews; Payal Patel","Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA.; Department of Radiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Department of Statistics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."

Long-term longCOVID brain fog (BF) prevalence, risk factors and associated medical/functional factors are poorly understood, especially after mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted at an urban tertiary-care hospital.

The causes of these syndromes and the reason for their frequent association are not yet fully understood. We previously published a comprehensive hypothesis of the ME/CFS pathophysiology that explains the majority of symptoms, findings and chronicity of the disease. We wondered whether some of the identified key pathomechanisms in ME/CFS are also operative in MCA, endometriosis and dysmenorrhea, POTS, decreased cerebral blood flow and SFN, and possibly may provide clues on their causes and frequent co-occurrence. Our analysis indeed provides strong arguments in favor of this assumption, and we conclude that the main pathomechanisms responsible for this association are excessive generation and spillover into the systemic circulation of inflammatory and vasoactive tissue mediators, dysfunctional β2AdR, and the mutual triggering of symptomatology and disease initiation.

Many patients with ME/CFS experience orthostatic intolerance (OI), which is characterized by frequent dizziness, light-headedness, and feeling faint while maintaining an upright posture. Despite intense investigation, the molecular mechanism of this debilitating condition is still unknown. OI is often manifested by cardiovascular alterations, such as reduced cerebral blood flow, reduced blood pressure, and diminished heart rate. The bioavailability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzyme, is tightly coupled with cardiovascular health and circulation. To explore the role of BH4 in ME/CFS, serum samples of CFS patients (n = 32), CFS patients with OI only (n = 10; CFS + OI), and CFS patients with both OI and small fiber polyneuropathy (n = 12; CFS + OI + SFN) were subjected to BH4 ELISA. Interestingly, our results revealed that the BH4 expression is significantly high in CFS, CFS + OI, and CFS + OI + SFN patients compared to age-/gender-matched controls. Finally, a ROS production assay in cultured microglial cells followed by Pearson correlation statistics indicated that the elevated BH4 in serum samples of CFS + OI patients might be associated with the oxidative stress response. These findings suggest that the regulation of BH4 metabolism could be a promising target for understanding the molecular mechanism of CFS and CFS with OI.","2023","2023 May 13","Carl Gunnar Gottschalk; Ryan Whelan; Daniel Peterson; Avik Roy","Simmaron Research Institute, 948 Incline Way, Incline Village, NV 89451, USA.; Simmaron Research and Development Laboratory, Chemistry Building, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 3210 N Cramer Street, Suite # 214, Milwaukee, WI 53211, USA.; Simmaron Research Institute, 948 Incline Way, Incline Village, NV 89451, USA.; Simmaron Research Institute, 948 Incline Way, Incline Village, NV 89451, USA.; Sierra Internal Medicine, 920 Incline Way, Incline Village, NV 89451, USA.; Simmaron Research Institute, 948 Incline Way, Incline Village, NV 89451, USA.; Simmaron Research and Development Laboratory, Chemistry Building, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 3210 N Cramer Street, Suite # 214, Milwaukee, WI 53211, USA."

The aim of this study was to assess whether neurocognitive function could improve after a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program enhanced with individualized neuropsychological treatment. A prospective monocentric registry of PACS patients consecutively admitted to our Rehabilitation Unit was created. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess cognitive impairment at admission and discharge. A total of sixty-four (64) PACS patients, fifty-six (56) of them with brain fog, were treated with a day-by-day individualized psychological intervention of cognitive stimulation (45 min) on top of a standard in-hospital rehabilitation program. The mean duration of the acute-phase hospitalization was 55.8 ± 25.8 days and the mean in-hospital rehabilitation duration was 30 ± 10 days. The mean age of the patients was 67.3 ± 10.4 years, 66% of them were male, none had a previous diagnosis of dementia, and 66% of the entire sample had experienced severe COVID-19. At admission, only 12% of the patients had normal cognitive function, while 57% showed mild, 28% moderate, and 3% severe cognitive impairment. After psychological treatment, a significant improvement in the MoCA score was found (20.4 ± 5 vs. 24.7 ± 3.7; p < 0.0001) as a result of significant amelioration in the following domains: attention task (p = 0.014), abstract reasoning (p = 0.003), language repetition (p = 0.002), memory recall (p < 0.0001), orientation (p < 0.0001), and visuospatial abilities (p < 0.0001). Moreover, the improvement remained significant after multivariate analysis adjusted for several confounding factors. Finally, at discharge, 43% of the patients with cognitive impairment normalized their cognitive function, while 4.7% were discharged with residual moderate cognitive impairment. In conclusion, our study provides evidence of the effects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation enhanced with neuropsychological treatment on improvement in the cognitive function of post-acute COVID-19 patients.","2023","2023 May 12","Paolo Rabaiotti; Chiara Ciracì; Davide Donelli; Carlotta Oggioni; Beatrice Rizzi; Federica Savi; Michele Antonelli; Matteo Rizzato; Luca Moderato; Valerio Brambilla; Valentina Ziveri; Lorenzo Brambilla; Matteo Bini; Antonio Nouvenne; Davide Lazzeroni","Prevention and Rehabilitation Unit, Parma, IRCCS Fondazione Don Gnocchi, Piazzale Servi, 3, 43100 Parma, Italy.; Prevention and Rehabilitation Unit, Parma, IRCCS Fondazione Don Gnocchi, Piazzale Servi, 3, 43100 Parma, Italy.; Division of Cardiology, University Hospital of Parma, University of Parma, Viale Antonio Gramsci, 14, 43126 Parma, Italy.; Prevention and Rehabilitation Unit, Parma, IRCCS Fondazione Don Gnocchi, Piazzale Servi, 3, 43100 Parma, Italy.; Prevention and Rehabilitation Unit, Parma, IRCCS Fondazione Don Gnocchi, Piazzale Servi, 3, 43100 Parma, Italy.; Prevention and Rehabilitation Unit, Parma, IRCCS Fondazione Don Gnocchi, Piazzale Servi, 3, 43100 Parma, Italy.; Department of Public Health, AUSL-IRCCS of Reggio Emilia, Via Amendola, 42122 Reggio Emilia, Italy.; ""Humandive"", Piazzale XX Settembre, 1/B, 33170 Pordenone, Italy.; Cardiology Department, ""Guglielmo da Saliceto"" Hospital, Via Taverna Giuseppe, 49, 29121 Piacenza, Italy.; Prevention and Rehabilitation Unit, Parma, IRCCS Fondazione Don Gnocchi, Piazzale Servi, 3, 43100 Parma, Italy.; Prevention and Rehabilitation Unit, Parma, IRCCS Fondazione Don Gnocchi, Piazzale Servi, 3, 43100 Parma, Italy.; IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi, Via Carlo Girola, 30, 20162 Milano, Italy.; Prevention and Rehabilitation Unit, Parma, IRCCS Fondazione Don Gnocchi, Piazzale Servi, 3, 43100 Parma, Italy.; U.O.

Increased inflammatory factors and neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as cognitive impairment (""brain fog""), depression, and anxiety are associated with long COVID [post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), termed neuro-PASC]. The present study sought to examine the role of inflammatory factors as predictors of neuropsychiatric symptom severity in the context of COVID-19. Adults (n = 52) who tested negative or positive for COVID-19 were asked to complete self-report questionnaires and to provide blood samples for multiplex immunoassays. Participants who tested negative for COVID-19 were assessed at baseline and at a follow-up study visit (∼4 weeks later). Individuals without COVID-19 reported significantly lower PHQ-4 scores at the follow-up visit, as compared to baseline (p = 0.03; 95% CI-1.67 to -0.084). Individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 and experienced neuro-PASC had PHQ-4 scores in the moderate range. The majority of people with neuro-PASC reported experiencing brain fog (70% vs. 30%). Those with more severe COVID-19 had significantly higher PHQ-4 scores, as compared to those with mild disease (p = 0.008; 95% CI 1.32 to 7.97). Changes in neuropsychiatric symptom severity were accompanied by alterations in immune factors, particularly monokine induced by gamma interferon (IFN-γ) (MIG, a. k.a. CXCL9). These findings add to the growing evidence supporting the usefulness of circulating MIG levels as a biomarker reflecting IFN-γ production, which is important because individuals with neuro-PASC have elevated IFN-γ responses to internal SARS-CoV-2 proteins.","2023","2023 Aug","Jennifer M Loftis; Evan Firsick; Kate Shirley; James L Adkins; Anh Le-Cook; Emily Sano; Rebekah Hudson; Jonathan Moorman","Research & Development Service, VA Portland Health Care System, 3710 SW US Veterans Hospital Road, Portland, OR, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Oregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR, USA.; Clinical Psychology PhD Program, Oregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR, USA.; Department of Behavioral Neuroscience, Oregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR, USA.; Research & Development Service, VA Portland Health Care System, 3710 SW US Veterans Hospital Road, Portland, OR, USA.; Research & Development Service, VA Portland Health Care System, 3710 SW US Veterans Hospital Road, Portland, OR, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Oregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR, USA.; Clinical Psychology PhD Program, Oregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR, USA.; Research Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, James H.

We have evidence from other conditions associated with central nervous system inflammation that hypoxia may occur in the brain. If so, hypoxia could reduce the quality of life and brain function. This study was undertaken to assess if brain hypoxia occurs in individuals after recovery from acute COVID-19 infection and if this hypoxia is associated with neurocognitive impairment and reduced quality of life. Using frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (fdNIRS), we measured cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) (a measure of hypoxia) in participants who had contracted COVID-19 at least 8 weeks prior to the study visit and healthy controls. We also conducted neuropsychological assessments and health-related quality of life assessments, fatigue, and depression. Fifty-six percent of the post-COVID-19 participants self-reported having persistent symptoms (from a list of 18), with the most reported symptom being fatigue and brain fog. There was a gradation in the decrease of oxyhemoglobin between controls, and normoxic and hypoxic post-COVID-19 groups (31.7 ± 8.3 μM, 27.8 ± 7.0 μM and 21.1 ± 7.2 μM, respectively, p = 0.028, p = 0.005, and p = 0.081).

We believe that the hypoxia reported here will have health consequences for these individuals, and this is reflected in the correlation of hypoxia with greater symptomology.

The role of early viral kinetics in the subsequent development of long COVID is largely unknown, especially in individuals who were not hospitalized for acute COVID-19. Seventy-three non-hospitalized adult participants were enrolled within approximately 48 hours of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, and mid-turbinate nasal and saliva samples were collected up to 9 times within the first 45 days after enrollment. Samples were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR and additional SARS-CoV-2 test results were abstracted from the clinical record. Each participant indicated the presence and severity of 49 long COVID symptoms at 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-months post-COVID-19 diagnosis. Time from acute COVID-19 illness onset to SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance greater or less than 28 days was tested for association with the presence or absence of each of 49 long COVID symptoms at 90+ days from acute COVID-19 symptom onset. Self-reported brain fog and muscle pain at 90+ days after acute COVID-19 onset were negatively associated with viral RNA clearance within 28 days of acute COVID-19 onset with adjustment for age, sex, BMI ≥ 25, and COVID vaccination status prior to COVID-19 (brain fog: aRR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22-0.95; muscle pain: aRR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08-0.94). Participants reporting higher severity brain fog or muscle pain at 90+ days after acute COVID-19 onset were less likely to have cleared SARS-CoV-2 RNA within 28 days. The acute viral RNA decay trajectories of participants who did and did not later go on to experience brain fog 90+ days after acute COVID-19 onset were distinct. This work indicates that at least two long COVID symptoms - brain fog and muscle pain - at 90+ days from acute COVID-19 onset are specifically associated with prolonged time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from the upper respiratory tract during acute COVID-19. This finding provides evidence that delayed immune clearance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen or greater amount or duration of viral antigen burden in the upper respiratory tract during acute COVID-19 are directly linked to long COVID. This work suggests that host-pathogen interactions during the first few weeks after acute COVID-19 onset have an impact on long COVID risk months later.","2023","2023","Annukka A R Antar; Tong Yu; Zoe O Demko; Chen Hu; Jeffrey A Tornheim; Paul W Blair; David L Thomas; Yukari C Manabe","Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Austere environments Consortium for Enhanced Sepsis Outcomes (ACESO), Henry M.

The goal of this study was to determine whether symptoms and comorbidities overlap in patients diagnosed with hEDS/HSD and/or fibromyalgia. We retrospectively examined self-reported data from an EDS Clinic intake questionnaire in patients diagnosed with hEDS/HSD, fibromyalgia, or both vs. controls with an emphasis on joint issues. From 733 patients seen at the EDS Clinic, 56.5% (n = 414) were diagnosed with hEDS/HSD and fibromyalgia (Fibro), 23.8% (n = 167) hEDS/HSD, 13.3% (n = 98) fibromyalgia, or 7.4% (n = 54) none of these diagnoses. More patients were diagnosed with HSD (76.6%) than hEDS (23.4%). Patients were primarily White (95%) and female (90%) with a median age in their 30s (controls 36.7 [18.0, 70.0], fibromyalgia 39.7 [18.0, 75.0], hEDS/HSD 35.0 [18.0, 71.0], hEDS/HSD&Fibro 31.0 [18.0, 63.0]). There was high overlap in all 40 symptoms/comorbidities that we examined in patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia only or hEDS/HSD&Fibro, regardless of whether they had hEDS or HSD. Patients that only had hEDS/HSD without fibromyalgia had far fewer symptoms/comorbidities than patients with hEDS/HSD&Fibro. The top self-reported issues in patients that only had fibromyalgia were joint pain, hand pain when writing or typing, brain fog, joint pain keeping from daily activities, allergy/atopy and headache. Five issues that significantly and uniquely characterized patients diagnosed with hEDS/HSD&Fibro were subluxations (dislocations in hEDS patients), joint issues like sprains, the need to stop sports due to injuries, poor wound healing, and migraine. The majority of patients seen at the EDS Clinic had a diagnosis of hEDS/HSD plus fibromyalgia that was associated with more severe disease. Our findings indicate that fibromyalgia should be routinely assessed in patients with hEDS/HSD and vis-a-versa to improve patient care.","2023","2023","DeLisa Fairweather; Katelyn A Bruno; Ashley A Darakjian; Barbara K Bruce; Jessica M Gehin; Archana Kotha; Angita Jain; Zhongwei Peng; David O Hodge; Todd D Rozen; Bala Munipalli; Fernando A Rivera; Pedro A Malavet; Dacre R T Knight","Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.; Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.; Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.; Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States."

We aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a virtual Coping with Brain Fog intervention among YAs with cancer. Our secondary aims were to explore the intervention's effect on cognitive functioning and psychological distress. Methods: This prospective feasibility study involved eight weekly, 90-minute virtual group sessions. Sessions focused on psychoeducation on CRCD, memory skills, task management, and psychological well-being. The primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability of the intervention evaluated through attendance (>60% not missing >2 consecutive sessions) and satisfaction (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [CSQ] score >20). Secondary outcomes included the following: cognitive functioning (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function [FACT-Cog] Scale) and symptoms of distress (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Short Form-Anxiety/Depression/Fatigue) and participants' experiences using semistructured interviews. Paired t-tests and summative content analysis were used for quantitative and qualitative data analyses. Results: Twelve participants (five male, mean age = 33 years) were enrolled. All but one participant met feasibility criteria of not missing >2 consecutive sessions (11/12 = 92%). The mean CSQ score was 28.1 (standard deviation 2.5). Significant improvement in cognitive function as measured by FACT-Cog Scale was observed postintervention (p < 0.05). Ten participants adopted strategies from the program to combat CRCD, and eight reported CRCD symptom improvement. Conclusion: A virtual Coping with Brain Fog intervention is feasible and acceptable for the symptoms of CRCD among YAs with cancer. The exploratory data indicate subjective improvement in cognitive function, and will inform the design and implementation of a future clinical trial.

We aimed to investigate if individuals who received three doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines had a lower incidence of (a) medical complaints and (b) COVID-19-related medical complaints, both as seen in primary care, when compared to individuals who received two doses. We conducted a daily longitudinal exact one-to-one matching study based on a set of covariates. We obtained a matched sample of 315,650 individuals aged 18-70 years who received the 3rd dose at 20-30 weeks after the 2nd dose and an equally large control group who did not. Outcome variables were diagnostic codes as reported by general practitioners or emergency wards, both alone and in combination with diagnostic codes of confirmed COVID-19. For each outcome, we estimated cumulative incidence functions with hospitalization and death as competing events. We found that the number of medical complaints was lower in individuals aged 18-44 years who received three doses compared to those who received two doses. The differences in estimates per 100,000 vaccinated were as follows: fatigue 458 less (95% confidence interval: 355-539), musculoskeletal pain 171 less (48-292), cough 118 less (65-173), heart palpitations 57 less (22-98), shortness of breath 118 less (81-149), and brain fog 31 less (8-55). We also found a lower number of COVID-19-related medical complaints: per 100,000 individuals aged 18-44 years vaccinated with three doses, there were 102 (76-125) fewer individuals with fatigue, 32 (18-45) fewer with musculoskeletal pain, 30 (14-45) fewer with cough, and 36 (22-48) fewer with shortness of breath. There were no or fewer differences in heart palpitations (8 (1-16)) or brain fog (0 (- 1-8)). We observed similar results, though more uncertain, for individuals aged 45-70 years, both for medical complaints and for medical complaints that were COVID-19 related.

Using a mixed methods study design, we aimed to gain insight into individuals' experience with PASC, including cognitive issues, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. We explored whether our previously developed application (app), aimed at improving self-management skills among individuals with chronic diseases, is relevant for individuals with PASC and gained information to adapt the app for individuals with PASC. The study included 19 individuals, aged 40 years and older, recruited from our research participant database, Nova Southeastern University clinics, and community locations. We included this age range because older adults are more likely to have comorbid conditions, allowing us to better understand the impact of COVID-19 infection in these individuals. Participants completed seven standardized self-report questionnaires online, and an individual semi-structured interview via videoconferencing. Quantitative data were assessed using descriptive statistics and calculating individuals' scores in relation to norms. Qualitative data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Triangulation of the data was accomplished by calculating correlations between participants' responses on self-report scales and themes found in semi-structured interviews. Themes included disruption of everyday life, diverse physical symptoms, and cognitive problems including brain fog, fatigue, coping, and emotional upset. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that participants experienced high levels of fatigue, negative mood, cognitive problems, and overall reduction in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Correlation analyses revealed that individual interview responses were related to participants' self-report of symptoms on standard questionnaires.

The etiology of self-reported BII is unknown. Some patients have limited resolution of symptoms despite implant removal, and the mechanism of persistent symptoms is unclear. Notably, there are a number of prevalent, chronic systemic illnesses and other factors which present with the most common physical symptoms of self-reported BII. Fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune disorders, and hypothyroidism often produce fatigue, joint and muscle pain, ""brain fog,"" anxiety or depression, and hair loss in affected patients who may or may not have breast implants. Other factors such as anxiety with or without depression, perimenopause, aging, cigarette smoking/marijuana use, and prominent side effects from common medications are known to produce similar symptoms as those reported by patients concerned with BII. The possibility that patients with breast implants have an undiagnosed, chronic illness unrelated to breast implants should be considered as well as other factors which may produce similar symptoms. Plastic surgeons should be aware of the range of illnesses and factors which can produce physical symptoms similar to those of patients with self-reported BII. For patients in which a systemic illness or other factor is felt to play a contributory role to self-reported BII symptoms, referral to an internist or rheumatologist for a thorough history and physical examination to rule out conditions may be prudent before explantation. This may reduce the need for explantation if the etiology of systemic symptoms is found to be unrelated to breast implants.","2023","2023","Stephen D Bresnick",""

Pearson χ 2 and Fisher exact tests were used to determine associations between cancer, postdischarge mortality, and long COVID symptoms. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders were used to quantify the risk of death between patients with and without cancer. The cancer cohort had higher mortality after hospitalization (23% vs 5%, P < 0.001), a hazard ratio of 4.7 (95% CI: 2.34-9.46) for all-cause mortality, after adjusting for smoking and oxygen requirement.

Here, we propose a description of the pathophysiology of the Long COVID presentation based on inflammatory cytokine cascades and the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways that regulate cytokine production. In this model, the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection is hypothesized to trigger a dysregulated peripheral immune system activation with subsequent cytokine release. Chronic low-grade inflammation leads to dysregulated brain microglia with an exaggerated release of central cytokines, producing neuroinflammation. Immunothrombosis linked to chronic inflammation with microclot formation leads to decreased tissue perfusion and ischemia. Intermittent fatigue, Post Exertional Malaise (PEM), CNS symptoms with ""brain fog,"" arthralgias, paresthesias, dysautonomia, and GI and ophthalmic problems can consequently arise as result of the elevated peripheral and central cytokines. There are abundant similarities between symptoms in Long COVID and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). DNA polymorphisms and viral-induced epigenetic changes to cytokine gene expression may lead to chronic inflammation in Long COVID patients, predisposing some to develop autoimmunity, which may be the gateway to ME/CFS.","2023","2023","Russell N Low; Ryan J Low; Athena Akrami","Retired, La Jolla, CA, United States.; Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, University College London, London, United Kingdom."

In this case report, a 72-year-old, fully vaccinated patient without pre-existing somatic or mental illnesses, or other relevant risk factors was diagnosed with long COVID. Nine months following an acute COVID-19 infection, the patient's depressive symptoms improved, but memory and concentration difficulties persisted, and the patient remains unable to resume work. These long-term symptoms are possibly linked to micro-hemorrhages detected during examinations of the patient's brain following COVID-19 infection.

Mast cell activation diseases (MCADs) include primary, secondary and idiopathic conditions, especially mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), but mast cells are activated in many other disorders making the diagnosis and treatment challenging. Mast cells can release numerous biologically active mediators, some of which are prestored in secretory granules while others are newly synthesized and released without degranulation. Most of the emphasis has so far been on secretion of histamine and tryptase, which do not explain all the multisystemic symptoms experienced by patients with MCADs. As a result, drug development has focused on antiproliferative therapy or blocking the action of individual mediators and not on inhibitors of mast cell activation. Activated mast cells are involved in the pathogenesis of MCADs, but also in other disorders making appropriate diagnosis and treatment challenging.

We aimed to co-produce a feasibility study of non-pharmacological interventions to support people with Long COVID. A consensus workshop on research prioritisation was conducted with patients and other stakeholders. This was followed by the co-production of the feasibility trial with a group of patient partners, which included the design of the study, the selection of interventions, and the production of dissemination strategies. The consensus workshop was attended by 23 stakeholders, including six patients. The consensus from the workshop was to develop a clinical trial platform that focused on testing different pacing interventions and resources. For the co-production of the feasibility trial, patient partners selected three pacing resources to evaluate (video, mobile application, and book) and co-designed feasibility study processes, study materials and undertook usability testing of the digital trial platform.

Eighteen LC patients (mean age 53; s.d. = 7), 12 patients diagnosed with MCI (mean age 67; s.d. = 6), and 10 healthy control subjects (mean age 66; s.d. = 5, 7) were recruited for this exploratory study. All of them performed a chemosensory event-related potentials (CSERP) task with the administration of trigeminal stimulations (e.g., the odorants cinnamaldehyde and eucalyptus). Study results highlighted that MCI and LC showed reduced N1 amplitude, particularly in the left frontoparietal network, involved in working memory and attentional deficits, and a reduction of P3 latency in LC. This study lays the foundations for evaluating aspects of LC as a process that could trigger long-term functional alterations, and CSERPs could be considered valid biomarkers for assessing the progress of OD and an indicator of other impairments (e.g., attentional and cognitive impairments), as they occur in MCI.","2023","2023 Mar 19","Sara Invitto; Paolo Boscolo-Rizzo; Francesco Fantin; Domenico Marco Bonifati; Cosimo de Filippis; Enzo Emanuelli; Daniele Frezza; Federico Giopato; Marcella Caggiula; Andrea Schito; Vincenzo Ciccarese; Giacomo Spinato","INSPIRE Lab, Laboratory on Cognitive and Psychophysiological Olfactory Processing, DiSTeBA, University of Salento, 73100 Lecce, Italy.; Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, Section of Otolaryngology, University of Trieste, 34123 Trieste, Italy.; Department of Neuroscience DNS, Audiology Unit at Treviso Hospital, University of Padova, 31100 Treviso, Italy.; Unit of Neurology, Department of Neuro-Cardio-Vascular, Ca' Foncello Hospital, 31100 Treviso, Italy.; Department of Neuroscience DNS, University of Padova, Audiology and Phoniatrics Unit, Ca' Foncello Hospital, 31100 Treviso, Italy.; Otolaringology Unit, Ca' Foncello Hospital, Local Health Unit N.2 ""Marca Trevigiana"", 31100 Treviso, Italy.; Otolaringology Unit, Ca' Foncello Hospital, Local Health Unit N.2 ""Marca Trevigiana"", 31100 Treviso, Italy.; Unit of Neurology, Department of Neuro-Cardio-Vascular, Ca' Foncello Hospital, 31100 Treviso, Italy.; Neurology Unit, Vito Fazzi Hospital, 73100 Lecce, Italy.; INSPIRE Lab, Laboratory on Cognitive and Psychophysiological Olfactory Processing, DiSTeBA, University of Salento, 73100 Lecce, Italy.; Istituto Santa Chiara, 73100 Lecce, Italy.; Istituto Santa Chiara, 73100 Lecce, Italy.; Department of Neuroscience DNS, Section of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy."

A multitude of symptoms have been described under the umbrella term ‘Long COVID’, otherwise known as ‘post-COVID syndrome’ or ‘post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC)’; for simplicity we will use the term Long COVID. Symptoms are diverse but include breathlessness, fatigue and brain fog, reported to affect up to 69% of cases [3]. Long COVID can be debilitating, 45.2% of patients requiring a reduced work schedule [4]. The WHO estimates that 17 million people in Europe have experienced Long COVID during the first two years of the pandemic [5]. SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to circulate and the risk of post-acute complications remains; a recent study of 56 003 UK patients found that even after Omicron infection, 4.5% suffered persistent symptoms [6]. It is therefore likely that Long COVID will provide a substantial medical and economic burden for the foreseeable future. There is an urgent need to understand mechanisms of disease and develop effective treatments based on this understanding.","2023","2023 May","Felicity Liew; Claudia Efstathiou; Peter J M Openshaw","National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK.; National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK.; National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK p.openshaw@imperial.ac.uk."

Among them, the neuropsychiatric manifestations characterized by a short-term memory loss and inability to concentrate are called ""brain fog"". Recent studies have revealed the involvement of ""chronic neuro-inflammation"" in the pathogenesis of brain fog following COVID-19 infection. In the COVID-related brain fog, similarly to neurodegenerative disorders caused by neuro-inflammation, brain leukocytes, such as microglia and lymphocytes, are hyperactivated, suggesting the overexpression of delayed rectifier K+-channels (Kv1.3) within the cells. In our previous patch-clamp studies, drugs, such as antihistamines, statins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics and anti-hypertensive drugs, suppressed the Kv1.3-channel activity and reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, newer generation antihistamines, antibiotics and corticosteroids strongly stabilize mast cells that directly activate microglia in the brain. Taking such pharmacological properties of these commonly used drugs into account, they may be useful in the treatment of COVID-related brain fog, in which the enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses are responsible for the pathogenesis.","2023","2023 Aug","Itsuro Kazama","School of Nursing, Miyagi University, 1-1 Gakuen, Taiwa-Cho, Kurokawa-Gun, Miyagi, 981-3298, Japan. kazamai@myu.ac.jp."

The pulmonary function pattern is consistent with restrictive defects, which, in most cases, are self-resolved, while the cognitive profile may be impaired. Rehabilitation is an ongoing field for holistic management of long-post-COVID-19 patients. Virtual reality (VR) applications may represent an innovative implementation of rehabilitation. We aimed to investigate the effect of exercise with and without the VR system and to assess further breathlessness and functional fitness indicators in long-post-COVID-19 patients with mild cognitive impairment after self-selected exercise duration using the VR system. Twenty long-post-COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study (age: 53.9 ± 9.1 years, male: 80%, body mass index: 28.1 ± 3.1 kg/m2). Participants' anthropometric data were recorded, and they underwent pulmonary functional test evaluation as well as sleep quality and cognitive assessment. The participants randomly exercised with and without a VR system (VR vs. no-VR) and, later, self-selected the exercise duration using the VR system. The results showed that exercise with VR resulted in a lower dyspnea score than exercise without VR. In conclusion, VR applications seem to be an attractive and safe tool for implementing rehabilitation. They can enhance performance during exercise and benefit patients with both respiratory and cognitive symptoms.","2023","2023","Vasileios T Stavrou; George D Vavougios; Periklis Kalogiannis; Konstantinos Tachoulas; Evlalia Touloudi; Kyriaki Astara; Dimitrios S Mysiris; Glykeria Tsirimona; Eirini Papayianni; Stylianos Boutlas; Mary Hassandra; Zoe Daniil; Yannis Theodorakis; Konstantinos I Gourgoulianis","Laboratory of Cardio-Pulmonary Testing and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Respiratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.; Laboratory of Cardio-Pulmonary Testing and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Respiratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.; Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cyprus, Lefkosia, Cyprus.; Laboratory of Cardio-Pulmonary Testing and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Respiratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.; Laboratory of Cardio-Pulmonary Testing and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Respiratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.; Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences, University of Thessaly, Trikala, Greece.; Laboratory of Cardio-Pulmonary Testing and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Respiratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.; Department of Neurology, 417 Army Equity Fund Hospital, Medical Institution Military Shareholder Fund (NIMTS), Athens, Greece.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.; Laboratory of Cardio-Pulmonary Testing and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Respiratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.; Laboratory of Cardio-Pulmonary Testing and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Respiratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.; Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences, University of Thessaly, Trikala, Greece.; Laboratory of Cardio-Pulmonary Testing and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Respiratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.; Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences, University of Thessaly, Trikala, Greece.; Laboratory of Cardio-Pulmonary Testing and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Respiratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece."

However, the impact on the already demented brain has not been studied. We aimed to assess the cognitive functioning and neuroimaging following SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with pre-existing dementia. Fourteen COVID-19 survivors with pre-existing dementia (four with Alzheimer's disease, five with vascular dementia, three with Parkinson's disease dementia, and two with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia) were recruited. All these patients had detailed cognitive and neuroimaging evaluations within three months before suffering from COVID-19 and one year later. Of the 14 patients, ten required hospitalization. All developed or increased white matter hyperintensities that mimicked multiple sclerosis and small vessel disease. There was a significant increase in fatigue (p = 0.001) and depression (p = 0.016) scores following COVID-19. The mean Frontal Assessment Battery (p < 0.001) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (p = 0.001) scores also significantly worsened. The rapid progression of dementia, the addition of further impairments/deterioration of cognitive abilities, and the increase or new appearance of white matter lesion burden suggest that previously compromised brains have little defense to withstand a new insult (i.e., 'second hit' like infection/dysregulated immune response, and inflammation). 'Brain fog' is an ambiguous terminology without specific attribution to the spectrum of post-COVID-19 cognitive sequelae.

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study at hospitals in southern India. Seventy adults with functional gas and bloating with a gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) indigestion score ≥ 5 were randomized to receive B coagulans MTCC 5856 (2 billion spores/day, N = 35) or placebo (N = 35) for 4 weeks. Changes in the GSRS-Indigestion subscale score for gas and bloating and global evaluation of patient's scores from screening to the final visit were the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were Bristol stool analysis, brain fog questionnaire, changes in other GSRS subscales, and safety. Two participants from each group withdrew from the study and 66 participants (n = 33 in each group) completed the study. The GSRS indigestion scores changed significantly (P < .001) in the probiotic group (8.91-3.06; P < .001) compared to the placebo (9.42-8.43; P = .11).

The maximum magnitude of the third wave of COVID-19 in Poland was in April 2021. The research referred here aimed at carrying out the investigation comprising the electrophysiological analysis of the patients who suffered from COVID-19 and had symptoms of brain fog (sub-cohort A), suffered from COVID-19 and did not have symptoms of brain fog (sub-cohort B), and the control group that had no COVID-19 and no symptoms (sub-cohort C). The aim of this article was to examine whether there are differences in the brain cortical activity of these three sub-cohorts and, if possible differentiate and classify them using the machine-learning tools. he dense array electroencephalographic amplifier with 256 electrodes was used for recordings. The event-related potentials were chosen as we expected to find the differences in the patients' responses to three different mental tasks arranged in the experiments commonly known in experimental psychology: face recognition, digit span, and task switching. These potentials were plotted for all three patients' sub-cohorts and all three experiments. The cross-correlation method was used to find differences, and, in fact, such differences manifested themselves in the shape of event-related potentials on the cognitive electrodes. The discussion of such differences will be presented; however, an explanation of such differences would require the recruitment of a much larger cohort. In the classification problem, the avalanche analysis for feature extractions from the resting state signal and linear discriminant analysis for classification were used. The differences between sub-cohorts in such signals were expected to be found. Machine-learning tools were used, as finding the differences with eyes seemed impossible. Indeed, the A&B vs. C, B&C vs. A, A vs. B, A vs. C, and B vs. C classification tasks were performed, and the efficiency of around 60-70% was achieved. In future, probably there will be pandemics again due to the imbalance in the natural environment, resulting in the decreasing number of species, temperature increase, and climate change-generated migrations. The research can help to predict brain fog after the COVID-19 recovery and prepare the patients for better convalescence. Shortening the time of brain fog recovery will be beneficial not only for the patients but also for social conditions.","2023","2023","Grzegorz M Wojcik; Oren Shriki; Lukasz Kwasniewicz; Andrzej Kawiak; Yarden Ben-Horin; Sagi Furman; Krzysztof Wróbel; Bernadetta Bartosik; Ewelina Panas","Department of Neuroinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Computer Science, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University in Lublin, Lublin, Poland.; Department of Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.; Department of Computer Science, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.; Department of Neuroinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Computer Science, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University in Lublin, Lublin, Poland.; Department of Neuroinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Computer Science, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University in Lublin, Lublin, Poland.; Department of Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.; Department of Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.; Department of Neuroinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Computer Science, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University in Lublin, Lublin, Poland.; Department of Neuroinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Computer Science, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University in Lublin, Lublin, Poland.; Department of International Relations, Faculty of Political Science and Journalism, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University in Lublin, Lublin, Poland."

In addition to pain, the disorder presents with a broad range of symptoms, such as sleep disruption, chronic fatigue, brain fog, depression, muscle stiffness, and migraine. FM has a considerable female prevalence, and it has been shown that symptoms are influenced by the menstrual cycle and periods of significant hormonal and immunological changes. There is increasing evidence that females with FM experience an aggravation of symptoms in pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester and after childbirth. In this perspective paper, we focus on the neuro-endocrine interactions that occur between progesterone, allopregnanolone, and cortisol during pregnancy, and propose that they align with our previously proposed model of FM pathogenesis based on GABAergic ""weakening"" in a thalamocortical neural loop system.

Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) is defined as signs and symptoms that develop during or after acute COVID-19 infection. This is a prospective observational cohort with repetitive measurements. The study followed RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19-positive survivors discharged from HAHC Hospital, New Delhi, for a period of 12 weeks. The patients were interviewed over the phone at 4 weeks and 12 weeks from the onset of symptoms for evaluation of clinical symptoms and health-related quality of life parameters. A total of 200 patients completed the study. At the baseline, 50% of the patients were categorised as severe based on their acute infection assessment. At 12 weeks after symptom onset, fatigue (23.5%), hair loss (12.5%) and dyspnea (9%) were the main persistent symptoms. The incidence of hair loss (12.5%), memory loss (4.5%) and brain fog (5%) were found to be increased as compared to the acute infection period. Severity of the acute COVID infection behaved as an independent predictor for the development of PCS, with high odds of experiencing persistent cough (OR = 13.1), memory loss (OR = 5.2) and fatigue (OR = 3.3). Further, 30% of subjects in the severe group experienced statistically significant fatigue at 12 weeks (p < .05). From the results of our study, it can be concluded that there is a huge disease burden of post-COVID Syndrome (PCS). The PCS comprised multisystem symptoms ranging from serious complaints of dyspnea, memory loss and brain fog to non-serious complaints of fatigue and hair loss. Severity of the acute COVID infection behaved as an independent predictor for the development of PCS. Our findings strongly recommend vaccination against COVID-19, for protection from disease severity as well as prevention of PCS. The findings of our study support the multidisciplinary approach required for the management of PCS with a team comprising of physicians, nurses, physiotherapists and psychiatrists working in close coordination for the rehabilitation of these patients. As nurses are considered the most trusted professionals in the community and the class of health workers associated with rehabilitation, focus should be given to educating them on PCS, which would prove to be an important strategy for efficient monitoring and long-term management of COVID-19 survivors.","2024","2024 Jan","Vineet Jain; Nusrat Nabi; Sanjana Aggarwal; Zaara Alam; Kailash Chandra; Dharmander Singh; Varun Kashyap; Farzana Islam; Sunil Kohli","Department of Medicine, Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and associated HAHC Hospital, New Delhi, India.; Department of Pharmacology, Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and associated HAHC Hospital, New Delhi, India.; Department of Medicine, Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and associated HAHC Hospital, New Delhi, India.; Department of Medicine, Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and associated HAHC Hospital, New Delhi, India.; Department of Biochemistry, Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and associated HAHC Hospital, New Delhi, India.; Department of Medicine, Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and associated HAHC Hospital, New Delhi, India.; Department of Community Medicine, Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and associated HAHC Hospital, New Delhi, India.; Department of Community Medicine, Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and associated HAHC Hospital, New Delhi, India.; Department of Medicine, Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and associated HAHC Hospital, New Delhi, India."

Long COVID is assumed to be a complex condition arising from multiple causes, including persistent brainstem dysfunction and disrupted vagal signaling. We recommend the potential application of auricular transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (atVNS) as an ADD-ON instrument to compensate for the cognitive decline and to ameliorate affective symptoms caused by long COVID. This technique enhances vagal signaling by directly activating the nuclei in the brainstem, which are hypoactive in long COVID to enhance mood and to promote attention, memory, and cognitive control-factors affected by long COVID. Considering that atVNS is a non-pharmacological intervention, its ADD-ON to standard pharmaceutical agents will be useful for non-responders, making of this method a suitable tool.

We consider the major unknowns, the limitations of electronic health records for research in this area, and the use of additional approaches to help characterize and understand the neuropsychiatric burden of COVID-19.","2023","2023 Jun 01","Paul J Harrison; Maxime Taquet","Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK.; Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, Warneford Hospital, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK.; Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, Warneford Hospital, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK."

TCS is surgically treatable and often found in conjunction with other syndromic conditions. KBG syndrome is caused by variants in the ANKRD11 gene and is characterized by short stature, developmental delay, macrodontia, and a triangular face. The current study explores the prevalence of TCS in pediatric KBG patients and their associated signs and symptoms. Patients with KBG were surveyed for signs and symptoms associated with TCS and asked if they had been diagnosed with the syndrome. We found a high proportion of patients diagnosed with (11%) or being investigated for TCS (24%), emphasizing the need to further characterize the comorbid syndromes. No signs or symptoms clearly emerged as indicative of TCS in KBG patients, but some the prevalence of some signs and symptoms varied by sex. Male KBG patients with diagnosed TCS were more likely to have coordination issues and global delay/brain fog than their female counterparts. Understanding the presentation of TCS in KBG patients is critical for timely diagnosis and treatment.","2023","2023 May","Sonia Hills; Alisa Pugacheva; Patricia Weltin; Annette Maughan; Sarah U Morton; Henry A Feldman; Petra M Klinge; Pankaj B Agrawal","Division of Newborn Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.; Beyond the Diagnosis, Rumford, Rhode Island, USA.; KBG Foundation, Manchester, Maryland, USA.; Division of Newborn Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Institutional Centers for Clinical and Translational Research, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Neurosurgery, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.; Division of Newborn Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; The Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Division of Genetics and Genomics, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."

The ACTIV-2 COVID-19 Symptom Diary (ACSD) is being used in the ongoing Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines-2 (ACTIV-2) platform clinical trial. The purpose of the current study was to conduct qualitative interviews to assess content validity of the ACSD. Interviews were conducted with adults who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The ACSD begins with global items, followed by a symptom checklist. Each interview began with concept elicitation focusing on participant experiences with COVID-19. Then, participants completed the ACSD, and cognitive interviews were conducted to evaluate the questionnaire. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded following a qualitative content analysis. For the qualitative analysis, a coding dictionary was developed with a list of all potential codes and instructions for how the codes should be applied and combined. Interviews were conducted with 30 participants (mean age = 39 years; 57% female; 17% Latinx; 17% Black/African American; 40% meeting at least one criterion for classification as high risk of progression to severe COVID-19). Commonly reported symptoms included fatigue (reported by 100% of the sample), body pain/muscle pain/aches (87%), headaches (87%), cough (83%), loss of smell (73%), shortness of breath/difficulty breathing (70%), and chills (70%). The 13 symptoms most commonly reported in this study are included in the ACSD. After completing the ACSD, participants consistently reported that it was clear and easy to complete, and all items were generally interpreted as intended. Based on participants' input, the ACSD was edited slightly after the first 13 interviews, and the revised version was used for the final 17 interviews. Two additional items assessing ""brain fog"" and dizziness were recommended for addition to the ACSD in future research. This qualitative study supports the content validity of the ACSD for assessment of COVID-19 symptoms. Quantitative research with larger samples will be needed to examine the questionnaire's measurement properties.","2023","2023 Jan 31","Louis S Matza; Katie D Stewart; April N Naegeli; Kayla M Mills; Karin S Coyne; Kara W Chew; Michael D Hughes; Davey M Smith","Evidera, Bethesda, MD, USA. louis.matza@evidera.com.; Evidera, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA.; Formerly of Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA.; Evidera, Bethesda, MD, USA.; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Harvard T.H.

The pathobiological mechanisms of long COVID and the role of early viral kinetics in its development are largely unknown. Seventy-three non-hospitalized adult participants were enrolled within approximately 48 hours of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, and mid-turbinate nasal and saliva samples were collected up to 9 times within the first 45 days after enrollment. Samples were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR and additional test results were abstracted from the clinical record. Each participant indicated the presence and severity of 49 long- COVID symptoms at 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-months post-COVID-19 diagnosis. Time from acute COVID-19 illness onset to SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance greater or less than 28 days was tested for association with the presence or absence of each of 49 long COVID symptoms at 90+ days from acute COVID-19 symptom onset. Brain fog and muscle pain at 90+ days after acute COVID-19 onset were negatively associated with viral RNA clearance within 28 days of acute COVID-19 onset with adjustment for age, sex, BMI ≥ 25, and COVID vaccination status prior to COVID-19 (brain fog: aRR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22-0.95; muscle pain: aRR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08-0.94). This work indicates that at least two long COVID symptoms - brain fog and muscle pain - at 90+ days from acute COVID-19 onset are specifically associated with longer time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from the upper respiratory tract.","2023","2023 Jan 19","Annukka A R Antar; Tong Yu; Zoe O Demko; Chen Hu; Jeffrey A Tornheim; Paul W Blair; David L Thomas; Yukari C Manabe; ",""

These symptoms can last over 2 years. Whilst there is limited controlled studies on interventions that can support those with ongoing symptoms, there has been some promise in rehabilitation interventions in improving function and symptoms either using face-to-face or digital methods, but evidence remains limited and these studies often lack a control group. This is a nested single-blind, parallel group, randomised control trial with embedded qualitative evaluation comparing rehabilitation (face-to-face or digital) to usual care and conducted within the PHOSP-COVID study. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions on exercise capacity, quality of life and symptoms such as breathlessness and fatigue. The primary outcome is the Incremental Shuttle Walking Test following the eight week intervention phase. Secondary outcomes include measures of function, strength and subjective assessment of symptoms. Blood inflammatory markers and muscle biopsies are an exploratory outcome. The interventions last eight weeks and combine symptom-titrated exercise therapy, symptom management and education delivered either in a face-to-face setting or through a digital platform ( www.yourcovidrecovery.nhs.uk ). The proposed sample size is 159 participants, and data will be intention-to-treat analyses comparing rehabilitation (face-to-face or digital) to usual care. Ethical approval was gained as part of the PHOSP-COVID study by Yorkshire and the Humber Leeds West Research NHS Ethics Committee, and the study was prospectively registered on the ISRCTN trial registry (ISRCTN13293865). Results will be disseminated to stakeholders, including patients and members of the public, and published in appropriate journals. Strengths and limitations of this study • This protocol utilises two interventions to support those with ongoing symptoms of COVID-19 • This is a two-centre parallel-group randomised controlled trial • The protocol has been supported by patient and public involvement groups who identified treatments of symptoms and activity limitation as a top priority.","2023","2023 Jan 26","Enya Daynes;

Our objective was to determine the utility of the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) to assess the frequency and severity of common symptoms of ME/CFS, to diagnose and monitor symptoms in patients with PASC. This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled 185 people that included 34 patients with PASC that had positive COVID-19 test and persistent symptoms of >3 months and 151 patients diagnosed with ME/CFS. PASC patients were followed over 1 year and responded to the DSQ at baseline and 12 months. ME/CFS patients responded to the DSQ at baseline and 1 year later. Changes in symptoms over time were analyzed using a fixed-effects model to compute difference-in-differences estimates between baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments. Patients were defined as having PASC if they had a previous positive COVID-19 test, were experiencing symptoms of fatigue, post-exertional malaise, or other unwellness for at least 3 months, were not hospitalized for COVID-19, had no documented major medical or psychiatric diseases prior to COVID-19, and had no other active and untreated disease processes that could explain their symptoms. PASC patients were recruited in 2021. ME/CFS patients were recruited in 2017. At baseline, patients with PASC had similar symptom severity and frequency as patients with ME/CFS and satisfied ME/CFS diagnostic criteria. ME/CFS patients experienced significantly more severe unrefreshing sleep and flu-like symptoms. Five symptoms improved significantly over the course of 1 year for PASC patients including fatigue, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, irritable bowel symptoms and feeling unsteady. In contrast, there were no significant symptom improvements for ME/CFS patients. There were considerable similarities between patients with PASC and ME/CFS at baseline. However, symptoms improved for PASC patients over the course of a year but not for ME/CFS patients. PASC patients with significant symptom improvement no longer met ME/CFS clinical diagnostic criteria. These findings indicate that the DSQ can be used to reliably assess and monitor PASC symptoms.","2022","2022","Carlos R Oliveira; Leonard A Jason; Derya Unutmaz; Lucinda Bateman; Suzanne D Vernon","Section of Infectious Diseases and Global Health, Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.; Section of Health Informatics, Department of Biostatistics, Yale University School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, United States.; Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, United States.; The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, United States.; Bateman Horne Center, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.; Bateman Horne Center, Salt Lake City, UT, United States."

The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there are indicators of central sensitization by using experimental pain measurements and to determine their association with patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). A cross-sectional study including 42 patients after COVID-19 infection was conducted. The central sensitization inventory (CSI) was administered as a PROM to evaluate central-sensitization-associated symptoms. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT), temporal summation, and descending nociceptive pain inhibition (CPM) were assessed as experimental pain measurements. The median score on the CSI was 46.5 (Q1-Q3: 33-54). The presence of central-sensitization-associated symptoms was seen in 64.3% of patients based on the CSI (≥40/100 points). A deficient CPM was seen in 12% and 14% of patients when measured at the trapezius and rectus femoris, respectively. A negative correlation between pressure sensitivity on the rectus femoris and the CSI score (r = -0.36, 95%CI -0.13 to -0.65, p = 0.007) was observed. Central-sensitization-associated symptoms were present in up to 64.3% of patients post-COVID-19 infection, based on a PROM, i.e., the CSI. A more objective evaluation of nociceptive processing through experimental pain measurements was less suggestive of indicators of central sensitization. Only a small negative correlation between pressure sensitivity and the CSI was observed, thereby pointing towards the discrepancy between the CSI and experimental pain measurements and presumably the complementary need for both to evaluate potential indicators of central sensitization in this population.","2023","2023 Jan 13","Lisa Goudman; Ann De Smedt; Stijn Roggeman; César Fernández-de-Las-Peñas; Samar M Hatem; Marc Schiltz; Maxime Billot; Manuel Roulaud; Philippe Rigoard; Maarten Moens","STIMULUS Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Neurosurgery, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Center for Neurosciences (C4N), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Pain in Motion (PAIN) Research Group, Department of Physiotherapy, Human Physiology and Anatomy, Faculty of Physical Education and Physiotherapy, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Research Foundation Flanders (FWO), Egmontstraat 5, 1000 Brussels, Belgium.; STIMULUS Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Center for Neurosciences (C4N), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, 28922 Alcorcón, Spain.; Center for Neuroplasticity and Pain (CNAP), SMI, Department of Health Science and Technology, Faculty of Medicine, Aalborg University, 9220 Aalborg, Denmark.; STIMULUS Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; STIMULUS Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; PRISMATICS Lab (Predictive Research in Spine/Neuromodulation Management and Thoracic Innovation/Cardiac Surgery), Poitiers University Hospital, 86021 Poitiers, France.; PRISMATICS Lab (Predictive Research in Spine/Neuromodulation Management and Thoracic Innovation/Cardiac Surgery), Poitiers University Hospital, 86021 Poitiers, France.; PRISMATICS Lab (Predictive Research in Spine/Neuromodulation Management and Thoracic Innovation/Cardiac Surgery), Poitiers University Hospital, 86021 Poitiers, France.; Department of Spine Surgery & Neuromodulation, Poitiers University Hospital, 86021 Poitiers, France.; Pprime Institute UPR 3346, CNRS, ISAE-ENSMA, University of Poitiers, 86360 Chasseneuil-du-Poitou, France.; STIMULUS Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Neurosurgery, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Center for Neurosciences (C4N), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Pain in Motion (PAIN) Research Group, Department of Physiotherapy, Human Physiology and Anatomy, Faculty of Physical Education and Physiotherapy, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Radiology, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090 Brussels, Belgium."

We found no hypometabolism in frontal, limbic and cerebellar regions in cognitively impaired relative to cognitive intact patients. In contrast, the cognitive impaired patients showed higher cerebellar metabolism (p = 0.03), which correlated with more severe deficits in working memory and executive function (p = 0.03).

Patients experiencing cognitive symptoms such as ""brain fog"" and other neurologic sequelae for 8 or more weeks define ""long haulers"". There is limited information regarding damage to grey matter (GM) structures occurring in COVID-19 ""long haulers"". Advanced imaging techniques can quantify brain volume depletions related to COVID-19 infection which is important as conventional Brain MRI often fails to identify disease correlates. 3-dimensional voxel-based morphometry (3D VBM) analyzes, segments and quantifies key brain volumes allowing comparisons between COVID-19 ""long haulers"" and normative data drawn from healthy controls, with values based on percentages of intracranial volume. This is a retrospective single center study which analyzed 24 consecutive COVID-19 infected patients with long term neurologic symptoms. Each patient underwent Brain MRI with 3D VBM at median time of 85 days following laboratory confirmation. All patients had relatively mild respiratory symptoms not requiring oxygen supplementation, hospitalization, or assisted ventilation. 3D VBM was obtained for whole brain and forebrain parenchyma, cortical grey matter (CGM), hippocampus, and thalamus. The results demonstrate a statistically significant depletion of CGM volume in 24 COVID-19 infected patients. Reduced CGM volume likely influences their long term neurological sequelae and may impair post COVID-19 patient's quality of life and productivity. This study contributes to understanding effects of COVID-19 infection on patient's neurocognitive and neurological function, with potential for producing serious long term personal and economic consequences, and ongoing challenges to public health systems.","2023","2023 Jan 17","Ted L Rothstein","Department of Neurology, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA. trothstein@mfa.gwu.edu."

Long post-COVID vaccination syndrome (LPCVS) is one of them and is often neglected. It persists 11 months after the third mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine dose has not been reported. Our patient is a 39-year-old male with a largely uneventful previous history who developed severe adverse reactions immediately after the third dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. In addition to brief fever, headache, flickering eyes, skin rashes, tiredness, disorientation, dizziness (brain fog), tiredness, impaired thinking and concentration, and emotional disorders occurred as a result. Cerebral MRI showed non-specific white matter lesions in a frontotemporal distribution. Some of the immune parameters were deflected. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines, sartans, and statins have occasionally provided temporary relief. In conclusion, LPCVS is a definite complication of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations and can severely impact the quality of life and lead to disability. Despite extensive work-up, a clear cause for the long-term neuro-cognitive deficits cannot be identified. Symptomatic treatment can provide some relief.

Until recently, there was no published research on the effects of controlled exposure to mold stimuli on cognitive function or an obvious mechanism of action, fueling controversy over these claims. The constellation of health problems reported by mold-exposed individuals (respiratory issues, fatigue, pain, anxiety, depression, and cognitive deficits) correspond to those caused by innate immune activation following exposure to bacterial or viral stimuli. To determine if mold-induced innate immune activation might cause cognitive issues, we quantified the effects of both toxic and nontoxic mold on brain immune activation and spatial memory in the Morris water maze. We intranasally administered either 1) intact, toxic Stachybotrys chartarum spores; 2) ethanol-extracted, nontoxic Stachybotrys chartarum spores; or 3) control saline vehicle to mice. Inhalation of nontoxic spores caused significant deficits in the test of long-term memory of platform location, while not affecting short-term memory. Inhalation of toxic spores increased motivation to reach the platform. Interestingly, in both groups of mold-exposed males, numbers of interleukin-1β-immunoreactive cells in many areas of the hippocampus significantly correlated with latency to find the platform, path length, and swimming speed during training, but not during testing for long-term memory. These data add to our prior evidence that mold inhalation can interfere with cognitive processing in different ways depending on the task, and that brain inflammation is significantly correlated with changes in behavior.","2023","2023 Mar 28","Cheryl F Harding; David Liao; Ramona Persaud; Richard A DeStefano; Kimberly G Page; Lauren L Stalbow; Tina Roa; Jordan C Ford; Ksenia D Goman; Carolyn L Pytte","Department of Psychology, Hunter College, CUNY, 695 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA; Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Doctoral Program, The Graduate Center, CUNY, 365 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA.

Unsurprisingly, COVID‑19 may also be accompanied by medium- and long‑term clinical sequelae after recovering from a SARS‑CoV‑2 infection. Although many clinical definitions have been provided, ""long‑COVID"" can be defined as a condition occurring in patients with a history of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection, developing 3 months from the symptoms onset, persisting for at least 2 months, and not explained by alternative diagnoses. According to recent global analyses, the cumulative prevalence of long‑COVID seems to range between 9% and 63%, and is up to 6‑fold higher than that of similar postviral infection conditions. Long‑COVID primarily encompasses the presence of at least 1 symptom, such as fatigue, dyspnea, cognitive impairment / brain fog, postexertional malaise, memory issues, musculoskeletal pain / spasms, cough, sleep disturbances, tachycardia / palpitations, altered smell / taste perception, headache, chest pain, and depression. The most important demographic and clinical predictors to date are female sex, older age, cigarette smoking, pre‑existing medical conditions, lack of COVID‑19 vaccination, infection with pre‑Omicron SARS‑CoV‑2 variants, number of acute phase symptoms, viral load, severe / critical COVID‑19 illness, as well as invasive mechanical ventilation. Concerning the care for long‑COVID patients, the greatest challenge is the fact that this syndrome cannot be considered a single clinical entity, and thus it needs an integrated multidisciplinary management, specifically tailored to the type and severity of symptoms.","2023","2023 Apr 19","Giuseppe Lippi; Fabian Sanchis-Gomar; Brandon M Henry","Section of Clinical Biochemistry and School of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. giuseppe.lippi@univr.it; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States; Clinical Laboratory, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States"

Available cognitive assessment tools are too time consuming for day-to-day clinical setting assessments. Importantly, although shorter, screening tools such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment or the Mini-Mental State Evaluation have demonstrated a ceiling effect in persons with cancer, and thus fail to detect subtle cognitive changes expected in patients with CRCI. This study addresses this lack of cognitive screening tools by developing a novel tool, the Fast Cognitive Evaluation (FaCE).A population of 245 patients with 11 types of cancer at different illness and treatment time-points was enrolled for the analysis. FaCE was developed using Rasch Measurement Theory, a model that establishes the conditions for a measurement tool to be considered a rating scale.FaCE shows excellent psychometric properties. The population size was large enough to test the set of items (item-reliability-index=0.96). Person-reliability (0.65) and person-separation (1.37) indexes indicate excellent internal consistency. FaCE's scale is accurate (reliable) with high discriminant ability between cognitive levels. Within the average testing time of five minutes, FaCE assesses the main cognitive domains affected in CRCI.FaCE is a rapid, reliable, and sensitive tool for detecting even minimal cognitive changes over time. This can contribute to early and appropriate interventions for better quality of life in patients with CRCI. In addition, FaCE could be used as a measurement tool in research exploring cognitive disorders in cancer survivors.","2023","2023 Jan 09","Amel Baghdadli; Giovanni G Arcuri; Clarence G Green; Lynn R Gauthier; Pierre Gagnon; Bruno Gagnon","CHU de Québec-Université Laval Research Centre, Québec City, QC, Canada.; Montreal University Hospital Center (CHUM) Research Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, School of Physical and Occupational Therapy, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Federation University Australia, Berwick, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.; CHU de Québec-Université Laval Research Centre, Québec City, QC, Canada.; Équipe de recherche Michel-Sarrazin en oncologie psychosociale et soins palliatifs, Québec City, QC, Canada.; Department of Family and Emergency Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec City, QC, Canada.; Université Laval Cancer Research Centre, Québec City, QC, Canada.; Réseau Québécois de recherche en soins palliatifs et de fin de vie du FRQS (RQSPAL), Québec City, QC, Canada.; VITAM-Centre de recherche en Santé Durable, Université Laval, Québec City, QC, Canada.; CHU de Québec-Université Laval Research Centre, Québec City, QC, Canada.; Équipe de recherche Michel-Sarrazin en oncologie psychosociale et soins palliatifs, Québec City, QC, Canada.; Université Laval Cancer Research Centre, Québec City, QC, Canada.; Réseau Québécois de recherche en soins palliatifs et de fin de vie du FRQS (RQSPAL), Québec City, QC, Canada.; VITAM-Centre de recherche en Santé Durable, Université Laval, Québec City, QC, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry and Neurosciences, Université Laval, Québec City, QC, Canada.; CHU de Québec-Université Laval Research Centre, Québec City, QC, Canada.

Methods: Main outcomes and measures included pulmonary function tests, imaging tests, and a battery of symptom, physical, emotional, and cognitive assessments 5 months post-acute COVID-19. Findings: Dyspnea, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, brain fog, and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms but there were generally no significant differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized cohorts (p > 0.05). Many patients had abnormal physical, emotional, and cognitive scores, but most functioned independently; there were no significant differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized cohorts (p > 0.05).

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of a pilot transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment on neuropsychiatric symptoms caused by long-COVID. In this study, we examined the efficacy of the TMS treatment protocol, which has been established to be effective in refractory depression, by applying it to patients who sought TMS treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms caused by long-COVID at TMS clinics in Tokyo, Japan in the context of the real world TMS registry study in Japan. Of the 23 patients (13 females) with long-COVID included in this case series, the main neuropsychiatric symptoms were chronic fatigue (n = 12) and cognitive dysfunction (n = 11), but most patients also showed mild depressive symptoms. The mean score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale before TMS treatment was 21.2, which improved to 9.8 after treatment. Similarly, the score on the Performance Status, which assesses the degree of fatigue, improved from 5.4 to 4.2, and the score on the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire-Depression 5-item, which reflects cognitive function, improved from 10.0 to 6.3. Although a few patients complained of pain at the stimulation site during the TMS as a side effect, there were no serious adverse events. Despite the limitations of this open-label pilot study, the TMS protocol implemented in this study may have beneficial effects on neuropsychiatric symptoms caused by long-COVID, including depressive symptoms, chronic fatigue, and cognitive impairment.

For these patients, purely neurological explanations are struggling to explain the development and maintenance of the great variety of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms occurring after COVID-19. We provide a psychological perspective based on the network theory of mental disorders as an added explanation that does not displace neurological mechanism but rather complements them. We suggest viewing the SARS-CoV-2 infection as a trigger that first activates nodes in a causally connected network of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms. In the following, activation will spread throughout the network that will get in a self-sustaining stable and dysfunctional state manifesting in ongoing symptoms known as post-COVID-19 syndrome. The network perspective allows to generalize explanations for persistent neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms to patients that experienced mild or moderate acute courses of COVID-19, but also to similar phenomena following other viral infections. In addition, it could explain why some symptoms did not occur during acute COVID-19, but develop weeks or months after it. This network perspective shifts the focus from viewing persistent symptoms as a continuation of COVID-19 to acknowledging it as a complex syndrome that indeed originates from the disease but fully unfolds after it (post-COVID). To test the presented network perspective, we will need extensive cross-sectional as well as longitudinal data on cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in post-COVID patients.","2022","2022 Nov","Daniel Scharfenberg; Ann-Katrin Schild; Clemens Warnke; Franziska Maier","Medical Psychology | Neuropsychology & Gender Studies, Center for Neuropsychological Diagnostic and Intervention (CeNDI), Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.; Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."

But what is brain fog? What sort of experiences do people talk about when they talk about brain fog? And, in turn, what might this tell us about potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms? This study examined first-person descriptions in order to better understand the phenomenology of brain fog. Posts containing 'brain fog' were scraped from the social media platform Reddit, using python, over a week in October 2021. We examined descriptions of brain fog, themes of containing subreddits (topic-specific discussion forums), and causal attributions. 1663 posts containing 'brain fog' were identified, 717 meeting inclusion criteria. 141 first person phenomenological descriptions depicted forgetfulness (51), difficulty concentrating (43), dissociative phenomena (34), cognitive 'slowness' and excessive effort (26), communication difficulties (22), 'fuzziness' or pressure (10) and fatigue (9). 50% (363/717) posts were in subreddits concerned with illness and disease: including COVID-19 (87), psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, autoimmune and functional disorders. 134 posts were in subreddits about drug use or discontinuation, and 44 in subreddits about abstention from masturbation. 570 posts included the poster's causal attribution, the most frequent attribution being long COVID in 60/570 (10%). 'Brain fog' is used on Reddit to describe heterogeneous experiences, including of dissociation, fatigue, forgetfulness and excessive cognitive effort, and in association with a range of illnesses, drugs and behaviours. Encouraging detailed description of these experiences will help us better understand pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive symptoms in health and disease.","2023","2023 Apr","Laura McWhirter; Heather Smyth; Ingrid Hoeritzauer; Anna Couturier; Jon Stone; Alan J Carson","Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK laura.mcwhirter@ed.ac.uk.; Edinburgh Medical School, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."

The family consists of a mother, father, son, and daughter. The mother experienced issues with focus, memory, anger, and amotivational syndrome. The father experienced weight issues and depression. The son experienced heavy drinking, along with some drug abuse and anxiety. The daughter experienced depression, lethargy, brain fog, focus issues, and anxiety, among others. A major clinical outcome of the results presented to the family members helped reduce personal guilt and augment potential hope for future healing. Our laboratory's prior research established that carriers of four or more alleles measured by GARS (DRD1-DRD4, DAT1, MOR, GABABR3, COMT, MAOAA, and 5HTLPR) are predictive of the addiction severity index (ASI) for drug abuse, and carriers of seven or more alleles are predictive of severe alcoholism. This generational case series shows the impact that genetic information has on reducing stigma and guilt in a nuclear family struggling with RDS behaviors.

It is estimated that, until the year 2050, this population worldwide will reach 22% of the total world population. Along with aging, the human immunologic system changes, a process called immunosenescence or even inflammaging. The aging immune system increases mortality and morbidity in the elderly mainly because it loses its capacity to react against internal and external aggressions. There is a decrease in B and T lymphocytes and CD4+ lymphocytes lose the CD28 protein expression that is needed for costimulation, leading to reduced response to viral infections. This could be responsible for more deleterious consequences of coronavirus disease infection in the elderly. Besides that, the human brain ages, being more susceptible to damage and viral infections, such as COVID-19 infection. There are several pathways that could explain the susceptibility to the COVID-19 infection in the elderly brain, one of them is binding to ACE 2 receptors in cerebral cells through the spike protein. It has been reported that glial cells and neurons, in addition to endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells in the brain, express the ACE 2 receptor, which would justify the neurological symptoms and consequences of the disease. This infection can have several clinical manifestations such as hemorrhagic stroke, delirium and long-term cognitive complaints, such as brain fog, polyneuropathies, short time memory complaints and insomnia. Although none of the studies could prove that there is a long-term neuronal damage, there are clinical sequelae that should be taken into account and more studies are necessary to know the consequences of the infection in the elderly brain.","2023","2023","Gabriela Serafim Keller; Eduarda Behenck Medeiros; Maria Laura Cecconi Dos Santos; Adrielly Vargas Lidio; Ewa Kucharska; Josiane Budni","Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, University of Southern Santa Catarina - UNESC, Criciúma, SC, 88806-000, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, University of Southern Santa Catarina - UNESC, Criciúma, SC, 88806-000, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, University of Southern Santa Catarina - UNESC, Criciúma, SC, 88806-000, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, University of Southern Santa Catarina - UNESC, Criciúma, SC, 88806-000, Brazil.; Department of Health Education, Gerontology and Geriatrics, Jesuit University Ignatianum in Krakow, Krakow, 31-501, Poland.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, University of Southern Santa Catarina - UNESC, Criciúma, SC, 88806-000, Brazil."

Aims of these analyses were to examine the effects of bother related to 5 symptom groups on participant's assessment of 4 outcomes: interference with everyday activities, interference with relationships, ""not feeling like myself,"" and self-ratings of health. Participants (N = 1,539 meeting eligibility and inclusion criteria) aged 35 to 60 years responded to the online Women Living Better Survey during March to August of 2020. In addition to rating 61 symptoms as bothersome on a scale from not at all bothered (0) to extremely bothered (6), they also indicated the degree to which their symptoms interfered with their activities and relationships indicating not at all (0) to a great deal (4). They indicated the extent to which they did not ""feel like myself"" choosing none of the time (0) to all of the time (4) and rated their health from poor (1) to excellent (5). Symptoms were grouped using results of principal components analysis. Five symptom groups with the highest bother ratings were analyzed for this report, including the following: brain fog, volatile mood, fatigue/pain, vasomotor symptoms (VMS)/sleep onset, and anxiety/vigilance symptoms. Two-stage hierarchical regression analysis was used to examine personal characteristics of the participants such as education, menopause-related factors, roles and stressors (stage 1), and effects of 5 symptom group bother ratings on interference with daily activities and relationships, ""not feeling like myself,"" and health ratings (stage 2). Interference with daily activities was related to difficulty paying for basic items and bother associated with the brain fog, anxiety/vigilance, fatigue/pain, and VMS/sleep onset symptom groups. Interference with relationships was correlated with being in a committed relationship and bother related to all 5 symptom groups. ""Not feeling like myself"" was related to having completed less education, reporting greater overall stress, brain fog, anxiety/vigilance, volatile mood, and fatigue/pain symptoms. More positive health ratings were related to having completed more education, having responsibility for children or dependents, experiencing greater satisfaction with roles, and less fatigue/pain symptom bother. Bother related to all 5 symptom groups was associated with increased interference with relationships, but bother related to interference with daily activities was related to only 4 of the 5 symptom groups, but not volatile mood symptoms. The phrase ""not feeling like myself"" was related to more bothersome anxiety/vigilance, volatile mood, brain fog, and fatigue/pain symptoms. Of interest was that VMS/sleep symptoms, often attributed to the menopausal transition, were not related to either ""not feeling like myself"" or to self-ratings of health. Moreover, self-rated health was related only to fatigue/pain symptom bother. These findings suggest that the experience of symptoms typically attributed to a developmental event, in this case perimenopause, may be viewed as unrelated to one's health. Further clarification of which symptoms can be attributed to perimenopause rather than other factors, such as aging, will improve anticipatory guidance about perimenopause. Similarly, additional investigation of the meaning of the phrase ""not feeling like myself"" could help clarify why bothersome symptoms, such as mood, fatigue, and cognitive symptoms, but not vasomotor/insomnia symptoms, are associated with this descriptor. Setting accurate expectations about what is typical can influence anticipations, understanding the spectrum of experiences, and attributions of symptoms. Further investigation on these fronts will contribute to timely, accurate anticipatory guidance and strategic symptom management for patients and providers.","2023","2023 Jan 01","Nancy Fugate Woods; Nina Coslov; Marcie K Richardson","From the Department of Biobehavioral Nursing and Health Informatics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.; Women Living Better, Cambridge, MA.; Atrius Health, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA."

This study was a single-center retrospective observational study for patients who visited the COVID-19 aftercare outpatient clinic (CAC) established in Okayama University Hospital in Japan during the period from 15 February 2021 to 29 July 2022. The long COVID patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of sleep disturbance, and the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients were analyzed. Out of 363 patients with long COVID, after excluding 6 patients, 60 patients (16.5%) (55% males, median age of 38 years) complaining of sleep disturbance were compared with 303 patients (83.5%) (43% males, median age of 40 years) without sleep-related symptoms. Although there were no significant differences in clinical backgrounds and severities of COVID-19 between the two groups by the multivariate analysis, the percentage of long COVID patients with sleep disturbance was significantly increased among patients infected in the Omicron-dominant phase. In addition, the prevalence rate of sleep disturbance in patients when infected in the Omicron phase (24.8%) was two-times higher than that in patients infected in the Delta phase (12.8%). Of note, the percentages of patients with sleep disturbance who also complained of general fatigue, headache, concentration loss, anxiety, low-grade fever, and brain fog symptoms were higher than the percentages of patients without sleep disturbance who had the same complaints. Among the types of sleep disturbance, the percentage of patients who complained of loss of sleep induction (75%) was much higher than the percentage of patients with early-awakening sleep disturbance (6.7%), and many of the patients with mid-awakening types of insomnia had brain fog symptoms. Endocrine examinations revealed that long COVID patients with sleep disturbance had significantly higher levels of plasma adrenocorticotropin and lower levels of serum growth hormone, suggesting the presence of hypothalamic-pituitary stress. The prevalence of sleep disturbance has been increasing in long COVID patients infected in the Omicron phase with a certain clinical and endocrine trend.","2022","2022 Dec 09","Naruhiko Sunada; Yasuhiro Nakano; Yuki Otsuka; Kazuki Tokumasu; Hiroyuki Honda; Yasue Sakurada; Yui Matsuda; Toru Hasegawa; Daisuke Omura; Kanako Ochi; Hideharu Hagiya; Keigo Ueda; Hitomi Kataoka; Fumio Otsuka","Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Center for Education in Medicine and Health Sciences, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan."

Sensitivity analyses were performed considering only symptoms beyond 3 months and only severe symptoms. 13,305 participants reported a SARS-CoV-2 positive test more than 30 days prior, 1480 (11.1% of eligible) responded to a survey about Long COVID symptoms, and 476 (32.2% of respondents) reported Long COVID symptoms (median 360 days after infection).Respondents' mean age was 53 and 1017 (69%) were female. Common Long COVID symptoms included fatigue, reported by 230/476 (48.3%), shortness of breath (109, 22.9%), confusion/brain fog (108, 22.7%), headache (103, 21.6%), and altered taste or smell (98, 20.6%). In multivariable models, number of acute COVID-19 symptoms (OR 1.30 per symptom, 95%CI 1.20-1.40), lower socioeconomic status/financial insecurity (OR 1.62, 95%CI 1.02-2.63), pre-infection depression (OR 1.08, 95%CI 1.01-1.16), and earlier variants (OR 0.37 for Omicron compared to ancestral strain, 95%CI 0.15-0.90) were associated with Long COVID symptoms. Variant wave, severity of acute infection, lower socioeconomic status and pre-existing depression are associated with Long COVID symptoms. Question: What are the patterns of symptoms and risk factors for Long COVID among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals?Findings: Persistent symptoms were highly prevalent, especially fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, brain fog/confusion, and altered taste/smell, which persisted beyond 1 year among 56% of participants with symptoms; a minority of participants reported severe Long COVID symptoms. Number of acute symptoms during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, financial insecurity, pre-existing depression, and infection with earlier variants are associated with prevalent Long COVID symptoms independent of vaccination, medical history, and other factors.Meaning: Severity of acute infection, SARS-CoV-2 variant, and financial insecurity and depression are associated with Long COVID symptoms.","2022","2022 Dec 06","Matthew S Durstenfeld; Michael J Peluso; Noah D Peyser; Feng Lin; Sara J Knight; Audrey Djibo; Rasha Khatib; Heather Kitzman; Emily O'Brien; Natasha Williams; Carmen Isasi; John Kornak; Thomas W Carton; Jeffrey E Olgin; Mark J Pletcher; Gregory M Marcus; Alexis L Beatty","Division of Cardiology at ZSFG and Department of Medicine, UCSF.; Division of HIV, Infectious Disease, & Global Medicine, UCSF.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, UCSF.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCSF.; Division of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah.; CVS Health Clinical Trial Services.; Advocate Aurora Research Institute.; Baylor Scott and White Health and Wellness Center.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine.; Institute for Excellence in Health Equity, Center for Healthful Behavior Change, NYU Grossman School of Medicine.; Department of Epidemiology & Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCSF.; Louisiana Public Health Institute.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, UCSF.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCSF.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, UCSF.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, UCSF.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCSF."

Therefore, we hypothesized that these effects would be beneficial for treating myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The present study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of wasabi extract containing 6-MSITC on ME/CFS in an open-label trial. Fifteen patients (3 males, 12 females, 20-58 years old) were orally administered wasabi extract (9.6 mg of 6-MSITC/day) for 12 weeks. The following parameters and test results were compared pre- and post-treatment: performance status (PS), self-rating questionnaires, pressure pain threshold (PPT) on the occiput, Trail Making test-A (TMT-A), and hemodynamic patterns determined by an active standing test. After treatment with 6-MSITC, PS improved significantly (p = 0.001). Although the scores on the 11-item Chalder Fatigue scale (CFS-11) and numerical rating scale (NRS) of fatigue did not show significant changes, subjective symptoms improved significantly, including headache frequency (4.1 to 3.0 times/week, p = 0.001) and myalgia (4.1 to 2.4 times/week, p = 0.019), NRS brain fog scores (5.7 to 4.5, p = 0.011), difficulty finding appropriate words (4.8 to 3.7, p = 0.015), photophobia (4.8 to 3.5, p = 0.008), and the Profile of Mood Status vigor score (46.9 to 50.0, p = 0.045). The PPT of the right occiput (17.3 to 21.3 kPa, p = 0.01) and TMT-A scores (53.0 to 38.1 s, p = 0.007) also changed, suggesting reduced pain sensitivity, and improved cognitive function, respectively. Orthostatic patterns determined by a standing test did not show remarkable changes. There were no serious adverse reactions. This study suggests that 6-MSITC improves PS as well as subjective symptoms such as pain and cognitive dysfunction, and psychological vitality of patients with ME/CFS. It also improved cognitive performance and increased pain thresholds in these patients. 6-MSITC may be a promising therapeutic option especially for improving cognitive dysfunction associated with ME/CFS.","2022","2022 Dec 12","Takakazu Oka; Yu Yamada; Battuvshin Lkhagvasuren; Mutsuhiro Nakao; Ryota Nakajima; Masanobu Kanou; Ryuji Hiramatsu; Yo-Ichi Nabeshima","Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, International University of Health and Welfare Hospital, Iguchi 537-3, Nasushiobara-Shi, Tochigi-Ken, 329-2763, Japan. okatakakazu@gmail.com.; Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, International University of Health and Welfare Narita Hospital, 852 Hatakeda, Narita, Chiba, 286-8520, Japan. okatakakazu@gmail.com.; Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, International University of Health and Welfare Hospital, Iguchi 537-3, Nasushiobara-Shi, Tochigi-Ken, 329-2763, Japan.; Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, International University of Health and Welfare Narita Hospital, 852 Hatakeda, Narita, Chiba, 286-8520, Japan.; Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, International University of Health and Welfare Narita Hospital, 852 Hatakeda, Narita, Chiba, 286-8520, Japan.; TEIJIN LIMITED, 2-1, Kasumigaseki 3-Chome, Chiyoda-Ku, Tokyo, 100-8585, Japan.; TEIJIN LIMITED, 2-1, Kasumigaseki 3-Chome, Chiyoda-Ku, Tokyo, 100-8585, Japan.; PAL LIMITED, 10-31-105, Furuedai 3-Chome, Suita-Shi, Osaka, 565-0874, Japan.; PAL LIMITED, 10-31-105, Furuedai 3-Chome, Suita-Shi, Osaka, 565-0874, Japan."

This is the first study on twins without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection to estimate the influence of genetic components and shared as well as individual environments on pandemic-associated fatigue. The study sample included 55 monozygotic and 45 dizygotic twin pairs. A total of 34.5% reported an increase in fatigue since the pandemic. A significant correlation was shown between the responses within monozygotic (χ2[1] = 11.14, p = 0.001) and dizygotic pairs (χ2[1] = 18.72, p < 0.001). In all pandemic-associated fatigue dimensions, individual environment (ranging from e2 = 0.64 to e2 = 0.84) and heritability (ranging from h2 = 0.32 to h2 = 1.04) seem to have the highest impact. The number of comorbidities significantly correlated with physical fatigue (Spearman’s ρ = 0.232, p < 0.001) and psychological impairment due to pandemic measures with the total fatigue score (Spearman’s ρ = 0.243, p < 0.001). However, calculated ANCOVAs with these significant correlations as covariates showed no significant influence on the mean values of the respective fatigue dimensions. Susceptibility to pandemic-associated fatigue may be genetically and environmentally determined, while intensity is also influenced by individual components. The prevalence of fatigue is high even in individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future mental health prevention and intervention programs should be implemented to alleviate the impact of the pandemic on the global population.","2022","2022 Nov 29","Sophia Kristina Rupp; Katja Weimer; Miriam Goebel-Stengel; Paul Enck; Stephan Zipfel; Andreas Stengel","Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Tübingen, 72076 Tübingen, Germany.; Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Ulm University Medical Center, 89081 Ulm, Germany.; Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Tübingen, 72076 Tübingen, Germany.; Department of Internal Medicine, Helios Kliniken GmbH, 78628 Rottweil, Germany.; Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Tübingen, 72076 Tübingen, Germany.; Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Tübingen, 72076 Tübingen, Germany.; Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Tübingen, 72076 Tübingen, Germany.; Charité Center for Internal Medicine and Dermatology, Department for Psychosomatic Medicine, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health, 10117 Berlin, Germany."

We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 15 patients of a Midwestern academic hospital's post-COVID-19 clinic. We audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed interviews thematically using a combined deductive-inductive approach and collected participants' characteristics from chart review. Participants frequently used descriptive and metaphorical language to describe symptoms that were relapsing-remitting and unpredictable. Fatigue and brain fog affected all domains and identified subthemes included symptoms' synergistic effects, difficulty with multitasking, lack of support, poor self-perception, and fear of loss of income and employment. Personal relationships were affected with change of responsibilities, difficulty parenting, social isolation, and guilt due to the burdens placed on family. Furthermore, underlying social stigma contributed to negative emotions, which significantly affected emotional and mental health. Our findings highlight PASC's negative impact on patients' daily lives.

The ligands were neuropeptides, such as substance P (1-7) and enkephalin, bound at a large site of the C-terminal or associated with the N-terminal β-sheet. The BA4 and BA5 Omicron variants of N also exhibited a large site as in wt N, and an increased flexibility of the BA5 variant, enabling substance P binding. The binding sites of some ligands deduced from modeling in wt N were assessed by mutation studies in surface plasmon resonance experiments. Dynamic light scattering showed that the ligands impeded RNA binding to N, which likely inhibited replication. We suggest that the physiological role of these neuropeptides in neurotransmission, pain and vasodilation for cholecystokinin and substance P could be altered by binding to N. We speculate that N may link between viral replication and multiple pathways leading to long COVID-19 symptoms. Therefore, N may constitute a ""danger hub"" that needs to be inhibited, even at high cost for the host. Antivirals targeted to N may therefore reduce the risk of brain fog and stroke, and improve patients' health.","2022","2022 Nov 21","Julien Henri; Laetitia Minder; Kevin Mohanasundaram; Sébastien Dilly; Anne Goupil-Lamy; Carmelo Di Primo; Anny Slama Schwok","Laboratoire de Biologie Computationnelle et Quantitative, Institut de Biologie Paris-Seine, UMR-CNRS 7238, Sorbonne Université, F-75005 Paris, France.; Institut Européen de Chimie et Biologie (IECB), CNRS, INSERM UAR 3033, US001, Univ.

Primary analyses examined associations between long COVID and lack of full employment or unemployment, adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, urbanicity, and region, using multiple logistic regression with interlocking survey weights. The cohort included 15,307 survey respondents ages 18-69 with test-confirmed COVID-19 at least 2 months prior, of whom 2,236 (14.6%) reported long COVID symptoms, including 1,027/2,236 (45.9%) reporting either 'brain fog' or impaired memory.

A rarely reported adverse reaction to SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations is small fiber neuropathy (SFN). Here, we present three patients with SFN after the second dose of messenger ribonucleic acid-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Data for this study were collected via the self-made platform ""Pubbly"" for reporting side effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. Three patients with post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination SFN were identified: a 40 yo Caucasian female (patient 1), a 52 yo Caucasian female (patient 2), and a 32 yo Caucasian female (patient 3). Patient 1 complained about fatigue, dizziness, flushing, palpitations, diarrhea, muscle weakness, and gait disturbance 10 days after the second Pfizer jab. Patient 2 reported dizziness, balance problems, brain fog, palpitations, dysphagia, and sleep problems. Patient 3 complained about profound fatigue, brain fog, vertigo, pre-syncopal sensations, hair loss, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, paresthesias, irregular menstrual cycles, muscle weakness, and hives 1 day after the second Moderna dose. All three patients underwent skin biopsy upon which SFN was diagnosed. Patient 1 profited from immunoglobulins, but patient 2 did not require any treatment. Symptoms in patient 3 resolved upon symptomatic treatment. Despite treatment, patient 1 did not completely recover. SFN can be a rare side effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. Post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination SFN can be mild or severe and may or may not require treatment. Post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination SFN is most likely immune-mediated as it responds to intravenous immunoglobulins.","2022","2022 Jul","Josef Finsterer","Department of Neurology, Neurology and Neurophysiology Center, Vienna, Austria."
"416","36379497","Long COVID: Rapid Evidence Review.","American family physician","United States; Humans; COVID-19; Headache; Chest Pain; Fatigue; Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome","","Postacute sequelae of COVID-19, also known as long COVID, affects approximately 10% to 30% of the hundreds of millions of people who have had acute COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines long COVID as the presence of new, returning, or ongoing symptoms associated with acute COVID-19 that persist beyond 28 days. The diagnosis of long COVID can be based on a previous clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and does not require a prior positive polymerase chain reaction or antigen test result to confirm infection. Patients with long COVID report a broad range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, anosmia, chest pain, cognitive impairment (brain fog), dizziness, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, insomnia, mood changes, palpitations, paresthesias, and postexertional malaise. The presentation is variable, and symptoms can fluctuate or persist and relapse and remit. The diagnostic approach is to differentiate long COVID from acute sequelae of COVID-19, previous comorbidities, unmasking of preexisting health conditions, reinfections, new acute concerns, and complications of prolonged illness, hospitalization, or isolation. Many presenting symptoms of long COVID are commonly seen in a primary care practice, and management can be improved by using established treatment paradigms and supportive care. Although several medications have been suggested for the treatment of fatigue related to long COVID, the evidence for their use is currently lacking. Holistic treatment strategies for long COVID include discussion of pacing and energy conservation; individualized, symptom-guided, phased return to activity programs; maintaining adequate hydration and a healthy diet; and treatment of underlying medical conditions.","2022","2022 Nov","Eric Herman; Elizabeth Shih; Anthony Cheng","Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.; Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.; Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon."

We retrospectively analysed data from electronic medical records of patients admitted to the post-COVID-19 outpatient service of the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit, Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy, between June 2020 and June 2021, 4-12 weeks after hospital discharge. A total of 428 patients, 41% women, median age 64 years, underwent a follow-up visit a median 53 days after hospital discharge. Overall, 76% patients reported at least one persistent symptom, including dyspnoea (37%), chronic fatigue (36%), insomnia (16%), visual disorders (13%) and brain fog (13%). Increasing oxygen support (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8), use of immunosuppressants (OR 6.4, 95% CI 1.5-28) and female sex (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9) were associated with a higher risk of long COVID symptoms. Comparison between symptomatic patients infected in the period March-December 2020 (prevalent circulation of wild-type SARS-CoV-2) with those infected in the period January-April 2021 (prevalent circulation of B.1.1.7 Alpha variant) showed a significant modification in the pattern of symptoms belonging to the neurological and cognitive/emotional categories. Our findings confirmed shortness of breath and chronic fatigue as the most frequent long COVID manifestations, while female sex and severe COVID-19 course were the main risk factors for developing lingering symptoms.

We conducted a two-wave study, with waves 1 and 2 occurring in 2011 and 2014, respectively. Data of 462 respondents aged 9-14 years during wave 1 and who participated in both surveys were used in the present analysis. A factor analysis was performed using the mental and behavioral changes reported by respondents in wave 1. Psychological distress was defined as a score of ≥5 on the six-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, as measured in wave 2. With the factors generated in this analysis set as independent variables, the odds ratios (OR) (95% confidence intervals, 95% CIs) for psychological distress were calculated using logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, house damage, living environment, and loss of family or friends. Psychological distress was present in 108 (23.4%) of the respondents. The factor analysis yielded three factors describing mental and behavioral changes: interpersonal issues, brain fog, and anxiety and panic. Of these, interpersonal issues were significantly associated with subsequent psychological distress, with an OR of 2.59 (95% CI 1.58-4.25). This association did not change even when stratified by age and sex. This study suggests that interpersonal issues are a significant predictor of psychological distress in children and adolescents living in areas affected by a large-scale disaster.","2022","2022 Jan","Daisuke Fujimaki; Kozo Tanno; Junji Kuno; Haruki Shimoda; Eri Takusari; Kiyomi Sakata; Seiichiro Kobayashi; Akira Ogawa","Department of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, Yahaba-cho, Iwate, Japan.; Department of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, Yahaba-cho, Iwate, Japan.; Department of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, Yahaba-cho, Iwate, Japan.; Department of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, Yahaba-cho, Iwate, Japan.; Department of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, Yahaba-cho, Iwate, Japan.; Department of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, Yahaba-cho, Iwate, Japan.; Iwate Medical University, Yahaba-cho, Iwate, Japan.; Iwate Medical University, Yahaba-cho, Iwate, Japan."

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) version 10 has been widely used in assessing psychological distress among general and clinical populations from different cultural backgrounds. To our knowledge, however, researchers have not yet validated these findings among patients with persistent COVID-19. A cross-sectional validation study was conducted with 100 patients from the EXER-COVID project (69.8% women; mean (±standard deviation) ages: 47.4 ± 9.5 years). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were performed on the 10-item CES-D to test four model fits: (a) unidimensional model, (b) two-factor correlated model, (c) three-factor correlated model, and (d) second-order factor model. The diagonal-weighted least-squares estimator was used, as it is commonly applied to latent variable models with ordered categorical variables. The reliability indices of the 10-item CES-D in patients with persistent COVID-19 were as follows: depressive affect factor ( αOrd=0.82${\alpha }_{\mathrm{Ord}}=0.82$ ; ωu-cat=0.78${\omega }_{{\rm{u}}-\mathrm{cat}}=0.78$ ), somatic retardation factor ( αOrd=0.78${\alpha }_{\mathrm{Ord}}=0.78$ ; ωu-cat=0.56${\omega }_{{\rm{u}}-\mathrm{cat}}=0.56$ ), and positive affect factor ( αOrd=0.56${\alpha }_{\mathrm{Ord}}=0.56$ ; ωu-cat=0.55${\omega }_{{\rm{u}}-\mathrm{cat}}=0.55$ ). The second-order model fit showed good Omega reliability ( ωho=0.87${\omega }_{\mathrm{ho}}=0.87$ ). Regarding CFAs, the unidimensional-factor model shows poor goodness of fit, especially residuals analysis (root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.081 [95% confidence interval, CI = 0.040-0.119]; standardized root mean square residual [SRMR] = 0.101). The two-factor correlated model, three-factor correlated model, and second-order factor model showed adequate goodness of fit, and the χ2 difference test ( ∆X2$\unicode{x02206}{X}^{2}$ ) did not show significant differences between the goodness of fit for these models ( ∆X2=4.1128$\unicode{x02206}{X}^{2}=4.1128$ ; p = 0.127). Several indices showed a good fit with the three-factor correlated model: goodness-of-fit index = 0.974, comparative fit index = 0.990, relative noncentrality index = 0.990, and incremental fit index = 0.990, which were all above 0.95, the traditional cut-off establishing adequate fit. On the other hand, RMSEA = 0.049 (95% CI = 0.000-0.095), where an RMSEA < 0.06-0.08 indicates an adequate fit. Item loadings on the factors were statistically significant ( λj≥0.449${\lambda }_{j}\ge 0.449$ ; p's < 0.001), indicating that the items loaded correctly on the corresponding factors and the relationship between factors ( ϕ≥0.382$\phi \ge 0.382$ ; p's ≤ 0.001. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide validity and reliability to 10-item CES-D in a persistent COVID-19 Spanish patient sample.

This phenomenon remains unexplained and is currently untreatable. Bile duct ligation (BDL) is an established rodent model of cholestasis. In addition to liver changes, BDL animals develop cognitive symptoms early in the disease process (before development of cirrhosis and/or liver failure). The cellular mechanisms underpinning these cognitive symptoms are poorly understood. Herein, the study explored the neurocognitive symptom manifestations, and tested potential therapies, in BDL mice, and used human neuronal cell cultures to explore translatability to humans. BDL animals exhibited short-term memory loss and showed reduced astrocyte coverage of the blood-brain barrier, destabilized hippocampal network activity, and neuronal senescence. Ursodeoxycholic acid (first-line therapy for most human cholestatic diseases) did not reverse symptomatic or mechanistic aspects. In contrast, obeticholic acid (OCA), a farnesoid X receptor agonist and second-line anti-cholestatic agent, normalized memory function, suppressed blood-brain barrier changes, prevented hippocampal network deficits, and reversed neuronal senescence. Co-culture of human neuronal cells with either BDL or human cholestatic patient serum induced cellular senescence and increased mitochondrial respiration, changes that were limited again by OCA. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of cognitive symptoms in BDL animals, suggesting that OCA therapy or farnesoid X receptor agonism could be used to limit cholestasis-induced neuronal senescence.","2023","2023 Jan","Lucy M V Gee;

PBF and FBF showed higher levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms than HS, and FBF showed the worst psychological outcome. Moreover, worse cognitive symptoms were related to the female gender, greater neuropsychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, and rumination/indecision. Being a woman and more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms were predictors of FBF severity.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between the brain fog symptoms and the QoL at work in non-hospitalized patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Three hundred non-hospitalized patients (79.33% women; median age, 36 years; interquartile range, 30-48 years) were included in the final analysis. An anonymous neuropsychological questionnaire containing eight different questions on the presence of brain fog symptoms in four time intervals, i.e., pre-COVID-19 and 0-4, 4-12, and >12 weeks after infection, was retrospectively introduced to patients and staff of the University Hospital in Krakow. Additionally, a four-point Likert scale was used to evaluate QoL at work in four time periods. Included were participants aged ≥ 18 years in whom the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by the RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swab and the first symptoms occurred no earlier than 3 months before the completion of the questionnaire. Results: Before SARS-CoV-2 infection, 28.00% (n = 84) of patients reported poor QoL at work. Within 4, 4-12, and >12 weeks after infection, a decrease in QoL was observed in 75.67% (n = 227), 65.00% (n = 195), and 53.66% (n = 161) of patients, respectively (p < 0.001). With increasing deterioration of the QoL at work, the number of brain fog symptoms increased, and patients with severe QoL impairment exhibited a median of five symptoms for <4, 4-12, and >12 weeks post-COVID-19. In the multivariable logistic regression model, predictors of the deterioration of the QoL at work depended on the time from COVID-19 onset; in the acute phase of the disease (<4 weeks), it was predicted by impairment in remembering information from the past (OR 1.88, 95%CI: 1.18-3.00, p = 0.008) and multitasking (OR 1.96, 95%CI: 1.48-2.58, p < 0.001). Furthermore, an impairment in the QoL at work 4-12 weeks and >12 weeks after COVID-19 was independently associated with age (OR 0.46, 95%CI: 0.25-0.85, p = 0.014 and OR 1.03, 95%CI: 1.01-1.05, p = 0.025, respectively), problems with multitasking (OR 2.05, 95%CI: 1.40-3.01, p < 0.001 and OR 1.75, 95%CI: 1.15-2.66, p = 0.009, respectively), answering questions in an understandable/unambiguous manner (OR 1.99, 95%CI: 1.27-3.14, p = 0.003 and OR 2.00, 95%CI: 1.47-2.36, p = 0.001, respectively), and, only for the >12 week interval, problems with remembering information from the past (OR 2.21, 95%CI: 1.24-3.92, p = 0.007). Conclusions: Certain brain fog symptoms, such as impaired memory or multitasking, are predictors of a poorer QoL at work not only during the acute phase of COVID-19 but also within more than 12 weeks after the onset of infection.","2022","2022 Oct 06","Zaneta Chatys-Bogacka; Iwona Mazurkiewicz; Joanna Slowik; Monika Bociaga-Jasik; Anna Dzieza-Grudnik; Agnieszka Slowik; Marcin Wnuk; Leszek Drabik","Department of Neurology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 30-688 Krakow, Poland.; Department of Neurology, University Hospital in Krakow, 30-688 Krakow, Poland.; Department of Neurology, University Hospital in Krakow, 30-688 Krakow, Poland.; Department of Periodontology, Preventive Dentistry and Oral Medicine, Institute of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31-155 Krakow, Poland.; Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 30-688 Krakow, Poland.; Department of Internal Medicine and Gerontology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 30-688 Krakow, Poland.; Department of Neurology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 30-688 Krakow, Poland.; Department of Neurology, University Hospital in Krakow, 30-688 Krakow, Poland.; Department of Neurology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 30-688 Krakow, Poland.; Department of Neurology, University Hospital in Krakow, 30-688 Krakow, Poland.; Department of Pharmacology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31-531 Krakow, Poland.; John Paul II Hospital, 31-202 Krakow, Poland."

Here, we present a case of PASC in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis characterized by viral persistence in the nasopharynx for 6 months after acute infection. We demonstrate transient disappearance of antigen persistence and decreased antiviral and autoimmune T cell responses after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and tocilizumab treatment. A 37-year-old female with a 7-year history of rheumatoid arthritis enrolled in a COVID-19 research study was found to continuously test SARS-CoV-2 antigen positive in the nasopharynx for 6 months after acute infection. She simultaneously presented with new-onset PASC symptoms including chronic occipital headache and periods of intense fatigue 8 weeks after acute infection. The patient was prescribed nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to treat SARS-CoV-2 persistence at 3.5 months post-acute infection and observed a reduction in PASC symptoms 3 weeks after completing antiviral treatment. After resurgence of PASC symptoms, she stopped treatment with tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis to attempt complete SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance. The severity of the patient's PASC symptoms subsequently increased, and she developed new-onset brain fog in addition to previous symptoms, which resolved after resumption of tocilizumab treatment. Assessment of adaptive immune responses demonstrated that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and tocilizumab treatment decreased antiviral and autoreactive T cell activation. After resuming tocilizumab treatment, the patient's PASC symptoms were significantly reduced, but nasopharyngeal antigen positivity remained. These data suggest that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir should be considered in the treatment of PASC in patients who have SARS-CoV-2 antigen persistence, though care must be taken to monitor the patient for symptom resurgence or viral reactivation. In addition, the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab may ameliorate PASC symptoms in patients with persistent headache, fatigue, and brain fog.","2022","2022","Lavanya Visvabharathy; Zachary S Orban; Igor J Koralnik","Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States.; Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States.; Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States."

To test this hypothesis, we administered a Stroop colour-word task in which attentional demand was varied by task difficulty (congruent versus incongruent cues) and the presence of a secondary auditory stimulus (passive or active listening to an oddball-type paradigm). We measured subjective mental effort, objective performance (reaction times and accuracy), metacognition and EEG-based biomarkers of mental workload. We tested 19 functional cognitive disorder patients and 23 healthy controls. Patients reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, fatigue, pain, sleep disruption, dissociation and obsessiveness. They rated their memory as significantly poorer than healthy controls; however, accuracy did not differ between groups in any condition. In contrast to healthy controls, patients rated their performance as poorer on the congruent Stroop task with background noise compared to silent conditions. Functional cognitive disorder was consistently associated with slower reaction times but this was not exacerbated by increased attentional demand. Patients but not healthy controls reported greater mental workload in noisy conditions but EEG biomarkers were similar between groups, regardless of task difficulty. Functional cognitive disorder has significant syndromic overlap with mood disorders and chronic fatigue and pain. It is associated with global metacognitive failure whereas local (task-specific) metacognition is only selectively impaired. Patients were slower than healthy controls, which might contribute to the 'brain fog' reported in this condition. Although subjective mental effort was increased in noisy conditions, we found no evidence of attentional exhaustion in functional cognitive disorder. Our results indicate that functional cognitive disorder is a multisystem condition affecting reaction time, subjective mental effort and global metacognition.","2023","2023 Apr 19","Tiago Teodoro; Akihiro Koreki; Jiaying Chen; Jan Coebergh; Norman Poole; Joaquim J Ferreira; Mark J Edwards; Jeremy D Isaacs","Neurosciences Research Centre, Institute of Molecular and Clinical Sciences, St George's, University of London, London SW17 0RE, UK.; Instituto de Medicina Molecular João Lobo Antunes, Universidade de Lisboa, 1649-028 Lisboa, Portugal.; Department of Neurology, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London SW17 0QT, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, National Hospital Organization Shimofusa Psychiatric Medical Center, 266-0007 Chiba, Japan.; Neurosciences Research Centre, Institute of Molecular and Clinical Sciences, St George's, University of London, London SW17 0RE, UK.; Neurosciences Research Centre, Institute of Molecular and Clinical Sciences, St George's, University of London, London SW17 0RE, UK.; Department of Neurology, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London SW17 0QT, UK.; South West London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust, London SW17 7DJ, UK.; Instituto de Medicina Molecular João Lobo Antunes, Universidade de Lisboa, 1649-028 Lisboa, Portugal.; Neurosciences Research Centre, Institute of Molecular and Clinical Sciences, St George's, University of London, London SW17 0RE, UK.; Department of Neurology, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London SW17 0QT, UK.; Neurosciences Research Centre, Institute of Molecular and Clinical Sciences, St George's, University of London, London SW17 0RE, UK.; Department of Neurology, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London SW17 0QT, UK."

Participants (N = 2,406) aged 35 to 55 years completed the Women Living Better Survey online between March to August 2020, and 1,529 met the inclusion criteria and provided menstrual cycle data for staging reproductive aging. They were recruited from the Women Living Better newsletter and from other online groups of midlife women. Hierarchical regression analysis using a two-stage model tested the effect of several factors on each of five bothersome symptom groups: brain fog, volatile mood, fatigue/pain, vasomotor/sleep disruption, and anxiety/vigilance symptoms. In stage I, personal characteristics, reproductive aging stage, and health behaviors were examined, and in stage II roles (ie, caregiver, partner, employment-related), satisfaction with life roles and stressors associated with roles were added. More bothersome brain fog symptoms were associated with less education, MT (vs late reproductive stage), low satisfaction with life roles, and greater health-related and overcommitment stress (all P < 0.005). More bothersome volatile mood symptoms were associated with health-related, partner relationship, and other relationship stress. More bothersome fatigue/pain symptoms were associated with less education and greater difficulty paying for basics and health-related and other relationship stress. Vasomotor/sleep-onset symptoms were associated with less education, MT, and health-related and work stress. More bothersome anxiety/vigilance symptoms were associated with less education, more difficulty paying for basics, and health and work stress. Recognizing that midlife stress comes from many role- and relationship-related sources and that several of these stressors are associated with greater symptom bother supports the importance of proactive identification and management of sources of stress.","2022","2022 Dec 01","Nancy Fugate Woods; Nina Coslov; Marcie K Richardson","From the Department of Biobehavioral Nursing and Health Informatics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.; Women Living Better, Cambridge, MA.; Atrius Health, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA."

These symptoms are self-reported and vary from patient to patient, making it difficult to accurately diagnose and initiate a proper treatment course. Objective measures to identify and quantify neural deficits underlying the symptom profiles are lacking. This study tested the hypothesis that oculomotor, vestibular, reaction time, and cognitive (OVRT-C) testing using eye-tracking can objectively identify and measure functional neural deficits post COVID-19 infection. Subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 77) were tested post-infection with a battery of 20 OVRT-C tests delivered on a portable eye-tracking device (Neurolign Dx100). Data from 14 tests were compared to previously collected normative data from subjects with similar demographics. Post-COVID subjects were also administered the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) for symptom evaluation. A significant percentage of post COVID-19 patients (up to 86%) scored outside the norms in 12 out of 14 tests, with smooth pursuit and optokinetic responses being most severely affected. A multivariate model constructed using stepwise logistic regression identified 6 metrics as significant indicators of post-COVID patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.89, the estimated specificity was 98% (with cutoff value of 0.5) and the sensitivity was 88%. There were moderate but significant correlations between NSI domain key variables and OVRT-C tests. This study demonstrates the feasibility of OVRT-C testing to provide objective measures of neural deficits in people recovering from COVID-19 infection. Such testing may serve as an efficient tool for identifying hidden neurological deficits post COVID-19, screening patients at risk of developing long COVID, and may help guide rehabilitation and treatment strategies.","2022","2022","Kevin M Kelly; R Anghinah; A Kullmann; R C Ashmore; A S Synowiec; L C Gibson; L Manfrinati; A de Araújo; R R Spera; S M D Brucki; R L Tuma; A Braverman; A Kiderman","Neurology Department, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.; Neurology Department at Clinical Hospital of Medical School of University of Sáo Paulo, Sáo Paulo, Brazil.; Medical Department of Athletes Union of Sáo Paulo, Sáo Paulo, Brazil.; Neurolign USA LLC, A Subsidiary of Neurolign Technologies Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, United States.; Neurolign USA LLC, A Subsidiary of Neurolign Technologies Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, United States.; Neurology Department, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.; Neurolign USA LLC, A Subsidiary of Neurolign Technologies Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, United States.; Neurology Department at Clinical Hospital of Medical School of University of Sáo Paulo, Sáo Paulo, Brazil.; Medical Department of Athletes Union of Sáo Paulo, Sáo Paulo, Brazil.; Neurology Department at Clinical Hospital of Medical School of University of Sáo Paulo, Sáo Paulo, Brazil.; Neurology Department at Clinical Hospital of Medical School of University of Sáo Paulo, Sáo Paulo, Brazil.; Neurology Department at Clinical Hospital of Medical School of University of Sáo Paulo, Sáo Paulo, Brazil.; Neurology Department at Clinical Hospital of Medical School of University of Sáo Paulo, Sáo Paulo, Brazil.; Neurolign USA LLC, A Subsidiary of Neurolign Technologies Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, United States.; Neurolign USA LLC, A Subsidiary of Neurolign Technologies Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, United States."

A range of neurological (e.g., brain fog, encephalitis, myalgia) and psychiatric (e.g., affective disorders, delirium, cognitive disturbances) complications of a novel nature have been observed in patients during the acute phase of illness, which often persist as a Long-COVID state for months after the primary recovery. The pandemic has progressed to a psychodemic and syndemic, affecting communities with social distress, panic, fears, increased home violence, and protest movements that derive from conspiracy theories and hostile attitudes towards vaccination and lockdown measures. In response to this complex scenario of major social changes, universities must face the need to equip the new generation of doctors with novel special skills. The study course (50 hours duration; 20 lectures, three webinars, three e-discussion forums, five local seminars, two social events, three intermediate assessments and a final test for certification; bilingual Russian/English hybrid format, information materials, video-content, interactive web-page and social media) was developed by the team of the International Centre for Education and Research in Neuropsychiatry (ICERN), and is unique for the EU. The course integrates the most relevant data on SARS-Cov-2-related neuropsychiatry, and COVID-19' pandemic impact on mental health and society, including assignment of the vulnerable groups of students and healthcare professionals. The major topics covered during the course are (i) Novel virus, (ii) Brain, (iii) Society. The project takes place originally in Samara State Medical University. The ICERN Faculty includes academic staff from France, Hungary, Italy, Russia, Switzerland, invited speakers from the WHO Regional Office for Europe and World Psychiatric Association (EU Zones) members, some of them employed at ICERN by remote work contracts. The format of the educational process for students is hybrid suggesting both remote and face-to-face events. Distant learning participants and EU lecturers are to attend on-line via zoom platform, whereas local participants and staff work face-to-face in the ICERN video-conference room. The course is addressed to a broad audience of doctors, undergraduate and postgraduate students, and researchers from EU wishing to upgrade their knowledge in the pandemic-associated neuropsychiatry. The evaluation process supposes three intermediate assessments and a final test for certification. On-line assessment is to be performed at the project web-page - 10 randomly selected questions with scoring from 1 to 10 each. The Pass Score is 70-100. At the end of the course all the participants receive certificates of Samara State Medical University according to the ERASMUS policy book, as planned in 2021. We formatted this course as essential for the target audience to improve their resources of professional adaptability in the field of neuropsychiatry and mental healthcare management during challenging times. The ICERN course in pandemic-related neuropsychiatry is essential for early career health professionals and targets the principles of ""academia without borders"" in the context of international medical knowledge exchange. In the conditions of the changing social situation this educational content is necessary for the young doctors to acquire the add-on skills on flexibility to switch toward new professional approaches in the times of need. The long-term outcomes in pandemic-related neuropsychiatry are still to be seen, though the first feedback on the course content is already promising for the academic community.","2022","2022 Sep","Tatiana Kozina; Xenia Gonda; Florence Thibaut; Giuseppe Tavormina; Natalia Borisova; Dmitriy Gorbatchev; Andrey Protasov; Aleksandr Kolsanov; Daria Smirnova","Samara State Medical University, Samara, Russia."

Both had memory impairment, mental exhaustion, and inattention with associated depressed mood. They were given bupropion extended release and though varied with dosing and time to resolution, they recovered dramatically. The dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor is known to have effects on the brain that may treat symptoms of brain fog including blocking hippocampal cell loss, increased neural activity in the cingulate cortex, and decreasing proinflammatory cytokines.

Data extracted from the medical records of the 55 patients (40 women), mean age 42.4 (12 to 79 years), and a qualitative study of 6 of them using a semi-open-ended questionnaire allowed to highlight the clinical picture described by WHO as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) also known as long COVID.

Depending upon the patient’s age at the onset of COVID-19 and other factors, up to ~35% of all elderly COVID-19 patients develop a mild-to-severe encephalopathy due to complications arising from a SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm and a surge in cytokine-mediated pro-inflammatory and immune signaling. In fact, this cytokine storm syndrome: (i) appears to predispose aged COVID-19 patients to the development of other neurological complications, especially those who have experienced a more serious grade of COVID-19 infection; (ii) lies along highly interactive and pathological pathways involving SARS-CoV-2 infection that promotes the parallel development and/or intensification of progressive and often lethal neurological conditions, and (iii) is strongly associated with the symptomology, onset, and development of human prion disease (PrD) and other insidious and incurable neurological syndromes.

Meanwhile, in several other conditions, related to intellectual function, a specific pattern of changes in electric brain activity, as recorded by quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) has been documented. We hypothesized, that in post-COVID brain fog, the subjective complaints may be accompanied by objective changes in the QEEG profile. In order to test this hypothesis, we have performed an exploratory study on the academic staff of our University with previous records of QEEG originating in the pre-COVID-19 era. Among them, 20 subjects who revealed neurological problems in the cognitive sphere (confirmed as covid fog/brain fog by a clinical specialist) after COVID-19 infection were identified. In those individuals, QEEG was performed. We observed, that opposite to baseline QEEG records, increased Theta and Alpha activity, as well as more intensive sensimotor rhythm (SMR) in C4 (right hemisphere) in relation to C3 (left hemisphere). Moreover, a visible increase in Beta 2 in relation to SMR in both hemispheres could be documented. Summarizing, we could demonstrate a clear change in QEEG activity patterns in individuals previously not affected by COVID-19 and now suffering from post-COVID-19 brain fog. These preliminary results warrant further interest in delineating their background. Here, both neuroinflammation and psychological stress, related to Sars-CoV2-infection may be considered.

As a result of being infected with the coronavirus, patients can experience long-term health effects called long COVID syndrome. Multiple symptoms characterize this syndrome, and it is crucial to identify these symptoms as they may negatively impact patients' day-to-day lives. Breathlessness, fatigue, and brain fog are the 3 most common continuing and debilitating symptoms that patients with long COVID have reported, often months after the onset of COVID-19. This study aimed to understand the patterns and behavior of long COVID symptoms reported by patients on the Twitter social media platform, which is vital to improving our understanding of long COVID. Long COVID-related Twitter data were collected from May 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. We used association rule mining techniques to identify frequent symptoms and establish relationships between symptoms among patients with long COVID in Twitter social media discussions. The highest confidence level-based detection was used to determine the most significant rules with 10% minimum confidence and 0.01% minimum support with a positive lift. Among the 30,327 tweets included in our study, the most frequent symptoms were brain fog (n=7812, 25.8%), fatigue (n=5284, 17.4%), breathing/lung issues (n=4750, 15.7%), heart issues (n=2900, 9.6%), flu symptoms (n=2824, 9.3%), depression (n=2256, 7.4%) and general pains (n=1786, 5.9%). Loss of smell and taste, cold, cough, chest pain, fever, headache, and arm pain emerged in 1.6% (n=474) to 5.3% (n=1616) of patients with long COVID. Furthermore, the highest confidence level-based detection successfully demonstrates the potential of association analysis and the Apriori algorithm to establish patterns to explore 57 meaningful relationship rules among long COVID symptoms. The strongest relationship revealed that patients with lung/breathing problems and loss of taste are likely to have a loss of smell with 77% confidence. There are very active social media discussions that could support the growing understanding of COVID-19 and its long-term impact. These discussions enable a potential field of research to analyze the behavior of long COVID syndrome. Exploratory data analysis using natural language processing methods revealed the symptoms and medical conditions related to long COVID discussions on the Twitter social media platform. Using Apriori algorithm-based association rules, we determined interesting and meaningful relationships between symptoms.","2022","2022 Sep 07","Surani Matharaarachchi; Mike Domaratzki; Alan Katz; Saman Muthukumarana","Department of Statistics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.; Department of Computer Science, Western University, London, ON, Canada.; Departments of Community Health Sciences and Family Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.; Department of Statistics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada."

This persistent state of ill health is known as Long COVID if it continues for more than three months and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Long Covid has been overlooked, especially in the low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we conducted an online survey among the COVID-19 survivors in the community to explore their Long COVID symptoms, factors associated with Long COVID and how Long COVID affected their work. A total of 732 COVID-19 survivors responded, with 56% were without or with mild symptoms during their acute COVID-19 conditions. One in five COVID-19 survivors reported of experiencing Long COVID. The most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue, brain fog, depression, anxiety and insomnia. Females had 58% higher odds (95% CI: 1.02, 2.45) of experiencing Long COVID. Patients with moderate and severe levels of acute COVID-19 symptoms had OR of 3.01 (95% CI: 1.21, 7.47) and 3.62 (95% CI: 1.31, 10.03) respectively for Long COVID.

Neither its etiopathogenesis, nor its clinical presentation or risk factors are fully understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the most common symptoms of long-COVID among patients from the STOP COVID registry of the PoLoCOV study, and to search for risk factors for development of the syndrome. The registry includes patients who presented to the medical center for persistent clinical symptoms following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The analysis included data from initial presentation and at three-month follow-up. Of the 2218 patients, 1569 (70.7%) reported having at least one symptom classified as long-COVID syndrome three months after recovery from the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most common symptoms included chronic fatigue (35.6%\), cough (23.0%), and a set of neurological symptoms referred to as brain fog (12.1%). Risk factors for developing long-COVID syndrome included female gender (odds ratio [OR]: 1.48, 95% confidence intervals [CI] [1.19-1.84]), severe COVID-19 (OR: 1.56, CI: 1.00-2.42), dyspnea (OR: 1.31, CI: 1.02-1.69), and chest pain (OR: 1.48, CI: 1.14-1.92).

Patients with long COVID olfactory dysfunction were allocated to different groups based on the presence (""previously treated"") or absence (""naïve"") of prior exposure to olfactory training. Patients were then randomized to receive PEA-LUT alone or in combination with olfactory training. Olfactory function and memory were assessed at monthly intervals using self-report measures and quantitative thresholds. A total of 69 patients (43 women, 26 men) with an age average of 40.6 + 10.5 were recruited.

These ""long COVID"" symptoms, also referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), can persist for months after infection without any effective treatments. Long COVID involves a complex heterogenous symptomology and can lead to disability and limit work. Long COVID symptoms may be due to sustained inflammatory responses and prolonged immune response after infection. Interestingly, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may have anti-inflammatory effects, however, until recently, VNS could not be self-administered, at-home, noninvasively. We created a double-blind, noninvasive transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) system that can be self-administered at home with simultaneous remote monitoring of physiological biomarkers and video supervision by study staff. Subsequently, we carried out a pilot (n = 13) randomized, sham-controlled, trial with this system for four weeks to treat nine predefined long covid symptoms (anxiety, depression, vertigo, anosmia, ageusia, headaches, fatigue, irritability, brain fog). No in-person patient contact was needed, with informed consent, trainings, ratings, and all procedures being conducted remotely during the pandemic (2020-2021) and equipment being shipped to individuals' homes. This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier: NCT04638673 registered November 20, 2020. Four-weeks of at-home self-administered taVNS (two, one-hour sessions daily, delivered at suprathreshold intensities) was feasible and safe. Although our trial was not powered to determine efficacy as an intervention in a heterogenous population, the trends in the data suggest taVNS may have a mild to moderate effect in reducing mental fatigue symptoms in a subset of individuals. This innovative study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of supervised self-administered taVNS under a fully contactless protocol and suggests that future studies can safely investigate this novel form of brain stimulation at-home for a variety of neuropsychiatric and motor recovery applications.","2022","2022 Aug 25","Bashar W Badran; Sarah M Huffman; Morgan Dancy; Christopher W Austelle; Marom Bikson; Steven A Kautz; Mark S George","Neuro-X Lab, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.

No specific intervention exists to mitigate this burden. This study tested the hypothesis, inspired by recent experimental research, that post-COVID cognitive deficits can be prevented by inhibiting receptor-interacting protein kinase. Using electronic health record data, we compared the cognitive outcomes of propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with epilepsy taking phenytoin (a commonly used receptor-interacting protein kinase inhibitor) versus valproate or levetiracetam at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients taking phenytoin at the time of COVID-19 were at a significantly lower risk of cognitive deficits in the 6 months after COVID-19 infection than a matched cohort of patients receiving levetiracetam (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.63-0.97, P = 0.024) or valproate (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.93, P = 0.011). In secondary analyses, results were robust when controlling for subtype of epilepsy, and showed specificity to cognitive deficits in that similar associations were not seen with other 'long-COVID' outcomes such as persistent breathlessness or pain. These findings provide pharmacoepidemiological support for the hypothesis that receptor-interacting protein kinase signaling is involved in post-COVID cognitive deficits. These results should prompt empirical investigations of receptor-interacting protein kinase inhibitors in the prevention of post-COVID cognitive deficits.","2022","2022","Maxime Taquet; Paul J Harrison","Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."

Despite the prevalence of the specific chronic symptoms between male and females showed no significant differences, the total number of females accessing our service was higher than that of males, confirming the higher prevalence of Neuro-Long-COVID in female individuals. Conversely, a worse acute phase response in males rather than females was confirmed by a significant difference in the rates of acute respiratory symptoms (p = 0.008), dyspnea (p = 0.018), respiratory failure (p = 0.010) and the consequent need for ventilation (p = 0.015), together with other acute symptoms such as palpitations (p = 0.049), headache (p = 0.001) and joint pain (p = 0.049).

Cognitive deficits have been measured exclusively in the upright body position and mainly comprised impairments of higher cognitive functions. The cause of brain fog is still unclear today. This study aimed to investigate whether increased autonomic activation might be an underlying mechanism for the occurrence of brain fog in neuropathic POTS. We therefore investigated cognitive function in patients with neuropathic POTS and a healthy control group depending on body position and in relation to catecholamine release as a sensitive indicator of acute stress. The second aim was to test the effect of water intake on cardiovascular regulation, orthostatic symptoms, cognitive function and catecholamine release. Thirteen patients with neuropathic POTS and 15 healthy control subjects were included. All participants completed a total of four rounds of cognitive testing: two before and two after the intake of 500 ml still water, each first in the supine position and then during head-up tilt. At the end of each cognitive test, a blood sample was collected for determination of plasma catecholamines. After each head-up tilt phase participants were asked to rate their current symptoms on a visual analogue scale. Working memory performance in the upright body position was impaired in patients, which was associated with self-reported symptom severity. Patients had elevated plasma norepinephrine independent of body position and water intake that increased excessively in the upright body position. The excessive increase of plasma norepinephrine was related to heart rate and symptom severity. Water intake in patients decreased norepinephrine concentrations and heart rate, and improved symptoms as well as cognitive performance. Brain fog and symptom severity in neuropathic POTS are paralleled by an excessive norepinephrine secretion. Bolus water drinking down-regulates norepinephrine secretion and improves general symptom severity including brain fog.","2022","2022","Belén Rodriguez; Annie Hochstrasser; Philippe J Eugster; Eric Grouzmann; René M Müri; Werner J Z'Graggen","Department of Neurosurgery, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Neurology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Service of Clinical Pharmacology, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Service of Clinical Pharmacology, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Neurology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Gerontechnology and Rehabilitation Group, ARTORG Center for Biomedical Engineering Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Neurosurgery, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Neurology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland."

Psychiatry","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Brain Ischemia; COVID-19; Child; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Female; Humans; Ischemic Stroke; Male; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Seizures; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Stroke","","COVID-19 is associated with increased risks of neurological and psychiatric sequelae in the weeks and months thereafter. How long these risks remain, whether they affect children and adults similarly, and whether SARS-CoV-2 variants differ in their risk profiles remains unclear. In this analysis of 2-year retrospective cohort studies, we extracted data from the TriNetX electronic health records network, an international network of de-identified data from health-care records of approximately 89 million patients collected from hospital, primary care, and specialist providers (mostly from the USA, but also from Australia, the UK, Spain, Bulgaria, India, Malaysia, and Taiwan). A cohort of patients of any age with COVID-19 diagnosed between Jan 20, 2020, and April 13, 2022, was identified and propensity-score matched (1:1) to a contemporaneous cohort of patients with any other respiratory infection. Matching was done on the basis of demographic factors, risk factors for COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 illness, and vaccination status. Analyses were stratified by age group (age <18 years [children], 18-64 years [adults], and ≥65 years [older adults]) and date of diagnosis. We assessed the risks of 14 neurological and psychiatric diagnoses after SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared these risks with the matched comparator cohort. The 2-year risk trajectories were represented by time-varying hazard ratios (HRs) and summarised using the 6-month constant HRs (representing the risks in the earlier phase of follow-up, which have not yet been well characterised in children), the risk horizon for each outcome (ie, the time at which the HR returns to 1), and the time to equal incidence in the two cohorts. We also estimated how many people died after a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis during follow-up in each age group. Finally, we compared matched cohorts of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 directly before and after the emergence of the alpha (B.1.1.7), delta (B.1.617.2), and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants. We identified 1 487 712 patients with a recorded diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period, of whom 1 284 437 (185 748 children, 856 588 adults, and 242 101 older adults; overall mean age 42·5 years [SD 21·9]; 741 806 [57·8%] were female and 542 192 [42·2%] were male) were adequately matched with an equal number of patients with another respiratory infection. The risk trajectories of outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the whole cohort differed substantially. While most outcomes had HRs significantly greater than 1 after 6 months (with the exception of encephalitis; Guillain-Barré syndrome; nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorder; and parkinsonism), their risk horizons and time to equal incidence varied greatly. Risks of the common psychiatric disorders returned to baseline after 1-2 months (mood disorders at 43 days, anxiety disorders at 58 days) and subsequently reached an equal overall incidence to the matched comparison group (mood disorders at 457 days, anxiety disorders at 417 days). By contrast, risks of cognitive deficit (known as brain fog), dementia, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or seizures were still increased at the end of the 2-year follow-up period. Post-COVID-19 risk trajectories differed in children compared with adults: in the 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, children were not at an increased risk of mood (HR 1·02 [95% CI 0·94-1·10) or anxiety (1·00 [0·94-1·06]) disorders, but did have an increased risk of cognitive deficit, insomnia, intracranial haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or seizures (HRs ranging from 1·20 [1·09-1·33] to 2·16 [1·46-3·19]). Unlike adults, cognitive deficit in children had a finite risk horizon (75 days) and a finite time to equal incidence (491 days). A sizeable proportion of older adults who received a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis, in either cohort, subsequently died, especially those diagnosed with dementia or epilepsy or seizures. Risk profiles were similar just before versus just after the emergence of the alpha variant (n=47 675 in each cohort). Just after (vs just before) the emergence of the delta variant (n=44 835 in each cohort), increased risks of ischaemic stroke, epilepsy or seizures, cognitive deficit, insomnia, and anxiety disorders were observed, compounded by an increased death rate. With omicron (n=39 845 in each cohort), there was a lower death rate than just before emergence of the variant, but the risks of neurological and psychiatric outcomes remained similar. This analysis of 2-year retrospective cohort studies of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 showed that the increased incidence of mood and anxiety disorders was transient, with no overall excess of these diagnoses compared with other respiratory infections. In contrast, the increased risk of psychotic disorder, cognitive deficit, dementia, and epilepsy or seizures persisted throughout. The differing trajectories suggest a different pathogenesis for these outcomes. Children have a more benign overall profile of psychiatric risk than do adults and older adults, but their sustained higher risk of some diagnoses is of concern. The fact that neurological and psychiatric outcomes were similar during the delta and omicron waves indicates that the burden on the health-care system might continue even with variants that are less severe in other respects.

A retrospective chart analysis of patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia in the years 2015-2020 was performed. The values of B12 were collected. The chart reviews assessed reported fatigue and neurologic symptoms, including brain fog, memory loss, cognitive impairment, paresthesias, numbness, and tingling, to assess their correlation with B12 levels. Concurrent vitamin D and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were reviewed to assess their association with fibromyalgia. A total of 2142 patients with fibromyalgia with documented levels of B12 and vitamin D were included. Of them, 42.4% had B12 deficiency (<400 ng/L). Fatigue and memory loss were more common in the B12 deficiency group. After adjusting for vitamin D levels, B12 deficiency remained statistically significantly associated with the presence of fatigue (odds ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.75; P=.004). This is the first study to report the association of B12 in patients with fibromyalgia complaining of fatigue.

A Long COVID/PASC Registry was subsequently established as an online platform where patients can report Long COVID/PASC symptoms and previous comorbidities. In this study, we report on the comorbidities and persistent symptoms, using data obtained from 845 South African Long COVID/PASC patients. By using a previously published scoring system for fibrin amyloid microclots and platelet pathology, we also analysed blood samples from 80 patients, and report the presence of significant fibrin amyloid microclots and platelet pathology in all cases. Hypertension, high cholesterol levels (dyslipidaemia), cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were found to be the most important comorbidities. The gender balance (70% female) and the most commonly reported Long COVID/PASC symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, loss of concentration and forgetfulness, shortness of breath, as well as joint and muscle pains) were comparable to those reported elsewhere. These findings confirmed that our sample was not atypical. Microclot and platelet pathologies were associated with Long COVID/PASC symptoms that persisted after the recovery from acute COVID-19. Fibrin amyloid microclots that block capillaries and inhibit the transport of O2 to tissues, accompanied by platelet hyperactivation, provide a ready explanation for the symptoms of Long COVID/PASC. Removal and reversal of these underlying endotheliopathies provide an important treatment option that urgently warrants controlled clinical studies to determine efficacy in patients with a diversity of comorbidities impacting on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. We suggest that our platelet and clotting grading system provides a simple and cost-effective diagnostic method for early detection of Long COVID/PASC as a major determinant of effective treatment, including those focusing on reducing clot burden and platelet hyperactivation.","2022","2022 Aug 06","Etheresia Pretorius; Chantelle Venter; Gert Jacobus Laubscher; Maritha J Kotze; Sunday O Oladejo; Liam R Watson; Kanshu Rajaratnam; Bruce W Watson; Douglas B Kell","Department of Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Stellenbosch University, Private Bag X1, Matieland, Stellenbosch, 7602, South Africa. resiap@sun.ac.za.; Department of Biochemistry and Systems Biology, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 7ZB, UK. resiap@sun.ac.za.; Department of Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Stellenbosch University, Private Bag X1, Matieland, Stellenbosch, 7602, South Africa.; Mediclinic Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, 7600, South Africa.; Division of Chemical Pathology, Department of Pathology, National Health Laboratory Service, Tygerberg Hospital & Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, 8000, South Africa.; Centre for AI Research, School for Data-Science & Computational Thinking, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, 7600, South Africa.; Centre for AI Research, School for Data-Science & Computational Thinking, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, 7600, South Africa.; Centre for AI Research, School for Data-Science & Computational Thinking, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, 7600, South Africa.; Centre for AI Research, School for Data-Science & Computational Thinking, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, 7600, South Africa.; Department of Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Stellenbosch University, Private Bag X1, Matieland, Stellenbosch, 7602, South Africa. dbk@liv.ac.uk.; Department of Biochemistry and Systems Biology, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 7ZB, UK. dbk@liv.ac.uk.; The Novo Nordisk Foundation Centre for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark, Kemitorvet 200, 2800, Kgs Lyngby, Denmark. dbk@liv.ac.uk."

A better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 at the genetic level would help combat COVID-19, particularly for long COVID. We performed a genetic analysis of ACE2 and searched for its common potential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequency >0.05 in both European and Chinese populations that would contribute to ACE2 gene expression variation. We thought that the variation of the ACE2 expression would be an important biological feature that would strongly affect COVID-19 symptoms, such as ""brain fog"", which is highlighted by the fact that ACE2 acts as a major cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 attachment and is highly expressed in brain tissues. Based on the human GTEx gene expression database, we found rs2106809 exhibited a significant correlation with the ACE2 expression among multiple brain and artery tissues. This expression correlation was replicated in an independent European brain eQTL database, Braineac. rs2106809*G also displays significantly higher frequency in Asian populations than in Europeans and displays a protective effect (p = 0.047) against COVID-19 hospitalization when comparing hospitalized COVID-19 cases with non-hospitalized COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 test-negative samples with European ancestry from the UK Biobank. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrated that rs2106809*G could upregulate the transcriptional activity of ACE2. Therefore, integrative analysis and functional experiment strongly support that ACE2 SNP rs2106809 is a functional brain eQTL and its potential involvement in long COVID, which warrants further investigation.","2022","2022","Yu-Si Luo; Lei Luo; Wei Li; Yan Chen; Guo-Feng Wu; Fang Chen; Hu-Yan Shen; Hong-Man Li; Ming-Yang Guo; Sha Yin; Ke Zhang; Zhong-Shan Cheng","Department of Emergency, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.; The Key and Characteristic Laboratory of Modern Pathogenicity Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.; Good Clinical Practice Center, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital, Guiyang, China.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.; The High Efficacy Application of Natural Medicinal Resources Engineering Center of Guizhou Province, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.; Department of Emergency, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.; The Key and Characteristic Laboratory of Modern Pathogenicity Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.; The Key and Characteristic Laboratory of Modern Pathogenicity Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.; Department of Hypertension, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.; The Key and Characteristic Laboratory of Modern Pathogenicity Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.; Good Clinical Practice Center, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital, Guiyang, China.; The Key and Characteristic Laboratory of Modern Pathogenicity Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.; Center for Applied Bioinformatics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States."

Several imaging studies have shown that long COVID cases present with decreased glucose metabolism and progressive brain atrophy. Although no single pathological hypothesis thoroughly explains the varied clinical presentations and timings, the following have attracted attention: 1) persistent viral infection, 2) persistent inflammation, 3) involvement of the autoimmune system, and 4) mitochondrial dysfunction. In all these hypotheses, inflammatory cytokines may be involved in orthostatic dysregulation by decreasing the expression and activity of ACE2, consequently changing the blood pressure through vagus nerve hyperactivation. Myopathy and peripheral neuropathy may also be caused by direct infection of the muscles and nerves, hypoxia, mitochondrial damage, and cytokine storm. Furthermore, multiple theories regarding the mechanisms by which systemic inflammatory findings affect the central nervous system have been postulated, including neuroinflammation caused by inflammatory cells crossing the blood-brain barrier via choroid plexus cells and the involvement of various autoantibodies.

Common diagnostic laboratory tests are often unrevealing. We evaluated whether a simple, standardized, office-based test of OI, the 10-min NASA Lean Test (NLT), would aggravate symptoms and produce objective hemodynamic and cognitive abnormalities, the latter being evaluated by a simple smart phone-based app. People with Long COVID (N = 42), ME/CFS (N = 26) and healthy control subjects (N = 20) were studied just before, during, immediately after, 2 and 7 days following completion of the NLT. The NLT provoked a worsening of symptoms in the two patient groups but not in healthy control subjects, and the severity of all symptoms was similar and significantly worse in the two patient groups than in the control subjects (p < 0.001). In the two patient groups, particularly those with Long COVID, the NLT provoked a marked and progressive narrowing in the pulse pressure.

A test of orthostatic stress easily performed in an office setting reveals different symptomatic, hemodynamic and cognitive abnormalities in people with Long COVID and ME/CFS, compared to healthy control subjects. Thus, an orthostatic challenge easily performed in an office setting, and the use of a smart phone app to assess cognition, can provide objective confirmation of the orthostatic intolerance and brain fog reported by patients with Long COVID and ME/CFS.","2022","2022","Suzanne D Vernon; Sherlyn Funk; Lucinda Bateman; Gregory J Stoddard; Sarah Hammer; Karen Sullivan; Jennifer Bell; Saeed Abbaszadeh; W Ian Lipkin; Anthony L Komaroff","The Bateman Horne Center of Excellence, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.; Department of Family & Preventive Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.; The Bateman Horne Center of Excellence, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.; Department of Family & Preventive Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.; The Bateman Horne Center of Excellence, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.; The Bateman Horne Center of Excellence, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.; The Bateman Horne Center of Excellence, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.; The Bateman Horne Center of Excellence, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.; Center for Solutions for ME/CFS, Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Division of General Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."

The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence of co-existing symptoms and self-reported syndrome diagnoses among women with PCS and to inform future research hypotheses. A brief online survey was offered to members of a PCS support group website. Responses were assessed for self-reported co-existing symptoms and formal diagnoses, including: chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, postural tachycardia syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, migraines, interstitial cystitis, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Of a total of 6000 members, there were 398 respondents; 232 (59%) had not yet been treated for PCS. Among these, the most prevalent co-existing symptoms were as follows: severe fatigue (72%), dizziness (63%), IBS symptoms (61%), brain fog (33%), migraines (49%), polyuria or dysuria (41%), excessive sweating (31%), TMJ pain (31%), and loose skin or lax joints (18%). These are much higher than reported for the general female population. The most commonly self-reported comorbid syndrome diagnoses for the overall group of 398 were: irritable bowel syndrome (29%), fibromyalgia (13%), spinal nerve problems (18%), interstitial cystitis (10%), postural tachycardia syndrome (9%), hypertension (11%), chronic fatigue syndrome (10%), and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (6%). Other than with hypertension, these rates are variably higher than in the general population. Several self-reported co-existing symptoms and syndromes are more prevalent in members of a PCS support group relative to the reported prevalence in the general population. More formal investigation is warranted to evaluate this finding and to investigate potential etiologic links. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome appears to be common in self identifying PCS women.","2022","2022 Sep","Steven J Smith; Michael Sichlau; Luke E Sewall; B Holly Smith; Brenda Chen; Neal Khurana; Peter C Rowe","482281Vascular and Interventional Professionals, LLC, Hinsdale, IL, USA.; 482281Vascular and Interventional Professionals, LLC, Hinsdale, IL, USA.; 482281Vascular and Interventional Professionals, LLC, Hinsdale, IL, USA.; Center for the Advanced Study of Human Paleobiology, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.; University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Vascular and Interventional Specialists of Siouxland, Dakota Dunes, ND, USA.; Dept of Pediatrics, 1466Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA."
"461","35765566","A pilot randomized controlled trial of supervised, at-home, self-administered transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) to manage long COVID symptoms.","Research square","","","Background Although the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has now impacted the world for over two years, the persistent secondary neuropsychiatric effects are still not fully understood. These ""long COVID"" symptoms, also referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), can persist for months after infection without any effective treatments. Long COVID involves a complex heterogenous symptomology and can lead to disability and limit work. Long COVID symptoms may be due to sustained inflammatory responses and prolonged immune response after infection. Interestingly, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may have anti-inflammatory effects, however, until recently, VNS could not be self-administered, at-home, noninvasively. Methods We created a double-blind, noninvasive transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) system that can be self-administered at home with simultaneous remote monitoring of physiological biomarkers and video supervision by study staff. Subsequently, we carried out a pilot (n = 13) randomized, sham-controlled, trial with this system for four weeks to treat nine predefined long covid symptoms (anxiety, depression, vertigo, anosmia, ageusia, headaches, fatigue, irritability, brain fog). No in-person patient contact was needed, with informed consent, trainings, ratings, and all procedures being conducted remotely during the pandemic (2020-2021) and equipment being shipped to individuals' homes. This trial was registered onClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier: NCT04638673. Results Four-weeks of at-home self-administered taVNS (two, one-hour sessions daily, delivered at suprathreshold intensities) was feasible and safe. Although our trial was not powered to determine efficacy as an intervention in a heterogenous population, the trends in the data suggest taVNS may have a mild to moderate effect in reducing mental fatigue symptoms in a subset of individuals. This innovative study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of supervised self-administered taVNS under a fully contactless protocol and suggests that future studies can safely investigate this novel form of brain stimulation at-home for a variety of neuropsychiatric and motor recovery applications.","2022","2022 Jun 21","Bashar W Badran; Sarah M Huffman; Morgan Dancy; Christopher W Austelle; Marom Bikson; Steven A Kautz; Mark S George","Medical University of South Carolina.; Medical University of South Carolina.; Medical University of South Carolina.; Medical University of South Carolina.; City College of the City University of New York: The City College of New York.; Medical University of South Carolina.; Medical University of South Carolina."

The aim of this study was to explore perimenopausal women's attitudes and knowledge of the menopause. An online survey was designed to evaluate attitudes and knowledge of the menopause in women older than 40 years. The survey was generated with Qualtrics XM® and promoted via social media. In all, 3150 women started the survey. In this study, data from 947 perimenopausal women were analysed. Regarding women's attitudes to the menopause, 38.8% were accepting of it but more than 30% were dreading it. The women had experienced a number of menopause symptoms including mood swings (68.9%), brain fog (68.3%), and fatigue (66.8%). More than 90% of women had never been taught about the menopause at school, and more than 60% did not feel informed at all about the menopause. School was thought to be the best place for menopause education to start (83.6%). In all, 68.2% of women had only looked for information about the menopause as their symptoms started and they had talked to friends and used a variety of websites to look for information. When asked for their free-text views on the menopause, thematic analysis produced four themes: the overarching knowledge gap, the onset and impact of symptoms, perimenopause: the hidden phenomenon, and managing symptoms: differing schools of thought. Lack of education for women and their general practitioners is causing perimenopausal women to go through this important stage in their lives with a lack of knowledge and appropriate medical care. It is essential that women are taught about the menopause, from school onwards and that we offer health professionals appropriate training starting from the medical school curriculum.","2022","2022 Jan-Dec","Joyce C Harper; Samantha Phillips; Rina Biswakarma; Ephia Yasmin; Ertan Saridogan; Sheila Radhakrishnan; Melanie C Davies; Vikram Talaulikar","EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London, London, UK.; EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London, London, UK.; Institute of Education, University College London, London, UK.; Reproductive Medicine Unit, University College Hospital, London, UK.; Reproductive Medicine Unit, University College Hospital, London, UK.; Royal Free Medical School, London, UK.; Reproductive Medicine Unit, University College Hospital, London, UK.; Reproductive Medicine Unit, University College Hospital, London, UK."

In this study, a comprehensive clinical characterisation of self-reported brain fog was conducted vis-à-vis other long COVID symptoms and parameters of mental, cognitive, and physical health. (2) Methodology: Adult participants reporting long COVID symptoms were recruited from hospital clinics and as self-referrals. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires and clinical assessments, including COVID-19 history, symptomatology, self-reported scales (Chalder Fatigue Scale [CFQ], Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and Impact of Events Scale-Revised), computer-based cognitive assessments (simple response time and choice reaction time tasks), physical performance tests (gait velocity and muscle strength assessments), and an orthostatic active stand test. A systematic comparison between participants with and without self-reported brain fog was conducted, and a backwards binary logistic regression model was computed to identify the strongest independent associations with brain fog. This was complemented by an automatic cluster analysis to rank the importance of associations. Finally, a structural equation model was postulated with a causal model of key symptomatic indicators and functional consequences of brain fog as a latent variable. (3) Results: Of 108 participants assessed, brain fog was a self-reported symptom in 71 (65.7%) participants. Those with brain fog were at a longer point in time since COVID-19 onset and reported longer duration of low activity during the acute illness. When assessed, those with brain fog had higher frequencies of subjective memory impairment, word-finding difficulties, dizziness, myalgia, arthralgia, hyperhidrosis, cough, voice weakness, throat pain, visual and hearing problems, dysosmia, paraesthesia, chest pain, skin rashes, and hair loss; mean scores in fatigue, depression, and post-traumatic stress scales were higher; performance in both computer-based cognitive tasks was poorer; and measured gait speed and grip strength were lower. The logistic regression suggested that the best independent associations with brain fog were memory impairment, CFQ, and myalgia. The cluster analysis suggested that the most important associations with brain fog were CFQ, dizziness, myalgia, reduced gait speed, word-finding difficulties, reduced grip strength, and memory impairment. The SEM was consistent with key indicators of brain fog being CFQ, dizziness, myalgia, word-finding difficulties, and memory impairment; and reduced grip strength, gait speed, and cognitive response times its functional consequences. (4) Conclusions: The findings indicate that self-reported brain fog in long COVID is a recognisable symptom cluster primarily characterised by fatigue, dizziness, myalgia, word-finding difficulties, and memory impairment and has adverse psychological and psychomotor correlates. In long COVID, brain fog should be regarded as a wide-ranging symptom and addressed holistically with medical, psychological, and rehabilitative supports as guided by individual needs.","2022","2022 Jun 15","Glenn Jennings; Ann Monaghan; Feng Xue; Eoin Duggan; Román Romero-Ortuño","School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, D02 R590 Dublin, Ireland.; School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, D02 R590 Dublin, Ireland.; School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, D02 R590 Dublin, Ireland.; School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, D02 R590 Dublin, Ireland.; Mercer's Institute for Successful Ageing, St. James's Hospital, D08 N80H Dublin, Ireland.; School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, D02 R590 Dublin, Ireland.; Mercer's Institute for Successful Ageing, St. James's Hospital, D08 N80H Dublin, Ireland.; Global Brain Health Institute, Trinity College Dublin, D02 R590 Dublin, Ireland."

The list of disease symptoms, and postmortem observations is too long to mention; however, SARS-CoV-2 has brought with it a whole new clinical syndrome in ""long haulers"" including dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia, brain fog, exercise intolerance, and extreme fatigue. We opine that further improvement in delivering effective treatment, and preventive strategies would be benefited from validated animal disease models. In this context, we designed a study, and show that a genetically engineered mouse expressing the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2; ACE-2 (the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 agent to enter host cells) represents an excellent investigative resource in simulating important clinical features of the COVID-19. The ACE-2 mouse model (which is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2) when administered with a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP) intranasally exhibited a profound cytokine storm capable of altering the physiological parameters including significant changes in cardiac function along with multi-organ damage that was further confirmed via histological findings. More importantly, visceral organs from SP treated mice revealed thrombotic blood clots as seen during postmortem examination. Thus, the ACE-2 engineered mouse appears to be a suitable model for studying intimate viral pathogenesis thus paving the way for identification, and characterization of appropriate prophylactics as well as therapeutics for COVID-19 management.","2023","2023 Jan","Mahavir Singh; Sathnur Pushpakumar; Nia Bard; Yuting Zheng; Rubens P Homme; Sri Prakash L Mokshagundam; Suresh C Tyagi","Department of Physiology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, 40202, USA. mahavir.singh@louisville.edu.; Department of Physiology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, 40202, USA.; Department of Physiology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, 40202, USA.; Department of Physiology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, 40202, USA.; Department of Physiology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, 40202, USA.; Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes and Robley Rex VA Medical Center, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, 40202, USA.; Department of Physiology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, 40202, USA."

Thirty-two CFS and eighteen healthy controls (HC) participated in 2 weeks of a SS + WBC programme. This programme was composed of five sessions per week, 10 sessions in total. A significant decrease in fatigue was noted in the CFS group in response to SS + WBC. Some domains of cognitive functioning (speed of processing visual information and set-shifting) also improved in response to SS + WBC in both CFS and HC groups. Our study has confirmed that WBC is well tolerated by those with CFS and leads to symptomatic improvements associated with changes in cardiovascular and autonomic function. Given the preliminary data showing the beneficial effect of cryotherapy, its relative ease of application, good tolerability, and proven safety, therapy with cold exposure appears to be an approach worth attention. Further studies of cryotherapy as a potential treatment in CFS is important in the light of the lack of effective therapeutic options for these common and often disabling symptoms.","2022","2022 Jun 17","Sławomir Kujawski; Joanna Słomko; Beata R Godlewska; Agnieszka Cudnoch-Jędrzejewska; Modra Murovska; Julia L Newton; Łukasz Sokołowski; Paweł Zalewski","Department of Exercise Physiology and Functional Anatomy, Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Świętojańska 20, 85-077, Bydgoszcz, Poland. skujawski@cm.umk.pl.; Department of Exercise Physiology and Functional Anatomy, Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Świętojańska 20, 85-077, Bydgoszcz, Poland.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7JX, UK.; Department of Experimental and Clinical Physiology, Laboratory of Centre for Preclinical Research, Warsaw Medical University, 1b Banacha Street, 02-097, Warsaw, Poland.; Institute of Microbiology and Virology, Riga Stradinš University, Riga, 1067, Latvia.; Population Health Sciences Institute, The Medical School, Newcastle University, Framlington Place, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK.; Department of Exercise Physiology and Functional Anatomy, Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Świętojańska 20, 85-077, Bydgoszcz, Poland.; Department of Exercise Physiology and Functional Anatomy, Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Świętojańska 20, 85-077, Bydgoszcz, Poland.; Department of Experimental and Clinical Physiology, Laboratory of Centre for Preclinical Research, Warsaw Medical University, 1b Banacha Street, 02-097, Warsaw, Poland."

Research has shown these events produce a systemic molecular inflammatory response and chronic immune activation and dysregulation. What has been more difficult to establish is the hierarchy of the physiological responses that give rise to the myriad of symptoms that ME/CFS patients experience, and why they do not resolve and are generally life-long. The severity of the symptoms frequently fluctuates through relapse recovery periods, with brain-centered symptoms of neuroinflammation, loss of homeostatic control, ""brain fog"" affecting cognitive ability, lack of refreshing sleep, and poor response to even small stresses. How these brain effects develop with ME/CFS from the initiating external effector, whether virus or other cause, is poorly understood and that is what our paper aims to address. We propose the hypothesis that following the initial stressor event, the subsequent systemic pathology moves to the brain via neurovascular pathways or through a dysfunctional blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in chronic neuroinflammation and leading to a sustained illness with chronic relapse recovery cycles. Signaling through recognized pathways from the brain back to body physiology is likely part of the process by which the illness cycle in the peripheral system is sustained and why healing does not occur. By contrast, Long COVID (Post-COVID-19 condition) is a very recent ME/CFS-like illness arising from the single pandemic virus, SARS-CoV-2. We believe the ME/CFS-like ongoing effects of Long COVID are arising by very similar mechanisms involving neuroinflammation, but likely with some unique signaling, resulting from the pathology of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The fact that there are very similar symptoms in both ongoing diseases, despite the diversity in the nature of the initial stressors, supports the concept of a similar dysfunctional CNS component common to both.","2022","2022","Warren Tate; Max Walker; Eiren Sweetman; Amber Helliwell; Katie Peppercorn; Christina Edgar; Anna Blair; Aniruddha Chatterjee","Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.; Brain Health Research Centre, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.; Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.; Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.; School of Biological Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.; Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.; Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.; Brain Health Research Centre, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.; Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.; Graduate School of Health, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Department of Pathology, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand."

Data were collected retrospectively (between February 2020 and May 2021) from a cohort (N=100) within a COVID-19 survivors study of patients with persistent symptoms enrolled after a short inpatient stay or who had been outpatients never hospitalized. Patients without confirmatory positive PCR or antibody diagnostic test results were grouped separately as presumptive cases (N=13). Of the 87 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 63 (72.4%) were female, and 65 (74.7%) were White. The mean age was 49.2 years (SD=14.9). The most prevalent symptoms after COVID-19 infection were fatigue, ""brain fog,"" headache, anxiety, and sleep issues. Attention and executive function were frequently impaired. The mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 26.0 (SD=2.8). Concentration and attention as well as memory issues were both significantly correlated with the complaint of brain fog.

No uniformly established therapy exists; neurofeedback studies report treatment value. We use infralow frequency neuromodulation (ILF) to remediate disabling neurological symptoms caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI) and noted improved outcomes with a novel concussion protocol. Postconcussion symptoms (PCS) and persistent postconcussion symptoms (PPCS; >3 months post head injury) are designated timelines for protracted neurological complaints following TBI. We performed a retrospective study to explore effectiveness of ILF in PCS/PPCS and investigated the value of using this concussion protocol. Patients with PCS/PPCS seen for their first neurology office visit or received their first neurofeedback session between 1 August 2018 and 31 January 2021 were entered. Outcomes were compared following treatment as usual (TAU) vs. TAU with ILF neurotherapy (TAU+ILF). The study cohort was limited to PPCS patients; the TAU+ILF group was restricted further to PPCS patients receiving at least 10 neurotherapy sessions. Within the TAU+ILF group, comparisons were made between those who trained at least 10 sessions using concussion protocol (TAU+ILF+CP) and those who trained for at least 10 sessions of ILF regardless of protocol (TAU+ILF-CP). Among our resultant PPCS cohort (n = 59) leading persistent neurological complaints were headache (67.8%), memory impairment (57.6%), and brain fog (50.8%). PPCS patients in TAU+ILF+CP (n = 25) demonstrated greater net (p = 0.004) and percent (p = 0.026) improvement of symptoms compared to PPCS subjects in TAU (n = 26). PPCS patients in TAU+ILF-CP (n = 8) trended toward significant symptom improvements compared to TAU, and TAU+ILF+CP trended toward greater efficacy than TAU+ILF-CP. PPCS patients who received TAU+ILF+CP demonstrated significantly greater improvement as a group when compared to TAU. When used as an integrative modality to treatment as usual in managing patients with PPCS, ILF neuromodulation with use of concussion protocol provided significant symptom improvements.","2022","2022","Stella B Legarda; Caroline E Lahti; Dana McDermott; Andreas Michas-Martin","Neurology, Montage Health, Montage Medical Group, Monterey, CA, United States.; Neurology, Montage Health, Montage Medical Group, Monterey, CA, United States.; Neurology, Montage Health, Montage Medical Group, Monterey, CA, United States.; Neurology, Montage Health, Montage Medical Group, Monterey, CA, United States."
"471","35677013","COVID-19 Infection: Its Lingering Symptoms in Adults.","Cureus","","lingering symptoms covid; long covid; long term side effects covid; long-covid-19; long-haul covid","Background Recent studies showed that a significant percentage of people who recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had lingering symptoms. Among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, studies showed persistent symptoms both in patients hospitalized and in outpatient settings. In the studies done in the outpatient setting involving mild to moderate COVID-19 patients, there were significant variations regarding the exact percentage of people with lingering symptoms. Also, in the outpatient setting, not many studies were done on COVID-19 patients that assessed risk factors for having lingering symptoms. Given that a large percentage of people infected with COVID-19 infection do not get hospitalized, it is imperative that this lacuna be filled. We believe knowing the details of long-term symptoms of COVID-19 infection both from prevalence and predictors point of view, could allow the physicians, healthcare system and community to better prepare for managing and following these patients. Materials and methods Our study period was within 12 months after the first documented case of COVID-19 occurred in the State of Alabama. Our study population included patients who were diagnosed with a documented case of COVID-19 in this time period and were under the care of a single primary care provider at an ambulatory clinic. Among 80 patients who had documented COVID-19, three left the practice, two declined to participate in the study and three were deceased (two due to COVID-19 and one for other reasons). Therefore, the study population constituted 72 patients. A questionnaire was mailed to all 72 patients to see how many of them had symptoms three months and beyond of having COVID-19 infection. A chart review was conducted for the study participants to assess for ""Comorbid conditions"", health conditions that were considered conclusively high risk for acute COVID-19 infection by US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results Fifty-three patients responded to the questionnaire; 27 patients (50.9%) reported lingering symptoms beyond three months of diagnosis with COVID-19 infection. The three most common symptoms reported were fatigue (56%), brain fog (48%), and shortness of breath (41%). The results also showed that women are more likely than men to have lingering symptoms. ""Elderly"" (≥65 years) patients were as likely as 18-64 years old patients to have lingering symptoms and the presence of one or more of the ""Comorbid conditions"" does not have any bearing on the occurrence of lingering symptoms. Conclusion Future studies should be done in a larger population to assess the findings that our study showed regarding ""elderly"" age and the presence of one or more ""comorbid conditions"" being independent variables of the occurrence of prolonged COVID-19 symptoms. We recommend studies be done assessing the prevalence and predictors for the long-term effects of the COVID-19 infection. This knowledge could help in preventing those long-term symptoms from occurring in the first place and also in preparing the patient, the physician and the community in managing the outcomes effectively.","2022","2022 May","Durgamani Kishore Yellumahanthi; Bethany Barnett; Sarabeth Barnett; Shushruth Yellumahanthi","Family Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Huntsville, USA.; Family Medicine, Family Medicine of Huntsville, Huntsville, USA.; None, Ardmore High School, Ardmore, USA.; None, New Century Technology High School, Huntsville, USA."

However, the long-term neurological complications of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are not clear. The aim this study was to analyze a case report the presence of neurological sequelae due to post-Coronavirus disease 19 in a patient without apparent previous neurological symptoms. Clinical case: A 46-year-old patient, with no relevant history for the described condition, who, after severe COVID-19 infection, started a mixed neuropathy and mental fog syndrome as the main sequel. Multiple laboratory and imaging studies were performed during and after his hospital stay, and it was corroborated by an electromyography that it occurred from a neuropathy triggered by COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: This case provides additional evidence that mixed neuropathy and brain fog syndrome are potential complications of post-coronavirus disease 2019 syndrome. The neurological sequelae that manifest after a COVID-19 episode can be rapidly enhanced as a consequence of another alteration in some systems of the organism. However, future studies are necessary to elucidate the incidence of these neurological complications, their pathophysiological mechanisms and their therapeutic options.","2022","2022 Apr 25","Donají Suárez-Sánchez; Nereida Violeta Vega-Cabrera; Monserrat Fernández-Moya; Maribel Mendoza-Navarro; Ángel Bahena-Hernández; Jesús Fabian Rojas-Hernández; Librado Baños-Peña; Francisco Vladimir López-Méndez; Osmar Antonio Jaramillo-Morales","Department of Medical Education and Research, Mexican Social Security Institute, Family Medicine Unit 46, Coyoacan, Mexico City 04610, Mexico.; Department of Medical Education and Research, Mexican Social Security Institute, Family Medicine Unit 46, Coyoacan, Mexico City 04610, Mexico.; Life Sciences Division, Nursing and Obstetrics Department, Campus Irapuato-Salamanca, University of Guanajuato, Ex Hacienda el Copal, km. 9 Carretera Irapuato- Silao, A.P. 311, Irapuato, Guanajuato 36500, Mexico.; Department of Medical Education and Research, Mexican Social Security Institute, Family Medicine Unit 46, Coyoacan, Mexico City 04610, Mexico.; Department of Medical Education and Research, Mexican Social Security Institute, Family Medicine Unit 46, Coyoacan, Mexico City 04610, Mexico.; Department of Medical Education and Research, Mexican Social Security Institute, Family Medicine Unit 46, Coyoacan, Mexico City 04610, Mexico.; Department of Medical Education and Research, Mexican Social Security Institute, Family Medicine Unit 46, Coyoacan, Mexico City 04610, Mexico.; Department of Medical Education and Research, Mexican Social Security Institute, Family Medicine Unit 46, Coyoacan, Mexico City 04610, Mexico.; Life Sciences Division, Nursing and Obstetrics Department, Campus Irapuato-Salamanca, University of Guanajuato, Ex Hacienda el Copal, km. 9 Carretera Irapuato- Silao, A.P. 311, Irapuato, Guanajuato 36500, Mexico."

We analysed data from 207 eligible COVID-19 positive frontline workers who participated in a two-month post-COVID-19 online self-administered survey. The survey response rate was 30%; of the 62 respondents with a median age of 33.5 years (IQR= 30-44 years), 47 (76%) were females.

Neuroinflammation and disturbed redox homeostasis are suggested as prevailing underlying mechanisms in neurological sequelae propagation in long-COVID. We aimed to investigate whether variations in antioxidant genetic profile might be associated with neurological sequelae in long-COVID. Neurological examination and antioxidant genetic profile (SOD2, GPXs and GSTs) determination, as well as, genotype analysis of Nrf2 and ACE2, were conducted on 167 COVID-19 patients. Polymorphisms were determined by the appropriate PCR methods. Only polymorphisms in GSTP1AB and GSTO1 were independently associated with long-COVID manifestations. Indeed, individuals carrying GSTP1 Val or GSTO1 Asp allele exhibited lower odds of long-COVID myalgia development, both independently and in combination. Furthermore, the combined presence of GSTP1 Ile and GSTO1 Ala alleles exhibited cumulative risk regarding long-COVID myalgia in carriers of the combined GPX1 LeuLeu/GPX3 CC genotype. Moreover, individuals carrying combined GSTM1-null/GPX1LeuLeu genotype were more prone to developing long-COVID ""brain fog"", while this probability further enlarged if the Nrf2 A allele was also present. The fact that certain genetic variants of antioxidant enzymes, independently or in combination, affect the probability of long-COVID manifestations, further emphasizes the involvement of genetic susceptibility when SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated in the host cells, and also months after.","2022","2022 May 12","Marko Ercegovac; Milika Asanin; Ana Savic-Radojevic; Jovan Ranin; Marija Matic; Tatjana Djukic; Vesna Coric; Djurdja Jerotic; Nevena Todorovic; Ivana Milosevic; Goran Stevanovic; Tatjana Simic; Zoran Bukumiric; Marija Pljesa-Ercegovac","Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Clinic of Neurology, Clinical Centre of Serbia, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Clinic of Cardiology, Clinical Centre of Serbia, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Institute of Medical and Clinical Biochemistry, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Clinic of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Institute of Medical and Clinical Biochemistry, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Institute of Medical and Clinical Biochemistry, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Institute of Medical and Clinical Biochemistry, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Institute of Medical and Clinical Biochemistry, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Clinic of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Clinic of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Clinic of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Institute of Medical and Clinical Biochemistry, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Department of Medical Sciences, Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Institute of Medical Statistics and Informatics, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Institute of Medical and Clinical Biochemistry, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia."

Thus, the aim of our study is to estimate the prevalence, symptoms, and signs extending beyond the acute phase of Covid-19 compared to the general population not infected with the virus and to assess the factors influencing the occurrence of these symptoms in developing countries like Morocco. This study recruited 118 healthcare workers who endured the Covid-19 infection and 118 matched controls that had never experienced it. We have defined Long-Covid-19 according to guidance for NICE, and we used a survey made of direct questions and short answers sent to the recruiters via mail to evaluate the demographic parameters, severity and duration of the Covid-19 symptoms, vaccination against SARS CoV-2, and pulmonary involvement, and a series of general symptoms were looked for. Our study found that the prevalence of Long-Covid-19 was 47.4%. Compared to the general population, the symptoms with statistical significative results were predominated by asthenia, myalgia, and brain fog. The severity of the pulmonary involvement on chest CT scan was the only risk factor to their occurrence, whereas no effect of the vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2 was found. Comparing to the literature, this study showed that nearly half of the patients who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 will experience a variety of symptoms after the acute phase of this infection, and that it would be a real burden even in the youngest.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether ganglion cell layer thickness (GCLT) was different in recovered COVID-19 patients compared to controls in the subacute stage and to determine whether it correlated with COVID-19-related neurological symptoms or pneumonia. This study involved 40 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. All the participants underwent ophthalmological examination, spectral domain optical coherence tomography and neurological examination. The clinical and biochemical properties of the patients were noted and their correlations with GCLT were sought. The duration after COVID-19 infection was 113 ± 62 (mean ± SD) days. At this subacute stage, there was no significant difference between the GCLT measurements of the COVID-19 patients and the controls (14 ± 4.0 µm [median ± IQR] vs 16 ± 4.8 µm, respectively). When we analyzed the relationships with neurological symptoms in the patient group, we found that patients with cognitive symptoms had lower GCLT values compared to those without (13 ± 3 µm vs. 16 ± 4 µm, respectively; p = 0.002). Patients who suffered headache during the acute infection also had lower GCLT values compared to those without (14 ± 4 µm vs. 18 ± 5 µm, respectively; p = 0.015). The GCLT values did not differ significantly with respect to anosmia, ageusia, sleep disturbances, having had COVID-19 pneumonia, or smoking status.

The most dominant immune cells in the brain are microglia. Yet, the relationship between neurological manifestations, neuroinflammation, and host immune response of microglia to SARS-CoV-2 has not been well characterized. Here, we reported that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect human microglia, eliciting M1-like proinflammatory responses, followed by cytopathic effects. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 infected human microglial clone 3 (HMC3), leading to inflammatory activation and cell death. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis also revealed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and immune responses were induced in the early, and apoptotic processes in the late phases of viral infection. SARS-CoV-2-infected HMC3 showed the M1 phenotype and produced proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), but not the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. After this proinflammatory activation, SARS-CoV-2 infection promoted both intrinsic and extrinsic death receptor-mediated apoptosis in HMC3. Using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, murine microglia were also infected by intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. This infection induced the acute production of proinflammatory microglial IL-6 and TNF-α and provoked a chronic loss of microglia. Our findings suggest that microglia are potential mediators of SARS-CoV-2-induced neurological problems and, consequently, can be targets of therapeutic strategies against neurological diseases in patients with COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Recent studies reported neurological and cognitive sequelae in patients with COVID-19 months after the viral infection with several symptoms, including ageusia, anosmia, asthenia, headache, and brain fog. Our conclusions raise awareness of COVID-19-related microglia-mediated neurological disorders to develop treatment strategies for the affected patients. We also indicated that HMC3 was a novel human cell line susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection that exhibited cytopathic effects, which could be further used to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurological manifestations of patients with COVID-19.","2022","2022 Jun 29","Gi Uk Jeong; Jaemyun Lyu; Kyun-Do Kim; Young Cheul Chung; Gun Young Yoon; Sumin Lee; Insu Hwang; Won-Ho Shin; Junsu Ko; June-Yong Lee; Young-Chan Kwon","Center for Convergent Research for Emerging Virus Infection, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technologygrid.29869.3c, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.; Arontier Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Center for Convergent Research for Emerging Virus Infection, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technologygrid.29869.3c, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.; Department of Predictive Toxicology, Korea Institute of Toxicology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.; Center for Convergent Research for Emerging Virus Infection, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technologygrid.29869.3c, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.; Center for Convergent Research for Emerging Virus Infection, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technologygrid.29869.3c, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.; Center for Convergent Research for Emerging Virus Infection, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technologygrid.29869.3c, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.; Department of Predictive Toxicology, Korea Institute of Toxicology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.; Arontier Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Yonsei Universitygrid.15444.30, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Institute for Immunology and Immunological Disease, Brain Korea 21 Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.; Center for Convergent Research for Emerging Virus Infection, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technologygrid.29869.3c, Daejeon, Republic of Korea."

An interdisciplinary team can achieve goal-oriented and patient-centered rehabilitation, which can optimize function and QOL, and minimize impairments, restrictions, and activity limitations. In most cases, cancer patients must be active participants in therapy and exhibit carryover. Patients with cancer often have impairments that include fatigue, pain, brain fog, impaired cognition, paresis, mood disorders, difficulty with activities of daily living (ADL), bowel/bladder/sexual dysfunction, and bone and soft tissue involvement. Adaptive equipment, exercise, and ADL training can mitigate restrictions on activity. The trajectory and phase of the disease along the continuum of cancer care may influence the goals of rehabilitation in that time window. QOL is often influenced by participation in vocational, recreational, and home-based activities.

Understanding patient-valued treatment outcomes may facilitate future study design. The aim of this work was to identify patient-valued outcome measures for headache preventive treatments among adolescents with continuous headache due to chronic migraine and their parents. Adolescents with an International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition diagnosis of chronic migraine, who had continuous headache and who were being cared for at a tertiary pediatric headache clinic, and their parents were surveyed to query the value of treatment outcomes in the domains of headache frequency, intensity, functional impact, and associated symptoms. Individual outcomes and categories of outcomes were ranked in order of preference using weighted average rank. Results were rounded to the degree of precision with which they were measured. The survey was completed by 55 adolescents and 60 parents of adolescents with continuous headache due to chronic migraine. Mean age of adolescents was 16 (SD 1, range 12-17) years. Median adolescent-reported duration of continuous headache was 24 (interquartile range [IQR] 12-39) months, and adolescents had tried a median of 2 (IQR 0-5) preventive medications, only 13% of which were perceived as helpful. Overall, the most valued individual outcome measure among both adolescents and parents was a decrease in frequency of more severe headaches; however, outcomes reflecting headache intensity were most valued by adolescents, while outcomes reflecting functional impact were most valued by parents. More than 60% of adolescents felt that it was more important to measure decrease in frequency and intensity of headaches in terms of severe headaches/spikes rather than total headache days. Among associated symptoms, improvement in brain fog was most highly valued by both adolescents and parents. The results of this study provide important information about which preventive treatment outcomes are valued by adolescents with continuous headache due to chronic migraine and their parents. Results suggest that adolescents value a decrease in frequency of severe headaches over a decrease in frequency of headache days overall. Generalizability may be limited because the surveyed population was being cared for at a tertiary pediatric headache clinic and generally had headache disorders that were refractory to treatment. These results may help guide future trial design in this population with continuous headache due to chronic migraine.","2022","2022 Jun 07","Cynthia Morris; Alexandra Ross; Kaitlin Greene; Samantha Irwin; Amanda Wagstaff; Amy Gelfand","From the Division of Child Neurology (C.M.), Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, Saint Louis University, MO; Child & Adolescent Headache Program (A.R., S.I., A.W., A.G.), University of California, San Francisco, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital; and Doernbecher Children's Hospital Child and Adolescent Headache Program (K.G.), Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland. cynthia.j.morris@health.slu.edu.; From the Division of Child Neurology (C.M.), Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, Saint Louis University, MO; Child & Adolescent Headache Program (A.R., S.I., A.W., A.G.), University of California, San Francisco, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital; and Doernbecher Children's Hospital Child and Adolescent Headache Program (K.G.), Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland.; From the Division of Child Neurology (C.M.), Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, Saint Louis University, MO; Child & Adolescent Headache Program (A.R., S.I., A.W., A.G.), University of California, San Francisco, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital; and Doernbecher Children's Hospital Child and Adolescent Headache Program (K.G.), Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland.; From the Division of Child Neurology (C.M.), Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, Saint Louis University, MO; Child & Adolescent Headache Program (A.R., S.I., A.W., A.G.), University of California, San Francisco, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital; and Doernbecher Children's Hospital Child and Adolescent Headache Program (K.G.), Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland.; From the Division of Child Neurology (C.M.), Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, Saint Louis University, MO; Child & Adolescent Headache Program (A.R., S.I., A.W., A.G.), University of California, San Francisco, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital; and Doernbecher Children's Hospital Child and Adolescent Headache Program (K.G.), Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland.; From the Division of Child Neurology (C.M.), Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, Saint Louis University, MO; Child & Adolescent Headache Program (A.R., S.I., A.W., A.G.), University of California, San Francisco, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital; and Doernbecher Children's Hospital Child and Adolescent Headache Program (K.G.), Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland."

In some cases of COVID-19, patients can be characterized by clinical sequelae with mild-to-moderate symptoms that persist long after the resolution of the acute infection, known as long-COVID, potentially affecting their quality of life. The main symptoms of long-COVID include persistent dyspnea, fatigue and weakness (that are typically out of proportion, to the degree of ongoing lung damage and gas exchange impairment), persistence of anosmia and dysgeusia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cognitive dysfunctions (such as brain fog or memory lapses). The appropriate management and prevention of potential long-COVID sequelae is still lacking. It is also believed that long-term symptoms of COVID-19 are related to an immunity over-response, namely a cytokine storm, involving the release of pro-inflammatory interleukins, monocyte chemoattractant proteins, and tissue necrosis factors. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) shows affinity for vanilloid receptor 1 and for cannabinoid-like G protein-coupled receptors, enhancing anandamide activity by means of an entourage effect. Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, PEA has been recently used as an early add-on therapy for respiratory problems in patients with COVID-19. It is believed that PEA mitigates the cytokine storm modulating cell-mediated immunity, as well as counteracts pain and oxidative stress. In this article, we theorize that PEA could be a potentially effective nutraceutical to treat long-COVID, with regard to fatigue and myalgia, where a mythocondrial dysfunction is hypothesizable.","2022","2022 Jan-Mar","Loredana Raciti; Francesca Antonia Arcadi; Rocco Salvatore Calabrò","Drs.

An emerging feature of severe COVID-19 is that of temporary and extended neurocognitive impairment, exhibiting a myriad of symptoms and signs. The causes of this symptomatology have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we aim to investigate patients treated for severe COVID-19 in the ICU, as to describe and relate serum-, plasma- and cerebrospinal fluid-borne molecular and cellular biomarkers of immune activity, coagulopathy, cerebral damage, neuronal inflammation, and degeneration, to the temporal development of structural and functional changes within the brain as evident by serial MRI and extensive cognitive assessments at 3-12 months after ICU discharge. To date, we have performed 51 3-month follow-up MRIs in the ICU survivors. Of these, two patients (~4%) have had incidental findings on brain MRI findings requiring activation of the Incidental Findings Management Plan. Furthermore, the neuropsychological and neurological examinations have so far revealed varying and mixed patterns. Several patients expressed cognitive and/or mental concerns and fatigue, complaints closely related to brain fog.

Of the 31 subjects, 65% reported subjective dyscognition and 39% had objective dyscognition, primarily in the domains of psychomotor speed (23%), executive function (23%), and attention (3%). Subjective dyscognition was not indicative of objective dyscognition. Subjective dyscognition was independently associated with functional disability (OR: 1.19 [95% CI: 1.02-1.40]) and anxiety (OR: 1.12 [95% CI: 1.02-1.24]). Adolescents with fibromyalgia predominantly experience subjective dyscognition but more than 1/3 also experience objective dyscognition. Future research should explore the impact of interdisciplinary rehabilitation programs on the treatment of dyscognition in youth with JFMS.","2022","2022","Sabrina Gmuca; Maitry Sonagra; Rui Xiao; Elizabeth Mendoza; Kimberly S Miller; Nina H Thomas; Jami F Young; Pamela F Weiss; David D Sherry; Jeffrey S Gerber","Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; PolicyLab, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; PolicyLab, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.; Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine at University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Milken Institute School of Public Health, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Center for Human Phenomic Science Behavioral Neuroscience Core, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Behavioral Services, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; PolicyLab, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Behavioral Services, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States."

Little is known about how older survivors have experienced the consequences and how these have affected their lives. The aim of this study was to explore how older survivors experienced post-COVID-19 condition and life changes approximately 6 months after hospitalisation for COVID-19. The study had an explorative and descriptive design. Semi-structured interviews were performed with 17 participants from two local hospitals, 11 men and 6 women, aged 60 years and older (age range 60-96), approximately 6 months after hospitalisation for COVID-19. A thematic descriptive analysis inspired by Braun and Clarke was used. Two main themes and seven subthemes were revealed. The main themes were: From few to various persistent symptoms and Existential thoughts and reflections. Most of the participants experienced various physical and/or cognitive symptoms, such as reduced physical fitness, heavy breathing, fatigue, and 'brain fog'. On the other hand, they also experienced guilt and gratitude for having survived. The recognition of having achieved other life perspectives was also present. Six months after undergone COVID-19 the participants still experienced various distressing symptoms, which were in line with larger studies. The novel findings of this study were connected to the existential area, where the patients' thoughts and reflections of guilt, gratitude, and new life perspectives were revealed. These findings are important for health professionals to consider when treating patients after COVID-19.","2022","2022 Jun","Kristi E Heiberg; Anne K T Heggestad; Nina Jøranson; Hilde Lausund; Grete Breievne; Marius Myrstad; Anette H Ranhoff; Marte M Walle-Hansen; Vigdis Bruun-Olsen","Faculty of Health Science, Oslo Metropolitan University, Oslo, Norway. kriseh@oslomet.no.; Department of Medical Research, Bærum Hospital Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Drammen, Norway. kriseh@oslomet.no.; Faculty of Health Studies, VID Specialized University, Oslo, Norway.; Faculty of Health Studies, VID Specialized University, Oslo, Norway.; Faculty of Health Studies, VID Specialized University, Oslo, Norway.; Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, University of South-Eastern Norway, Drammen, Norway.; Department of Medical Research, Bærum Hospital Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Drammen, Norway.; Diakonhjemmet Hospital Trust, Oslo, Norway.; University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Medical Research, Bærum Hospital Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Drammen, Norway.; Department of Medical Research, Bærum Hospital Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Drammen, Norway."

We followed more than 70,000 adult participants in an ongoing cohort study, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Infected and non-infected participants registered presence of 22 different symptoms in March 2021. One year after infection, 13 of 22 symptoms were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on relative risks between infected and uninfected subjects. For instance, 17.4% of SARS-CoV-2 infected cohort participants reported fatigue that persist 12 months after infection, compared to new occurrence of fatigue that had lasted less than 12 months in 3.8% of non-infected subjects (excess risk 13.6%). The adjusted relative risk for fatigue was 4.8 (95% CI 3.5-6.7). Two main underlying factors explained 50% of the variance in the 13 symptoms. Brain fog, poor memory, dizziness, heart palpitations, and fatigue had high loadings on the first factor, while shortness-of breath and cough had high loadings on the second factor. Lack of taste and smell showed low to moderate correlation to other symptoms. Anxiety, depression and mood swings were not strongly related to COVID-19.

A Cross-Sectional Study.","Brain sciences","","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; brain fog; cognitive deficit; headache; mental clouding; neuroinflammation; olfaction; olfactory dysfunction; smell","Smell alteration and cognitive impairment are common features of the Long-COVID Syndrome. Mental clouding, often described as brain fog, might affect smell by altering recollection of odors or through a share mechanism of neuroinflammation. We investigated mental clouding, headache, and cognitive function in adult patients with persistent COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction. This multi-center cross-sectional study enrolled 152 adults with self-reported olfactory dysfunction from 3 tertiary centers specialized in COVID-19 olfactory disorders. Inclusion criteria were smell alterations after COVID-19 persisting over 6 months from infection, age >18 and < 65. Exclusion criteria included smell alterations, headache, or memory problems prior to COVID-19 infection. The patients were evaluated by olfactometry, nasal endoscopy, headache scale, cognitive assessment, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and self-reported measures. Smell dysfunction was stratified and classified based on olfactory deficit severity and presence of olfactory distortion (parosmia, cacosmia). Data on smell disorder, mental clouding, MMSE, and headache were analyzed to assess correlations. Among the 152 patients studied, 50 (32.8%) presented with anosmia, 25 (16.4%) with hyposmia, 10 (6.6%) with parosmia/cacosmia, and 58 patients (38.2%) with a combination of hyposmia and parosmia; seven (4.6%) patients suffered from headache exclusively, and two (1.4%) had headache and mental clouding as their primary symptom. Headache was reported by 76 (50%) patients, and mental clouding by 71 (46.7%). The patients reporting headache, mental clouding, or both, had significantly increased risk of suffering from anosmia and/or hyposmia when compared with their counterparts without these neurological symptoms. No patients had reduced MMSE scores. In our cohort of adult patients with post-COVID-19, smell alterations persisting over 6 months, cognitive impairment and headache were associated with more severe olfactory loss, consistent with neuroinflammatory mechanisms mediating a variety of Long-COVID symptoms.","2022","2022 Jan 24","Arianna Di Stadio; Michael J Brenner; Pietro De Luca; Maria Albanese; Luca D'Ascanio; Massimo Ralli; Dalila Roccamatisi; Cristina Cingolani; Federica Vitelli; Angelo Camaioni; Stefano Di Girolamo; Evanthia Bernitsas","Department GF Ingrassia, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.; Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, USA.; Department of Medicine, Surgery and Dentistry, University of Salerno, 84125 Salerno, Italy.; Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00133 Rome, Italy.; Department of Otolaryngology, AORMN, 61032 Fano, Italy.; Organ of Sense Department, University La Sapienza, 00185 Rome, Italy.; Psychology Department, UTIU, 00133 Rome, Italy.; Department of Otolaryngology, AORMN, 61032 Fano, Italy.; Department of Otolaryngology, AORMN, 61032 Fano, Italy.; Otolaryngology Department, San Giovanni Addolorata Hospital, 00133 Rome, Italy.; Unit of Otorhinolaryngology, Department of Clinical Sciences and Translation Medicine, Tor Vergata University, 00133 Rome, Italy.; Multiple Sclerosis Center, Neurology Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, USA."

The Comprehensive Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (CPEQ) assessed activity interference (actions performed in daily life that are hindered) in 149 UK pSS patients. This was modified to include four additional symptoms (fatigue, mood, dryness and brainfog/mental fatigue). Functional impairment was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Improved Health Assessment Questionnaire (Improved HAQ). Univariable linear regression models were estimated to investigate the association between CPEQ results and the outcome scores obtained from the HADS and Improved HAQ. Multivariable linear regression models were estimated adjusting for patient age and length of disease. Fatigue had the biggest impact on seven activity domains: physical exercise (mean score of 3.49 out of 5 [s.d. 1.26]), performing household chores (mean 3.14 [s.d. 1.18]), gardening or shopping (mean 3.18 [s.d. 1.20]), socializing with others (mean 2.62 [s.d. 1.24]), recreation/hobbies (mean 2.88 [s.d. 1.20]), sexual relations (mean 3.00 [s.d. 1.52]), and mental efficacy (mean 2.69 [s.d. 1.17]). Regression analysis showed a positive correlation in which every point increase in an activity interference category saw the overall mood and physical functioning scores increase.

However, a global increase in the prevalence of fatigue, brain fog, depression and other ""sickness behavior""-like symptoms implicates a possible dysregulation in neuroimmune mechanisms even among those never infected by the virus. We compared fifty-seven 'Pre-Pandemic' and fifteen 'Pandemic' datasets from individuals originally enrolled as control subjects for various completed, or ongoing, research studies available in our records, with a confirmed negative test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We used a combination of multimodal molecular brain imaging (simultaneous positron emission tomography / magnetic resonance spectroscopy), behavioral measurements, imaging transcriptomics and serum testing to uncover links between pandemic-related stressors and neuroinflammation. Healthy individuals examined after the enforcement of 2020 lockdown/stay-at-home measures demonstrated elevated brain levels of two independent neuroinflammatory markers (the 18 kDa translocator protein, TSPO, and myoinositol) compared to pre-lockdown subjects. The serum levels of two inflammatory markers (interleukin-16 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) were also elevated, although these effects did not reach statistical significance after correcting for multiple comparisons. Subjects endorsing higher symptom burden showed higher TSPO signal in the hippocampus (mood alteration, mental fatigue), intraparietal sulcus and precuneus (physical fatigue), compared to those reporting little/no symptoms. Post-lockdown TSPO signal changes were spatially aligned with the constitutive expression of several genes involved in immune/neuroimmune functions. This work implicates neuroimmune activation as a possible mechanism underlying the non-virally-mediated symptoms experienced by many during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies will be needed to corroborate and further interpret these preliminary findings.","2022","2022 May","Ludovica Brusaferri; Zeynab Alshelh; Daniel Martins; Minhae Kim; Akila Weerasekera; Hope Housman; Erin J Morrissey; Paulina C Knight; Kelly A Castro-Blanco; Daniel S Albrecht; Chieh-En Tseng; Nicole R Zürcher; Eva-Maria Ratai; Oluwaseun Akeju; Meena M Makary; Ciprian Catana; Nathaniel D Mercaldo; Nouchine Hadjikhani; Mattia Veronese; Federico Turkheimer; Bruce R Rosen; Jacob M Hooker; Marco L Loggia","Athinoula A.

In remotely held focus groups, participants were invited to describe their neurocognitive symptoms and comment on others' accounts. Individuals were followed up by email 4-6 months later. Data were audiotaped, transcribed, anonymised and coded in NVIVO. They were analysed by an interdisciplinary team with expertise in general practice, clinical neuroscience, the sociology of chronic illness and service delivery, and checked by people with lived experience of brain fog. Of the 50 participants, 42 were female and 32 white British. Most had never been hospitalised for COVID-19. Qualitative analysis revealed the following themes: mixed views on the appropriateness of the term 'brain fog'; rich descriptions of the experience of neurocognitive symptoms (especially executive function, attention, memory and language), accounts of how the illness fluctuated-and progressed over time; the profound psychosocial impact of the condition on relationships, personal and professional identity; self-perceptions of guilt, shame and stigma; strategies used for self-management; challenges accessing and navigating the healthcare system; and participants' search for physical mechanisms to explain their symptoms. These qualitative findings complement research into the epidemiology and mechanisms of neurocognitive symptoms after COVID-19.

This observational study investigated cognitive functioning among individuals with persistent cognitive complaints about 5.5 months after COVID-19 infection. Patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 and persistent cognitive complaints underwent comprehensive in-person neuropsychological evaluations. Patients with prior neurological disorders were excluded. When diagnosed, 40% required hospitalization, 15% were in an intensive care unit, 10% needed mechanical ventilation, and 10% experienced delirium. This sample was predominately women (90%), White non-Hispanic (70%), with average education of 15 years. Mild cognitive deficits were seen on tests involving attention and processing speed or executive function. Seventy percent of patients were diagnosed with a mood disorder prior to COVID-19 infection. At the time of testing, 35%-40% endorsed moderate to severe mood symptoms and 85% noted significant fatigue as measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale. The pattern of cognitive deficits, although mild, is consistent with prior research at the acute stage of the illness. These findings suggest that psychological factors and other persisting symptoms (e.g., sleep, fatigue) may play a significant role in subjective cognitive complaints in patients with persisting complaints post COVID-19 who did not require intensive treatment. These patients would likely benefit from resources to manage persisting or new mood symptoms and compensatory strategies for the cognitive inefficiencies they experience.","2022","2022 May 16","Kamini Krishnan; Ashley K Miller; Katherine Reiter; Aaron Bonner-Jackson","Department of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Department of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Department of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Department of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA."

This study aims to explore whether digitally enabled, remotely supported rehabilitation for people with long COVID-19 can enable healthcare systems to provide high quality care to large numbers of patients within the available resources. Specific objectives are to (1) develop and refine a digital health intervention (DHI) that supports patient assessment, monitoring and remote rehabilitation; (2) develop implementation models that support sustainable deployment at scale; (3) evaluate the impact of the DHI on recovery trajectories and (4) identify and mitigate health inequalities due to the digital divide. Mixed-methods, theoretically informed, single-arm prospective study, combining methods drawn from engineering/computer science with those from biomedicine. There are four work packages (WP), one for each objective. WP1 focuses on identifying user requirements and iteratively developing the intervention to meet them; WP2 combines qualitative data from users with learning from implementation science and normalisation process theory, to promote adoption, scale-up, spread and sustainability of the intervention; WP3 uses quantitative demographic, clinical and resource use data collected by the DHI to determine illness trajectories and how these are affected by use of the DHI; while WP4 focuses on identifying and mitigating health inequalities and overarches the other three WPs.

Here, we examined a wide range of cognitive functions critical for daily life (including sustained attention, memory, motor control, planning, semantic reasoning, mental rotation and spatial-visual attention) in people who had previously suffered from COVID-19 but were not significantly different from a control group on self-reported fatigue, forgetfulness, sleep abnormality, motivation, depression, anxiety and personality profile. Reassuringly, COVID-19 survivors performed well in most abilities tested, including working memory, executive function, planning and mental rotation. However, they displayed significantly worse episodic memory (up to 6 months post-infection) and greater decline in vigilance with time on task (for up to 9 months). Overall, the results show that specific chronic cognitive changes following COVID-19 are evident on objective testing even amongst those who do not report a greater symptom burden. Importantly, in the sample tested here, these were not significantly different from normal after 6-9 months, demonstrating evidence of recovery over time.","2022","2022","Sijia Zhao; Kengo Shibata; Peter J Hellyer; William Trender; Sanjay Manohar; Adam Hampshire; Masud Husain","Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3PH, UK.; Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.; Department of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, 926, Sir Michael Uren Hub, 86 Wood Lane, London W12 0BZ, UK.; Department of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, 926, Sir Michael Uren Hub, 86 Wood Lane, London W12 0BZ, UK.; Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3PH, UK.; Department of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, 926, Sir Michael Uren Hub, 86 Wood Lane, London W12 0BZ, UK.; Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3PH, UK."

The supplementation with probiotic (OB) would have a positive effect on metabolic homeostasis, negatively impacting the occurrence of symptoms related to the CNS after hospital discharge. On a total of 58 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 24 (41.4%) received OB during hospitalization (OB+) while 34 (58.6%) taken only the standard treatment (OB-). Serum metabolomic profiling of patients has been performed at both hospital acceptance (T0) and discharge (T1). Six months after discharge, fatigue perceived by participants was assessed by administrating the Fatigue Assessment Scale. 70.7% of participants reported fatigue while 29.3% were negative for such condition. The OB+ group showed a significantly lower proportion of subjects reporting fatigue than the OB- one (p < 0.01). Furthermore, OB+ subjects were characterized by significantly increased concentrations of serum Arginine, Asparagine, Lactate opposite to lower levels of 3-Hydroxyisobutirate than those not treated with probiotics. Our results strongly suggest that in COVID-19, the administration of probiotics during hospitalization may prevent the development of chronic fatigue by impacting key metabolites involved in the utilization of glucose as well as in energy pathways.","2021","2021","Letizia Santinelli; Luca Laghi; Giuseppe Pietro Innocenti; Claudia Pinacchio; Paolo Vassalini; Luigi Celani; Alessandro Lazzaro; Cristian Borrazzo; Massimiliano Marazzato; Lorenzo Tarsitani; Alexia E Koukopoulos; Claudio M Mastroianni; Gabriella d'Ettorre; Giancarlo Ceccarelli","Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.; Interdepartmental Centre for Agri-Food Industrial Research, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Human Neurosciences, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Human Neurosciences, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."

Many studies have been conducted to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and recently postinfection sequelae of this disease have begun to be investigated. However, there is little consensus on the longitudinal changes of lasting physical or psychological symptoms from prior COVID-19 infection. This study aims to investigate and analyze public social media data from Reddit to understand the longitudinal impact of COVID-19 symptoms before and after recovery from COVID-19. We collected 22,890 Reddit posts that were generated by 14,401 authors from March 14 to December 16, 2020. Using active learning and intensive manual inspection, 292 (2.03%) active authors, who were infected by COVID-19 and frequently reported disease progress on Reddit, along with their 2213 (9.67%) longitudinal posts, were identified. Machine learning tools to extract biomedical information were applied to identify COVID-19 symptoms mentioned in the Reddit posts. We then examined longitudinal changes in individual physiological and psychological characteristics before and after recovery from COVID-19 infection. In total, 58 physiological and 3 psychological symptoms were identified in social media before and after recovery from COVID-19 infection. From the analyses, we found that symptoms of patients with COVID-19 lasted 2.5 months. On average, symptoms appeared around a month before recovery and remained for 1.5 months after recovery. Well-known COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, cough, and chest congestion, appeared relatively earlier in patient journeys and were frequently observed before recovery from COVID-19. Meanwhile, mental discomfort or distress, such as brain fog or stress, fatigue, and manifestations on toes or fingers, were frequently mentioned after recovery and remained as intermediate- and longer-term sequelae. In this study, we showed the dynamic changes in COVID-19 symptoms during the infection and recovery phases of the disease. Our findings suggest the feasibility of using social media data for investigating disease states and understanding the evolution of the physiological and psychological characteristics of COVID-19 infection over time.","2022","2022 Feb 16","Sarah Sarabadani; Gaurav Baruah; Yan Fossat; Jouhyun Jeon","Applied Sciences, Klick Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Applied Sciences, Klick Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Applied Sciences, Klick Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Applied Sciences, Klick Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada."

Myalgia has been recognized as a symptom of long COVID syndrome. The treatment for long COVID syndrome-related myalgia lacks research. Dry needling is a technique that involves the insertion of a needle into the tissue of, or overlaying, a pain point. Wet needling is the addition of an injection of an analgesic substance such as lidocaine while performing needling. Both dry and wet needling have are practiced as treatment modalities for myofascial pain. Limited literature exists to define long COVID syndrome-related myalgia and its relation to myofascial pain, or to examine the utility of needling techniques for this pain. We report a case of dry and wet needling as effective treatments for long COVID-related myofascial pain. A 59-year-old, previously healthy Hispanic male with no comorbid conditions was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient suffered moderate disease without hypoxia and was never hospitalized. Three months later, the patient continued to suffer from symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, ""brain fog,"" and myalgia. An extensive multisystem workup revealed normal cardiac, pulmonary, and end organ functions. The patient was then diagnosed with long COVID syndrome. The nature and chronicity of the patient's myalgia meet the criteria for myofascial pain. Both wet and dry needling were used to treat the patient's myofascial pain, with good short- and long-term therapeutic effects. COVID-19 infection has been shown to exacerbate preexisting myofascial pain syndrome. Our case report indicates that long COVID syndrome-related myalgia is likely a form of new-onset myofascial pain. Additionally, both wet and dry needling can be utilized as an effective treatment modality for this pain syndrome, with short- and long-term benefits.","2022","2022 Jan 17","Mengyi Zha; Kristina Chaffee; Jude Alsarraj","Columbia Basin Health Association, 1515 E Columbia St, Othello, WA, 99344, USA. mengyiz@cbha.org.; Targeted Rural Underserved Track, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. mengyiz@cbha.org.; Targeted Rural Underserved Track, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.; University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.; Columbia Basin Health Association, 1515 E Columbia St, Othello, WA, 99344, USA."

Demographic and SDOH variables (age, race/ethnicity, education, employment, health insurance status, median income, primary language, living arrangements, and pre-COVID disability) were compared between patients with normal versus abnormal telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessments (t-MOCA; scores<18/22). Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate predictors of t-MoCA. Of 382 patients available for 6-month follow-up, 215 (56%) completed the t-MoCA (n = 109/215 [51%] had normal and n = 106/215 [49%] abnormal results). 14/215 (7%) patients had a prior history of dementia/cognitive impairment. Significant univariate predictors of abnormal t-MoCA included older age, ≤12 years of education, unemployment pre-COVID, Black race, and a pre-COVID history of cognitive impairment (all p < 0.05). In multivariable analyses, education ≤12 years (adjusted OR 5.21, 95%CI 2.25-12.09), Black race (aOR 5.54, 95%CI 2.25-13.66), and the interaction of baseline functional status and unemployment prior to hospitalization (aOR 3.98, 95%CI 1.23-12.92) were significantly associated with abnormal t-MoCA scores after adjusting for age, history of dementia, language, neurological complications, income and discharge disposition. Fewer years of education, Black race and unemployment with baseline disability were associated with abnormal t-MoCA scores 6-months post-hospitalization for COVID-19. These associations may be due to undiagnosed baseline cognitive dysfunction, implicit biases of the t-MoCA, other unmeasured SDOH or biological effects of SARS-CoV-2.","2022","2022 Jul 15","Eduard Valdes; Benjamin Fuchs; Chris Morrison; Leigh Charvet; Ariane Lewis; Sujata Thawani; Laura Balcer; Steven L Galetta; Thomas Wisniewski; Jennifer A Frontera","Department of Neurology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Neurology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Neurology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Neurology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Neurology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Neurology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Neurology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Neurology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Neurology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Neurology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.

Prevalence of CI is increasing worldwide. Those affected typically report symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, 'brain fog', and gastrointestinal problems - common primary care complaints. Substantial evidence suggests that improving IAQ may be helpful in reducing symptoms associated with CI. Primary care clinic patients were invited to participate in a series of structured environmental house calls (EHCs). To qualify, participants were assessed for CI with the Quick Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory. Those with CI volunteered to allow the EHC team to visit their homes to collect air samples for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Initial and post-intervention IAQ sampling was analyzed by an independent lab to determine VOC levels (ng/L). The team discussed indoor air exposures, their health effects, and provided guidance for reducing exposures. Homes where recommendations were followed showed the greatest improvements in IAQ. The improvements were based upon decreased airborne VOCs associated with reduced use of cleaning chemicals, personal care products, and fragrances, and reduction in the index patients' symptoms. Symptom improvement generally was not reported among those whose homes showed no VOC improvement. Improvements in both IAQ and patients' symptoms occur when families implement an action plan developed and shared with them by a trained EHC team. Indoor air problems simply are not part of most doctors' differential diagnoses, despite relatively high prevalence rates of CI in primary care clinics. Our three-question screening questionnaire - the BREESI - can help physicians identify which patients should complete the QEESI. After identifying patients with CI, the practitioner can help by counseling them regarding their home exposures to VOCs. The future of clinical medicine could include environmental house calls as standard of practice for susceptible patients.","2022","2022 Jan 12","Roger B Perales; Raymond F Palmer; Rudy Rincon; Jacqueline N Viramontes; Tatjana Walker; Carlos R Jaén; Claudia S Miller","Department of Family and Community Medicine, Hoffman TILT Program, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, Hoffman TILT Program, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, Hoffman TILT Program, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, Hoffman TILT Program, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, Hoffman TILT Program, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, Hoffman TILT Program, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, Hoffman TILT Program, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, USA."

This retrospective study evaluated consecutive patients with chronic fatigue, brain fog, and orthostatic intolerance consistent with PASC. Controls included patients with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and healthy participants. Analyzed data included surveys and autonomic (Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, sudomotor, and tilt tests), cerebrovascular (cerebral blood flow velocity [CBFv] monitoring in middle cerebral artery), respiratory (capnography monitoring), and neuropathic (skin biopsies for assessment of small fiber neuropathy) testing and inflammatory/autoimmune markers. Nine patients with PASC were evaluated 0.8 ± 0.3 years after a mild COVID-19 infection, and were treated as home observations. Autonomic, pain, brain fog, fatigue, and dyspnea surveys were abnormal in PASC and POTS (n = 10), compared with controls (n = 15). Tilt table test reproduced the majority of PASC symptoms. Orthostatic CBFv declined in PASC (-20.0 ± 13.4%) and POTS (-20.3 ± 15.1%), compared with controls (-3.0 ± 7.5%, p = 0.001) and was independent of end-tidal carbon dioxide in PASC, but caused by hyperventilation in POTS. Reduced orthostatic CBFv in PASC included both subjects without (n = 6) and with (n = 3) orthostatic tachycardia. Dysautonomia was frequent (100% in both PASC and POTS) but was milder in PASC (p = 0.002).

Although the majority of infected patients survive, and the rapid advent and deployment of vaccines have afforded increased immunity against SARS-CoV-2, long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have become increasingly recognized. These include, but are not limited to, chronic pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disorders, and proinflammatory-associated neurological dysfunction that may lead to psychological and neurocognitive impairment. A major component of cognitive dysfunction is operationally categorized as ""brain fog"" which comprises difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, confusion, depression, and fatigue. Multiple parameters associated with long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been detailed in clinical studies. Empirically elucidated mechanisms associated with the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 are by nature complex, but broad-based working models have focused on mitochondrial dysregulation, leading to systemic reductions of metabolic activity and cellular bioenergetics within the CNS structures. Multiple factors underlying the expression of brain fog may facilitate future pathogenic insults, leading to repetitive cycles of viral and bacterial propagation. Interestingly, diverse neurocognitive sequelae associated with COVID-19 are not dissimilar from those observed in other historical pandemics, thereby providing a broad and integrative perspective on potential common mechanisms of CNS dysfunction subsequent to viral infection. Poor mental health status may be reciprocally linked to compromised immune processes and enhanced susceptibility to infection by diverse pathogens. By extrapolation, we contend that COVID-19 may potentiate the severity of neurological/neurocognitive deficits in patients afflicted by well-studied neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Accordingly, the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sustained neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 are pivotal health care directives and provide a compelling rationale for careful monitoring of infected patients, as early mitigation efforts may reduce short- and long-term complications.","2022","2022","George B Stefano; Pascal Büttiker; Simon Weissenberger; Radek Ptacek; Fuzhou Wang; Tobias Esch; Thomas V Bilfinger; Jiri Raboch; Richard M Kream","Center for Cognitive and Molecular Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.; Center for Cognitive and Molecular Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.; Center for Cognitive and Molecular Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.; Department of Psychology, University of New York in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.; Center for Cognitive and Molecular Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.; Group of Neuropharmacology and Neurophysiology, Division of Neuroscience, The Bonoi Academy of Science and Education, Chapel Hill, NC27510, USA.; Institute for Integrative Health Care and Health Promotion, Faculty of Health/School of Medicine, Witten/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany.; Department of Surgery, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY11794, USA.; Center for Cognitive and Molecular Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.; Center for Cognitive and Molecular Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic."

Cervical sympathetic chain activity can be blocked with local anesthetic, allowing the regional autonomic nervous system to ""reboot."" In this case series, we successfully treated two Long COVID patients using stellate ganglion block, implicating dysautonomia in the pathophysiology of Long COVID and suggesting a novel treatment.","2022","2022 Jan 15","Luke D Liu; Deborah L Duricka","Neuroversion Inc., Anchorage, AK, USA.

However, there is no evidence regarding the length of cognitive decline in these patients. This study aimed to assess whether COVID-19-related cognitive decline is a permanent deficit or if it improves over time. Cognitive performance was evaluated by means of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in COVID-19 survivors and noninfected individuals. All study participants had four cognitive evaluations, two of them before the pandemic and the other two, 6 and 18 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak infection in the village. Linear mixed effects models for longitudinal data were fitted to assess differences in cognitive performance across COVID-19 survivors and noninfected individuals. The study included 78 participants, 50 with history of mild COVID-19 and 28 without. There was a significant-likely age-related-decline in MoCA scores between the two prepandemic tests (β = -1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -2.14 to -0.92, p < 0.001), which did not differ across individuals who later developed COVID-19 when compared to noninfected individuals. Six months after infection, only COVID-19 survivors had a significant decline in MoCA scores (β = -1.37, 95% CI = -2.14 to -0.61, p < 0.001), which reversed after 1 additional year of follow-up (β = 0.66, 95% CI = -0.11 to 1.42, p = 0.092).

The neuroimmune mechanism(s) that produces SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammation has not been characterized. Proposed mechanisms include peripheral cytokine signaling to the brain and/or direct viral infection of the CNS. Here, we explore the novel hypothesis that a structural protein (S1) derived from SARS-CoV-2 functions as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to induce neuroinflammatory processes independent of viral infection. Prior evidence suggests that the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is inflammatory in vitro and signals through the pattern recognition receptor TLR4. Therefore, we examined whether the S1 subunit is sufficient to drive 1) a behavioral sickness response, 2) a neuroinflammatory response, 3) direct activation of microglia in vitro, and 4) activation of transgenic human TLR2 and TLR4 HEK293 cells. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intra-cisterna magna (ICM) with vehicle or S1. In-cage behavioral monitoring (8 h post-ICM) demonstrated that S1 reduced several behaviors, including total activity, self-grooming, and wall-rearing. S1 also increased social avoidance in the juvenile social exploration test (24 h post-ICM). S1 increased and/or modulated neuroimmune gene expression (Iba1, Cd11b, MhcIIα, Cd200r1, Gfap, Tlr2, Tlr4, Nlrp3, Il1b, Hmgb1) and protein levels (IFNγ, IL-1β, TNF, CXCL1, IL-2, IL-10), which varied across brain regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, and frontal cortex) and time (24 h and 7d) post-S1 treatment. Direct exposure of microglia to S1 resulted in increased gene expression (Il1b, Il6, Tnf, Nlrp3) and protein levels (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF, CXCL1, IL-10). S1 also activated TLR2 and TLR4 receptor signaling in HEK293 transgenic cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that structural proteins derived from SARS-CoV-2 might function independently as PAMPs to induce neuroinflammatory processes via pattern recognition receptor engagement.","2022","2022 Feb","Matthew G Frank; Kathy H Nguyen; Jayson B Ball; Shelby Hopkins; Tel Kelley; Michael V Baratta; Monika Fleshner; Steven F Maier","Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Center for Neuroscience, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO 80301, United States.

IBD patients frequently consume probiotics, whether sanctioned by a physician or not. However, probiotic consumption in itself has been shown to increase the incidence of brain fog. We aimed to study the association between brain fog in IBD patients with or without probiotic use. We conducted a cross-sectional study among patients visiting a busy IBD clinic. Patients aged >18 with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, without pre-existing psychiatric illness or current use of opioid medications were included. They were divided into 2 groups: those using probiotics and those who did not. Patients were given a questionnaire that included details about symptoms of brain fog. Groups were analyzed by chi-square test for differences in baseline demographics, and Mann Whitney U test to compare outcomes between groups. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Of the 66 patients included (mean age 44±2 years), 35 (53%) were female and 59 (89.4%) were Caucasian. Among these patients, 31.8% (n = 21) took probiotics as dietary supplements with the majority (67%, n = 14) taking probiotics for over a year. Overall, there was a trend for an association between probiotic use and brain fog in all patients (p = 0.080) but no statistical significance was attained. However, brain fog was significantly associated with probiotic use among Caucasian patients (p = 0.044). Furthermore, there was a statistically significant association between brain fog and male patients using probiotics (p = 0.004). Duration of probiotic use was also associated with brain fog (p = 0.038). Consumption of probiotics was independently associated with brain fog in men, as well as Caucasian patients with IBD respectively. Given the high prevalence of probiotic use in IBD patients, prospective studies are warranted to examine the causal relationship between probiotics and IBD-associated brain fog to guide prescription of probiotic supplements for IBD.","2021","2021 Dec 01","Apaar Dadlani; Khushboo Gala; Jayesh Rai; Shesh Rai; Gerald Dryden","University Of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, United States.; Mayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.; University Of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, United States.; University Of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, United States.; University Of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, United States."

The secondary aim was to identify predictors of long COVID syndrome by multivariable logistic regression analysis. This was a single-centre prospective cohort study conducted at San Paolo Hospital in Milan, Italy. We enrolled adult patients who were evaluated at the post-COVID outpatient service of our Infectious Diseases Unit between 15 April 2020 and 15 December 2020. Participants were individuals who had clinically recovered from COVID-19 and in whom virological clearance had occurred. Previous infection by SARS-CoV-2 was microbiologically documented by positivity using a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal swab. All enrolled patients underwent blood tests and a comprehensive medical examination at follow-up. Individuals were interviewed about resolved and persisting symptoms and were asked to fill in two questionnaires to allow assessment of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression symptoms (HADS) score and of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) score. A total of 377 patients were enrolled in the study. The median time from symtpom onset to virological clerance was 44 (37-53) days. A diagnosis of long COVID syndrome was made in 260/377 (69%) patients. The most common reported symptoms were fatigue (149/377, 39.5%), exertional dyspnoea (109/377, 28.9%), musculoskeletal pain (80/377, 21.2%) and ""brain fog"" (76/377, 20.2%). Anxiety symptoms were ascertained in 71/377 (18.8%) individuals, whereas 40/377 (10.6%) patients presented symptoms of depression.

A total of 156 patients completed the survey, at a median (range) time of 351 days (82-457 days) after COVID-19 infection. All patients were prevaccination. The most common persistent symptoms reported were fatigue (n = 128, 82%), brain fog (n = 105, 67%), and headache (n = 94, 60%). The most common triggers of symptom exacerbation were physical exertion (n = 134, 86%), stress (n = 107, 69%), and dehydration (n = 77, 49%). Increased levels of fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) and dyspnea (Medical Research Council) were reported, alongside reductions in levels of regularly completed physical activity. Ninety-eight patients (63%) scored for at least mild cognitive impairment (Neuro-Qol), and the domain of the EuroQol: 5 dimension, 5 level most impacted was Self-care, Anxiety/Depression and Usual Activities. Persistent symptoms associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome seem to impact physical and cognitive function, health-related quality of life, and participation in society. More research is needed to further clarify the relationship between COVID-19 infection and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome symptoms, the underlying mechanisms, and treatment options.","2022","2022 Jan 01","Laura Tabacof; Jenna Tosto-Mancuso; Jamie Wood; Mar Cortes; Amy Kontorovich; Dayna McCarthy; Dahlia Rizk; Gabriela Rozanski; Erica Breyman; Leila Nasr; Christopher Kellner; Joseph E Herrera; David Putrino","From the Abilities Research Center, Department of Rehabilitation and Human Performance, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York (LT, JT-M, JW, MC, DM, GR, EB, LN, JEH, DP); Zena and Michael A.

The most frequent symptoms are fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. We describe a patient suffering from Long COVID in whom adrenal involvement was highlighted. Methods: The patient described Long COVID symptoms that persist 3 months after the negativization of the molecular swab test. The main symptoms were weakness, brain fog, dizziness, and muscular and joint pain. All routine lab panels for inflammation, anemia, and thyroid and liver function were conducted. Moreover, salivary cortisol and DHEA-S determinations were used to compute the adrenal stress index (ASI). Results: All tests were negative, except the ASI that showed very low levels of free cortisol. The patient started hydrocortisone acetate supplementation. Conclusion: Long COVID symptoms could be explained by an adrenal involvement, due to a COVID-19 action on adrenal glands and by a iatrogenic side effect of high glucocorticoid therapy during the COVID-19 infection. Salivary cortisol determination is effective for establishing a correct recovery plan.","2021","2021 Oct 11","Ciro Salzano; Giovanna Saracino; Giuseppe Cardillo","Unit of Internal Medicine, San Giovanni Bosco Hospital, ASL-NA1, Via Filippo Maria Briganti, 255, 80144 Napoli, Italy.; Medylab-Advanced Biochemistry, Viale Martiri di Nassiriya, 14, 81030 Lusciano, Italy.; Medylab-Advanced Biochemistry, Viale Martiri di Nassiriya, 14, 81030 Lusciano, Italy."

Cognitive impairment, also referred to as brain fog, has been recognized in other medical conditions and as a side-effect of treatments; however, it has not been previously reported in individuals with PID. The phenomenon of brain fog is recognized in other autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, including lupus, multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, and has resulted from chemotherapy treatment for cancer. This research investigates the self-reported memory function of individuals with a diagnosis of PID. Respondents completed a survey which used reliable and valid questionnaires: Memory Functioning Questionnaire, Beck's Depression Inventory II, and Beck's Anxiety Inventory. Of the 292 completed surveys, 133 did not report any comorbid neurological diagnosis or incident of concussion (both of which could influence perceived memory function). When compared to normative scores, the respondents in this study were found to have significantly greater perceived memory impairment. The respondents had a significant higher score for anxiety and depression as compared to non-anxious and non-depressed normative values. This study finds that individuals with a diagnosis of PID have a greater degree of perceived memory impairment, or brain fog, in addition to greater levels of anxiety and depression. Individuals with a diagnosis of PID would benefit from prospective surveillance through a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to track cognitive status and implement corrective measures, should any decline be identified.","2020","2020 Dec","Kerri L Sowers; Christine A Gayda-Chelder; Mary Lou Galantino","Stockton University, 101 Vera King Farris Drive, Galloway, NJ, 08205, USA.; Stockton University, 101 Vera King Farris Drive, Galloway, NJ, 08205, USA.; Stockton University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.; 101 Vera King Farris Drive, Galloway, NJ, 08205, USA."

Data were collected through facilitated, patient focus-group sessions in the USA between May and June 2019. Participants were adults with confirmed MDD who reported a major depressive episode within the past 2 years, for which they had received pharmacologic treatment for ≥6 weeks. The semi-structured discussion focused on the key topics of bothersome symptoms of MDD, the impact of symptoms on quality of life, and the effects of antidepressant treatment. Interviews were audio-recorded; findings were summarized using a content-analysis approach. Five focus-group sessions were undertaken, involving a total of 29 patients (each attended one session; mean age, 43.4 years; 72.4% female). Mean time since confirmed diagnosis of MDD was 13.1 years. The most commonly prescribed antidepressants received were bupropion (41.4% of participants), escitalopram (34.5%), and sertraline (34.5%). The most frequently reported bothersome MDD symptoms were fatigue (mentioned by 58.6% of participants), lack of motivation/loss of interest (51.7%), anxiety/panic (44.8%), sadness (41.4%), and lack of concentration/brain fog (41.4%). Socialization, family life, and work were the areas in which quality of life was most impacted. Participants expressed dissatisfaction with their antidepressant treatment. Fast symptom resolution was mentioned as a priority (defined as <1 week by 38.5% of participants and ≤1 month by 65.4%). Most participants had not experienced fast relief from their symptoms with current or previous antidepressant medications. Results of this qualitative study suggest that fatigue, anhedonia, cognitive symptoms, and anxiety are some of the most bothersome symptoms for patients with MDD and highlight the importance of obtaining rapid relief from these symptoms in order to improve outcomes and patient satisfaction with antidepressant medication.","2021","2021","Bernhard T Baune; Ioana Florea; Bjarke Ebert; Maëlys Touya; Anders Ettrup; Monica Hadi; Hongye Ren","Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Münster, Münster, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry, Melbourne Medical School, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Clinical Development, H.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) therapy can effectively manage hypocalcemia; however, the effects of PTH treatment on QOL are unclear. Thirty-one patients with hypoparathyroidism were treated in an open-label study with full replacement subcutaneous PTH 1-34 twice daily for up to 5.3 years, with individualized fine-dosing titration. Prior to initiation of PTH 1-34, conventional therapy was optimized. The 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) Health Survey, Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) were assessed at PTH start (baseline), every 6 months on PTH, and after PTH discontinuation. The SF-36 assesses physical function (PF), physical role limitations (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), emotional role limitations (RE), social function (SF), and mental health (MH). Compared to population norms, patients at baseline had lower scores in RP, GH, VT, and MH (p < 0.05), consistent with impaired QOL. With PTH therapy, only GH at 6 months and VT at 12 months improved (p < 0.05). At the last treatment time point, RP, VT, and SF improved compared to baseline (p < 0.05). However, follow-up scores were unchanged from baseline or last PTH treatment, except for SF, which had decreased at follow-up compared to on-PTH (p < 0.05). On the FSI, there were no changes in fatigue frequency; perceived interference was improved at 12 and 18 months and composite severity was improved only at 60 months (p < 0.05). The 6MWT measures did not change. In conclusion, hypoparathyroidism is associated with decreased QOL. Despite the bias in open-label studies to predict improvements in QOL, PTH therapy had limited and non-sustained effects on QOL, inconclusive changes in fatigue experience, and no change in the 6MWT. Although PTH 1-34 can adequately manage the hypocalcemia in hypoparathyroidism, its effects on QOL appear to be minimal. © 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

The review argues the potential effects of Post COVID-19 Neurological Syndrome (PCNS, also known as Long COVID) with similar pathophysiology. Many patients who have suffered from acute stroke experience long-lasting symptoms affecting several organs including fatigue, brain fog, reduced physical activity, loss of energy, and loss of cognitive reserve, culminating in the loss of independence and poor quality of life. This is very similar to the emerging reports of PCNS from different parts of the world. Stroke, particularly in older adults with comorbidities appears to impact the health and welfare of patients by reducing central neuronal input and neuromuscular function, with muscular atrophy and neuropsychiatric complications. The cumulative effects can potentially lead to a range of physical and cognitive frailty syndromes, which, in many cases may be attributed to persistent, maladapted, low grade, chronic inflammation. Meanwhile, post-COVID-19 Neurological Syndrome (also known as Long COVID Syndrome) appears to share a similar trajectory, adding further urgency for investigations into the mechanisms underlying this constellation of symptoms.","2021","2021 Aug 28","Ebrahim Bani Hassan; Steven Phu; Elyce Warburton; Nihara Humaith; Tissa Wijeratne","Department of Medicine, Australia Institute of Muscular Skeletal Health, Western Health, The University of Melbourne, 176 Furlong Road, St Albans, VIC 3021, Australia.; Falls, Balance and Injury Research Centre, Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), Randwick, NSW 2031, Australia.; Department of Medicine, Australia Institute of Muscular Skeletal Health, Western Health, The University of Melbourne, 176 Furlong Road, St Albans, VIC 3021, Australia.; Falls, Balance and Injury Research Centre, Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), Randwick, NSW 2031, Australia.; Department of Neurology, Sunshine Hospital, 176 Furlong Road, St Albans, VIC 3021, Australia.; Department of Neurology, Sunshine Hospital, 176 Furlong Road, St Albans, VIC 3021, Australia.; Department of Medicine, Australia Institute of Muscular Skeletal Health, Western Health, The University of Melbourne, 176 Furlong Road, St Albans, VIC 3021, Australia.; Department of Neurology, Sunshine Hospital, 176 Furlong Road, St Albans, VIC 3021, Australia.; Department of Public Health, La Trobe University, Bundoora, VIC 3083, Australia.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Rajarata, Saliyapura, Anurdhapura 50008, Sri Lanka."

While COVID-associated anosmia is well-described, knowledge of parosmia (olfactory distortions) and phanthosmia (olfactory hallucinations) is relatively lacking. We undertook a clinical study of the parosmia/phanthosmia phenotype, aiming to support improved prediction and management of these symptoms. In a cross-sectional study between September 2020 and May 2021, we recruited 187 COVID-19 patients with parosmia/phanthosmia via social media and a matched healthy control group from neurologists. The patients received an online video-consultation with a neurologist trained in olfactory research and completed a questionnaire to assess the nature of their subjective olfactory disorder. In the acute period of COVID-19 parosmia/phanthosmia, patients often experienced comorbid manifestations such as fatigue, fever, headache, myalgia, and ""brain fog"". Isolated phanthosmia was observed in 13.9% of acute COVID-19 patients, as compared to 34.2% in the long term. Parosmia was described in 89.8% of patients in the long-term course of the disease. COVID-associated parosmia/phanthosmia was more common in women (81.3%) than men (18.7%). Almost all parosmia/phanthosmia patients had an acute history of anosmia, which often progressed to hyposmia. A third of the patients had a history of taste disturbance The long-term COVID-19 sequelae such as fatigue, brain fog, and dizziness are significantly more common among patients with parosmia/phanthosmia, as were autonomic symptoms such as awareness of heartbeat and rapid pulse. The incidence of migraine with aura was significantly higher in the parosmia/phanthosmia group than in the control group (8% versus 0.9%). The allergy was reported significantly more frequent in the study group compared to the control group. Qualitative olfactory disorders occur frequently in COVID-19 patients. Those with the parosmia/phanthosmia phenotype have a higher risk for other symptoms, notably headache (including migraine with aura), fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, and cardiovascular/autonomic manifestations, as well as allergy. We suppose that further investigation of this phenomenon will reveal phenotypic variants depending on particular symptoms cluster; improved nosology of qualitative olfactory disorders in COIVD-19 is a prerequisite for establishing appropriate treatments.","2021","2021 Sep","Svetlana Kopishinskaia; Daria Lapshova; Mikhail Sherman; Ivan Velichko; Nikolai Voznesensky; Vera Voznesenskaia","Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Neurorehabilitation, Kirov State Medical University, 112 Karl Marx Street, Kirov 610027, Russia, kopishinskaya@gmail.com."

Moreover, the extent to which these symptoms may be associated with neurological, pulmonary, or psychiatric difficulties is unclear. This ongoing cohort study aims to carefully assess neurocognitive function in the context of the neurological, psychiatric, and pulmonary sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with asymptomatic/mild and severe cases of COVID-19 after remission, including actively recruited healthy controls. A total of 150 participants will be included in this pilot study. The cohort will comprise patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection with either an asymptomatic course or a mild course defined as no symptoms except for olfactory and taste dysfunction (n=50), patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection with a severe disease course (n=50), and a healthy control group (n=50) with similar age and sex distribution based on frequency matching. A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment will be performed comprising nuanced aspects of complex attention, including language, executive function, verbal and visual learning, and memory. Psychiatric, personality, social and lifestyle factors, sleep, and fatigue will be evaluated. Brain magnetic resonance imaging, neurological and physical assessment, and pulmonological and lung function examinations (including body plethysmography, diffusion capacity, clinical assessments, and questionnaires) will also be performed. Three visits are planned with comprehensive testing at the baseline and 12-month visits, along with brief neurological and neuropsychological examinations at the 6-month assessment. Blood-based biomarkers of neurodegeneration will be quantified at baseline and 12-month follow-up. At the time of submission, the study had begun recruitment through telephone and in-person screenings. The first patient was enrolled in the study at the beginning of April 2021. Interim data analysis of baseline information is expected to be complete by December 2021 and study completion is expected at the end of December 2022. Preliminary group comparisons indicate worse word list learning, short- and long-delayed verbal recall, and verbal recognition in both patient cohorts compared with those of the healthy control group, adjusted for age and sex. Initial volumetric comparisons show smaller grey matter, frontal, and temporal brain volumes in both patient groups compared with those of healthy controls. These results are quite robust but are neither final nor placed in the needed context intended at study completion.

Seventy patients diagnosed with COVID were randomly selected from 2 large socially and ethnically diverse primary care practices. Of those contactable by telephone, 85% (41/48) agreed to participate in the quality improvement survey. They were interviewed by telephone using a semi-structured questionnaire about community services for COVID-19 patients. Interviews lasted 10 to 15 minutes. Forty-nine percent of patients reported at least 1 post-acute COVID-19 symptom. The most common were severe fatigue (45%), breathlessness (30%), neurocognitive difficulties (such as poor memory), poor concentration and ""brain fog"" (30%), headaches (20%), and joint pain (20%). Many patients felt isolated and fearful, with scant information about community resources and little safety netting advice. Patients also expected more from primary care with over half (56%) recommending regular phone calls and follow up from healthcare staff as the most important approach in their recovery. In line with patients' requests for more support, the practices now routinely refer patients with long COVID to an on-site social prescriber who explores how they are getting on, refers them to the GP or practice nurse when required, and sign posts them to support services in the community.","2021","2021 Jan-Dec","Mohammad Sharif Razai; Roaa Al-Bedaery; Laxmi Anand; Katherine Fitch; Hannah Okechukwu; Teniola M Saraki; Pippa Oakeshott","Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London, London, UK.; Wandsworth Primary Care Network, Chatfield Health Care, London, UK.; Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London, London, UK.; Wandsworth Primary Care Network, Chatfield Health Care, London, UK.; Wandsworth Primary Care Network, Chatfield Health Care, London, UK.; Imperial College London, London, UK.; Imperial College London, London, UK.; Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London, London, UK."

An anonymous 20 question survey was administered to the Facebook group: ""UTAH Breast Implant Illness"" to characterize the symptoms these women attributed to their breast implants. Several questions allowed us to evaluate how implant removal affected women's symptoms. Of the 182 respondents, 97% report that implants negatively affect their health and 95% identify these symptoms with breast implant illness. Ninety-six percent of respondents had implants placed for cosmetic reasons and 51% had silicone implants. The most common symptoms associated with breast implant illness are brain fog (95%), fatigue (92%), joint pain (80%), and hair loss (74%). Sixty percent of respondents learned about breast implant illness from family/friends and/or social media platforms (56%), 40% of respondents had their implants removed, and 97% report relief of their symptoms post-removal (23% complete, 74% partial). Following explantation, there was a significant improvement in all but one reported symptom. An association was found between the number of symptoms reported prior to explantation and the number of symptoms resolving following explantation. Breast implant illness is a syndrome characterized by fatigue, decreased focus, hair loss, and joint pain after the placement of breast implants. Nearly all patients report improvement of symptoms after implant removal.

However, the longitudinal association of biomarkers reflecting CNS impact and neurological symptoms is not known. We sought to determine whether plasma biomarkers of CNS injury were associated with neurologic sequelae after COVID-19. Patients with confirmed acute COVID-19 were studied prospectively. Neurological symptoms were recorded during the acute phase of the disease and at six months follow-up, and blood samples were collected longitudinally. Healthy age-matched individuals were included as controls. We analysed plasma concentrations of neurofilament light-chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp), and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15). One hundred patients with mild (n = 24), moderate (n = 28), and severe (n = 48) COVID-19 were followed for a median (IQR) of 225 (187-262) days. In the acute phase, patients with severe COVID-19 had higher concentrations of NfL than all other groups (all p < 0·001), and higher GFAp than controls (p < 0·001). GFAp was also significantly increased in moderate disease (p < 0·05) compared with controls. NfL (r = 0·53, p < 0·001) and GFAp (r = 0·39, p < 0·001) correlated with GDF-15 during the acute phase. After six months, NfL and GFAp concentrations had normalized, with no persisting group differences. Despite this, 50 patients reported persistent neurological symptoms, most commonly fatigue (n = 40), ""brain-fog"" (n = 29), and changes in cognition (n = 25). We found no correlation between persistent neurological symptoms and CNS injury biomarkers in the acute phase. The normalization of CNS injury biomarkers in all individuals, regardless of previous disease severity or persisting neurological symptoms, indicates that post COVID-19 neurological sequelae are not accompanied by ongoing CNS injury.

Sleep disorders represent one of the most frequent manifestations of PANS, involving around 80% of patients. The present study describes the clinical and polysomnographic features in a group of PANS children identifying the relationships between sleep disorders and other PANS symptoms. All participants underwent a clinical evaluation including comprehensive sleep history, polysomnography, cognitive assessment and blood chemistry examination. A data mining approach with fourth-generation artiﬁcial neural networks has been used in order to discover subtle trends and associations among variables. Polysomnography showed abnormality in 17 out of 23 recruited subjects (73.9%). In particular, 8/17 children (47%) had ineffective sleep, 10/17 (58.8%) fragmented sleep, 8/17 (47.1%) periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) and 11/17 (64.7%) REM-sleep without atonia (RSWA). Most subjects presented more than one sleep disturbances. Notably, among the 19/23 patients diagnosed with Tic/Tourette disorder, 8/19 (42.1%) show PLMD and 10/19 (52.6%) RSWA. Artificial neural network methodology and the auto-contractive map exploited the links among the full spectrum of variables revealing the simultaneous connections among them, facing the complexity of PANS phenotype. Disordered sleep represents, for prevalence and impact on quality of life, a cardinal symptom in patients with PANS. Thus, considering the weight of sleep disturbances on diagnosis and prognosis of PANS, we could consider the possibility of including them among the major diagnostic criteria.","2021","2021","Antonella Gagliano; Monica Puligheddu; Nadia Ronzano; Patrizia Congiu; Marcello Giuseppe Tanca; Ida Cursio; Sara Carucci; Stefano Sotgiu; Enzo Grossi; Alessandro Zuddas","Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Unit, ""Azienda Ospedaliera Brotzu"" Hospital Trust, Cagliari, Italy.; Sleep Disorder Centre, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.; Section of Neuroscience & Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.; Sleep Disorder Centre, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.; Section of Neuroscience & Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.; Section of Neuroscience & Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.; Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Unit, ""Azienda Ospedaliera Brotzu"" Hospital Trust, Cagliari, Italy.; Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University Hospital of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.; Autism Research Unit, Villa Santa Maria Foundation, Como, Italy.; Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Unit, ""Azienda Ospedaliera Brotzu"" Hospital Trust, Cagliari, Italy.; Section of Neuroscience & Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy."

The etiology of POTS has yet to be established. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that POTS may be an autoimmune disorder such as autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, an acquired, immune-mediated form of diffuse autonomic failure. Many patients have serum antibodies that bind to the ganglionic acetylcholine receptors (gAChRs) in the autonomic ganglia. Herein, we describe a 39-year-old female patient with an eight-year history of orthostatic intolerance. POTS was diagnosed based on the findings of a head-up tilt test, in which a rapid increase in the patient's heart rate from 58 bpm in the lying position to 117 bpm in the upright position without orthostatic hypotension was observed. The POTS symptoms were refractory to various medications except for pyridostigmine bromide, which resulted in a partial resolution of her symptoms. Her serum was found to be strongly positive for anti-gAChR (β4 subunit) autoantibody (2.162 A.I., normal range: below 1.0). Based on these findings, a limited form of autoimmune POTS was diagnosed. After obtaining written informed consent, she was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 400 mg/kg/day for five days, which led to clinical improvement by reducing her heart rate increase in the upright position. She was able to return to work with IVIg treatment at regular intervals. Our case provides further evidence of a potential autoimmune pathogenesis for POTS. Aggressive immunotherapy may be effective for POTS even in chronic cases.","2021","2021 Aug 30","Yuya Goto; Yoko Sunami; Keizo Sugaya; Shunya Nakane; Kazushi Takahashi","Department of Neurology, Tokyo Metropolitan Neurological Hospital.; Department of Neurology, Tokyo Metropolitan Neurological Hospital.; Department of Neurology, Tokyo Metropolitan Neurological Hospital.; Department of Molecular Neurology and Therapeutics, Kumamoto University Hospital.; Department of Neurology, Tokyo Metropolitan Neurological Hospital."

First symptoms included fatigue, chills, cervical lymphadenopathy, neck pain and stiffness. Patient was afebrile. Lyme disease was excluded due to lack of erythema migrans and negative enzyme immunoassay test results for anti-Borrelia antibodies. During the next few months, her condition was getting worse and symptoms were accompanied with brain fog, dizziness, palpitations, irregular menstrual cycles, insomnia, panic attacks, headaches, and muscle aches. This led to multiple medical tests and examinations, but the diagnosis failed to be established. Finally, after occurrence of paresthesia and weakness of leg muscles, clinical diagnosis of disseminated Lyme borreliosis with nervous system involvement was suspected and antibiotic therapy was initiated. After the second dose of ceftriaxone, patient got fever and her condition worsened. However, ceftriaxone therapy was continued for a total of 5 days and was followed by 4 weeks of doxycycline therapy. Upon completion of antibiotic therapy, high specific anti-Borrelia antibodies were detected by Western blot and SeraSpot. Appearance of anti-Borrelia antibodies, in contrast to negative test results performed immediately before the therapy started, indicated seroconversion. 18 months after the therapy, patient was completely without the symptoms. This paper emphasizes importance of clinical evaluation of Lyme disease and shows a unique case of seroconversion in patient with symptoms of disseminated Lyme disease. Seroconversion was likely triggered by release of lipoproteins and other immunogenic molecules from Borrelia once the bacterial die-off began due to antibiotic therapy.","2021","2021 Sep","Gordana Blagojević Zagorac; Tanja Grubić Kezele","Department of Physiology, Pathophysiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia. gordana.blagojevic@uniri.hr.; Department of Physiology, Pathophysiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia.; Clinical Department for Clinical Microbiology, Clinical Hospital Center Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia."

We found the prevalence of long COVID symptoms to be 30.3% (56/185), which included 4 initially asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who later developed long COVID symptoms. Next, we found that 66.7% (20/30) of long COVID subjects versus 10% (2/20) of control subjects in our primary study group were positive for EBV reactivation based on positive titers for EBV early antigen-diffuse (EA-D) IgG or EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM. The difference was significant (p < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). A similar ratio was observed in a secondary group of 18 subjects 21-90 days after testing positive for COVID-19, indicating reactivation may occur soon after or concurrently with COVID-19 infection.

The aim of the current study is to explore differences in CFS patients with and without PEM in indicators of aortic stiffness, autonomic nervous system function, and severity of fatigue. One-hundred and one patients met the Fukuda criteria. A Chronic Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ) and Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) were used to assess the level of mental and physical fatigue. Aortic systolic blood pressure (sBPaortic) and the autonomic nervous system were measured with the arteriograph and Task Force Monitor, respectively. Eighty-two patients suffered prolonged PEM according to the Fukuda criteria, while 19 did not. Patients with PEM had higher FIS scores (p = 0.02), lower central systolic blood pressure (p = 0.02) and higher mental fatigue (p = 0.03). For a one-point increase in the mental fatigue component of the CFQ scale, the risk of PEM increases by 34%. For an sBPaortic increase of 1 mmHg, the risk of PEM decreases by 5%. For a one unit increase in sympathovagal balance, the risk of PEM increases by 330%. Higher mental fatigue and sympathetic activity in rest are related to an increased risk of PEM, while higher central systolic blood pressure is related to a reduced risk of PEM. However, none of the between group differences were significant after FDR correction, and therefore conclusions should be treated with caution and replicated in further studies.","2021","2021 May 26","Sławomir Kujawski; Joanna Słomko; Lynette Hodges; Derek F H Pheby; Modra Murovska; Julia L Newton; Paweł Zalewski","Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology, Ergonomics and Postgraduate Education, Division of Ergonomics and Exercise Physiology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, 85-094 Bydgoszcz, Poland.; Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology, Ergonomics and Postgraduate Education, Division of Ergonomics and Exercise Physiology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, 85-094 Bydgoszcz, Poland.; School of Sport, Exercise and Nutrition, Massey University, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand.; Society and Health, Buckinghamshire New University (Retired), High Wycombe HP11 2JZ, UK.; Institute of Microbiology and Virology, Riga Stradiņš University, LV-1067 Riga, Latvia.; Population Health Sciences Institute, The Medical School, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE2 4AX, UK.; Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology, Ergonomics and Postgraduate Education, Division of Ergonomics and Exercise Physiology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, 85-094 Bydgoszcz, Poland."

While gluten-induced neurocognitive impairment (GINI; eg, ""celiac fog"" or ""brain fog"") is commonly described by individuals with CD and NCGS, there are little data regarding the prevalence and symptoms associated with these experiences. A 9-question online survey was accessed by 1396 individuals (1143 with CD; 253 with NCGS). Forced choice and free-response questions were asked of participants to obtain a description of neurocognitive symptoms experienced after gluten ingestion. Free-response answers were coded using a coding structure developed based on the Health-Related Quality of Life Instrument. The majority of survey participants (89% of CD and 95% of NCGS) reported having GINI symptoms. When describing symptoms, the most common word descriptors for both groups were difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and grogginess. Timing of symptoms, including onset and symptom peak, were similar across the 2 groups. Coding of free responses found the most common references were to cognitive, physical, psychological, and overall quality of life impacts. This survey suggests that GINI is common and may be severe in both individuals with CD and NCGS. Cognitive impairment and decline in physical functioning may be similar to that occurring in other illnesses, such as lupus. Clinical follow-up with both individuals with CD and NCGS should include assessment of GINI symptoms. Further research is warranted, including the development of a patient-reported outcome measure including neurocognitive effects of gluten exposure.","2022","2022 Aug 01","Jessica B Edwards George; Babatunde Aideyan; Kayla Yates; Kristin N Voorhees; Jennifer O'Flynn; Kristen Sweet; Kate Avery; Alan Ehrlich; Alice Bast; Daniel A Leffler","Department of Applied Psychology, Bouvé College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA.; Department of Applied Psychology, Bouvé College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA.; Department of Applied Psychology, Bouvé College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA.; Beyond Celiac, Ambler, PA.; Department of Applied Psychology, Bouvé College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA.; Beyond Celiac, Ambler, PA.; Beyond Celiac, Ambler, PA.; Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester.; Beyond Celiac, Ambler, PA.; Takeda, Cambridge.; Celiac Center, Division of Gastroenterology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."

'Long COVID' involves the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs, including cognitive impairment or 'brain fog' and chronic fatigue syndrome. There are similarities in these persistent complications between SARS-CoV-2 and the Ebola, Zika, and influenza A viruses. Normal CNS neuronal mitochondrial function requires high oxygen levels for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. Recent studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can hijack mitochondrial function. Persistent changes in cognitive functioning have also been reported with other viral infections. SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in long-term effects on immune processes within the CNS by causing microglial dysfunction. This short opinion aims to discuss the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of long-term neuropsychiatric COVID-19 involves microglia, mitochondria, and persistent neuroinflammation.","2021","2021 May 10","George B Stefano; Pascal Büttiker; Simon Weissenberger; Anders Martin; Radek Ptacek; Richard M Kream","Center for Cognitive and Molecular Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.; Center for Cognitive and Molecular Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.; Center for Cognitive and Molecular Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.; Department of Psychology, University of New York in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.; Center for Cognitive and Molecular Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.; Center for Cognitive and Molecular Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.; Center for Cognitive and Molecular Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic."

During her acute infection phase, she had a home recovery and reported her predominant symptoms as fatigue, headaches, body pain, and shortness of breath. After most of her symptoms were resolved, she continued to have periodic episodes of fatigue and headaches, along with random shortness of breath while at rest and during activities for months beyond the acute phase of the illness. She also noted the presence of ""brain fog,"" as if lacking the same clarity that she had prior to her illness.

Eighteen young, healthy, active participants (22.6 [3.1] y, 33% F, 24.3 [3.7] kg/m2 ) sat for 3 hr after consuming an HGI or LGI meal. Using Doppler ultrasound to measure internal carotid (ICA) and vertebral (VA) artery blood flow, QBrain was calculated: (ICA blood flow + VA blood flow) × 2. Executive function was assessed using the Stroop Test and Trail Making Test-Part B. Brain fog was measured using a modified Borg Category Scale with Ratio properties (CR10). Following 3 hr of sitting, there was a significant decrease in QBrain with time (p = .001, ES = -0.26), though there were nonsignificant interaction (p = .216) and condition effects (p = .174).

Traditional sustained attention tasks commonly measure this capacity as the ability to detect target stimuli based on sensory features in the auditory or visual domains. However, with this approach, discrete target stimuli may exogenously capture attention to aid detection, thereby masking deficits in the ability to endogenously sustain attention over time. To address this, we developed the Continuous Temporal Expectancy Task (CTET) where individuals continuously monitor a stream of patterned stimuli alternating at a fixed temporal interval (690 ms) and detect an infrequently occurring target stimulus defined by a prolonged temporal duration (1020 ms or longer). As such, sensory properties of target and non-target stimuli are perceptually identical and differ only in temporal duration. Using the CTET, we assessed stroke survivors with unilateral right hemisphere damage (N = 14), a cohort in which sustained attention deficits have been extensively reported. Stroke survivors had overall lower target detection accuracy compared with neurologically healthy age-matched older controls (N = 18). Critically, stroke survivors performance was characterised by significantly steeper within-block performance decrements, which occurred within short temporal windows (˜3 ½ min), and were restored by the break periods between blocks. These findings suggest that continuous temporal monitoring taxes sustained attention processes to capture clinical deficits in this capacity over time, and outline a precise measure of the endogenous processes hypothesised to underpin sustained attention deficits following right hemisphere stroke.","2022","2022 Mar","M B Brosnan; P M Dockree; S Harty; D J Pearce; J M Levenstein; C R Gillebert; M A Bellgrove; R G O'Connell; I H Robertson; N Demeyere","Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience and School of Psychology, College Green, Dublin 2, D02 PN40, Ireland.; Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Anna Watts Building, Woodstock Road, Oxford, OX2 6GG, UK.; Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, University of Oxford, Univesity Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, OX3 7JX, UK.; School of Psychological Sciences and Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, Monash University, Clayton, Melbourne, VIC3800, Australia.; Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience and School of Psychology, College Green, Dublin 2, D02 PN40, Ireland.; Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience and School of Psychology, College Green, Dublin 2, D02 PN40, Ireland.; Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Anna Watts Building, Woodstock Road, Oxford, OX2 6GG, UK.; School of Psychological Sciences and Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, Monash University, Clayton, Melbourne, VIC3800, Australia.; Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Anna Watts Building, Woodstock Road, Oxford, OX2 6GG, UK.; Section on Functional Imaging Methods, Laboratory of Brain and Cognition, National Institutes of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD20892, USA.; Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, University of Oxford, Univesity Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, OX3 7JX, UK.; Department of Brain and Cognition, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.; School of Psychological Sciences and Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, Monash University, Clayton, Melbourne, VIC3800, Australia.; Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience and School of Psychology, College Green, Dublin 2, D02 PN40, Ireland.; School of Psychological Sciences and Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, Monash University, Clayton, Melbourne, VIC3800, Australia.; Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience and School of Psychology, College Green, Dublin 2, D02 PN40, Ireland.; Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Anna Watts Building, Woodstock Road, Oxford, OX2 6GG, UK."

Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can directly or indirectly affect the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, diseases associated with sequelae of COVID-19, or 'long COVID', also include serious long-term mental and cognitive changes, including the condition recently termed 'brain fog'. Hypoxia in the microenvironment of select brain areas may benefit the reproductive capacity of the virus. It is possible that in areas of cerebral hypoxia, neuronal cell energy metabolism may become compromised after integration of the viral genome, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Because of their need for constant high metabolism, cerebral tissues require an immediate and constant supply of oxygen. In hypoxic conditions, neurons with the highest oxygen demand become dysfunctional. The resulting cognitive impairment benefits viral spread, as infected individuals exhibit behaviors that reduce protection against infection. The effects of compromised mitochondrial function may also be an evolutionary advantage for SARS-CoV-2 in terms of host interaction. A high viral load in patients with COVID-19 that involves the CNS results in the compromise of neurons with high-level energy metabolism.

Methods and Results We evaluated cognitive and hemodynamic responses (cardiovascular and cerebral: heart rate, blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the middle cerebral artery at baseline, after initial cognitive testing, and after (30-minutes duration) prolonged cognitive stress test (PCST) whilst seated; as well as after 5-minute standing in consecutively enrolled participants with POTS (n=22) and healthy controls (n=18). Symptom severity was quantified with orthostatic hypotensive questionnaire at baseline and end of study. Subjects in POTS and control groups were frequency age- and sex-matched (29±11 versus 28±13 years; 86 versus 72% women, respectively; both P≥0.4). The CBFv decreased in both groups (condition, P=0.04) following PCST, but a greater reduction in CBFv was observed in the POTS versus control group (-7.8% versus -1.8%; interaction, P=0.038). Notably, the reduced CBFv following PCST in the POTS group was similar to that seen during orthostatic stress (60.0±14.9 versus 60.4±14.8 cm/s). Further, PCST resulted in greater slowing in psychomotor speed (6.1% versus 1.4%, interaction, P=0.027) and a greater increase in symptom scores at study completion (interaction, P<0.001) in the patients with POTS, including increased difficulty with concentration. All other physiologic responses (blood pressure and end-tidal carbon dioxide) did not differ between groups after PCST (all P>0.05). Conclusions Reduced CBFv and cognitive dysfunction were evident in patients with POTS following prolonged cognitive stress even in the absence of orthostatic stress.","2020","2020 Dec 15","Rachel Wells; Varun Malik; Anthony G Brooks; Dominik Linz; Adrian D Elliott; Prashanthan Sanders; Amanda Page; Mathias Baumert; Dennis H Lau","Centre for Heart Rhythm Disorders The University of Adelaide Adelaide Australia.; Department of Medicine Royal Adelaide Hospital Adelaide Australia.; Centre for Heart Rhythm Disorders The University of Adelaide Adelaide Australia.; Department of Cardiology Royal Adelaide Hospital Adelaide Australia.; Centre for Heart Rhythm Disorders The University of Adelaide Adelaide Australia.; Centre for Heart Rhythm Disorders The University of Adelaide Adelaide Australia.; Department of Cardiology Royal Adelaide Hospital Adelaide Australia.; Centre for Heart Rhythm Disorders The University of Adelaide Adelaide Australia.; Centre for Heart Rhythm Disorders The University of Adelaide Adelaide Australia.; Department of Cardiology Royal Adelaide Hospital Adelaide Australia.; Centre for Nutrition and Gastrointestinal Diseases The University of Adelaide Adelaide Australia.; Centre for Heart Rhythm Disorders The University of Adelaide Adelaide Australia.; School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering The University of Adelaide Adelaide Australia.; Centre for Heart Rhythm Disorders The University of Adelaide Adelaide Australia.; Department of Cardiology Royal Adelaide Hospital Adelaide Australia."

Sixty-nine patients met the Fukuda criteria. Patients completed baseline measures assessing fatigue, autonomic nervous system (ANS), cognitive, and cardiovascular function. Thirty-four patients completed a home-based SEP consisting of 10-40 min per day at between 30 and 80% actual HR max. Exercise intensity and time was increased gradually across the 16 weeks and baseline measures were repeated following the SEP. Thirty-five patients discontinued, while 34 completed SEP. For every increase in sympathetic drive for blood pressure control as measured by the taskforce, completion of SEP decreased by a multiple of 0.1. For a 1 millisecond increase in reaction time for the simple reaction time (SRT), the probability for completion of SEP also decreases by a multiple of 0.01. For a one beat HRmax increase, there is a 4% increase in the odds of completing SEP. The more sympathetic drive in the control of blood vessels, the longer the reaction time on simple visual stimuli and the lower the HRmax during physical exercise, then the lower the chance of SEP completion in ME/CFS.","2020","2020 Oct 26","Sławomir Kujawski; Jo Cossington; Joanna Słomko; Helen Dawes; James Wl Strong; Fernando Estevez-Lopez; Modra Murovska; Julia L Newton; Lynette Hodges; Paweł Zalewski","Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology, Ergonomy and Postgraduate Education, Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, M.

However, increasing evidence suggests that many such patients who either recovered from or had mild symptoms after COVID-19 exhibit diffuse, multiorgan, symptoms months after the infection. These symptoms include malaise, myalgias, chest tightness, brain fog and other neuropsychiatric symptoms that were originally reported in children and named Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C).

Several postinfectious presumably autoimmune complications of COVID-19 affecting the brain or peripheral large nerve fibers have been reported.

Initially, the patient was diagnosed with. OCHOS (detected by the tilt test with transcranial Doppler monitoring) and SFN (confirmed by skin biopsy), and both OCHOS/SFN were attributed to Post Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome of presumed autoimmune etiology. Patient recovered on symptomatic therapy. COVID-19 triggered exacerbation of OCHOS/SFN responded to immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulins. This case suggests that post COVID-19 syndrome may present as an autoimmune OCHOS/SFN and that early immunotherapy may be effective.

In the ensuing years, the patient was treated with 35 psychiatric medications. Additionally, she experienced numerous hospitalizations and received over 30 electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments. Despite this extensive conventional treatment, she reported limited gains. In October 2017, the patient committed to the Vital Mind Reset (VMR) online program and implemented a series of lifestyle changes over 44 days, starting with 30 days of dietary, meditation, and lifestyle protocols, followed by supplementation. Notably, the patient has since resolved both physical and psychiatric symptoms including fatigue, acne, migraines, cold sweats, dizziness, nausea, blood sugar crashes, resting tremors, brain fog, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, auditory hallucinations, and delusions. In this patient's case, hypertension, bradycardia, headaches, increased frequency of mania, tremors, insomnia, and weight gain accompanied her medications. This case exemplifies the dramatic resolution of disabling psychiatric symptoms after engagement in the lifestyle interventions outlined in the VMR program, medication taper, and supplementation.

Recent studies indicate that palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) exerts metabolic effects and holds neuroprotective potential. However, studies on HFD exposure in mice which investigate the effects of PEA on monoamine system and synaptic plasticity are limited. In C57Bl/6J male mice, obesity was established by HFD feeding for 12 weeks. Then, mice were treated with ultra-micronized PEA (30 mg·kg-1 daily p.o.) or vehicle for 7 weeks along with HFD. Mice receiving chow diet and vehicle served as controls. Thereafter, depressive-, anhedonic-like behaviour and cognitive performance were measured. Monoamine analyses were performed on brain areas (nucleus accumbens, Nac; prefrontal cortex, PFC; hippocampus), and markers of synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis were evaluated in hippocampus. PEA limited depressive- and anhedonic-like behaviour, and cognitive deficits induced by HFD. PEA induced an increase in 5-HT levels in PFC, and a reduction of dopamine and 5-HT turnover in Nac and PFC, respectively. Moreover, PEA increased dopamine levels in the hippocampus and PFC. At a molecular level, PEA restored brain-derived neurotrophic factor signalling pathway in hippocampus and PFC, indicating an improvement of synaptic plasticity. In particular, PEA counteracted the reduction of glutamatergic synaptic density induced by HFD in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 of the hippocampus, where it also exhibited neurogenesis-promoting abilities.

KD is an evidence-based treatment for intractable epilepsy. KD is also self-administered, with limited evidence of efficacy, for conditions including weight loss, cognitive and memory enhancement, type II diabetes, cancer, neurological and psychiatric disorders. A commonly discussed side effect of KD in media and online forums is ""keto flu,"" a cluster of transient symptoms generally reported as occurring within the first few weeks of KD. This study aimed to characterize the pattern of symptoms, severity and time course of keto flu as related by users of online forums. Method: Online forums referring to ""keto flu,"" ""keto-induction,"" or ""keto-adaptation"" in the URL were identified in Google. Passages describing personal experiences of keto flu were categorized manually with reference to pattern of symptoms, severity, time course, and remedies proposed. Results: The search criteria identified 75 online forums, 43 met inclusion criteria and contained 448 posts from 300 unique users. Seventy-three made more than one post (mean 3.12, range 2-11). Descriptors of personal experience of keto flu, reported by 101 of 300 users, included 256 symptom descriptions involving 54 discrete symptoms. Commonest symptoms were ""flu,"" headache, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, ""brain fog,"" gastrointestinal discomfort, decreased energy, feeling faint and heartbeat alterations. Symptom reports peaked in the first and dwindled after 4 weeks. Resolution of keto flu symptoms was reported by eight users between days 3 and 30 (median 4.5, IQR 3-15). Severity of symptoms, reported by 60 users in 40 forums, was categorized as mild (N = 15), moderate (N = 23), or severe (N = 22). Eighteen remedies were proposed by 121 individual users in 225 posts. Conclusions: Typically, individual posts provided fragmentary descriptions related to the flow of forum conversations. A composite picture emerged across 101 posts describing personally experienced symptoms. User conversations were generally supportive, sharing remedies for keto flu reflecting assumptions of physiological effects of KD.","2020","2020","Emmanuelle C S Bostock; Kenneth C Kirkby; Bruce V Taylor; Jason A Hawrelak","Menzies Institute for Medical Research, Hobart, TAS, Australia.; Psychiatry, University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS, Australia.; Neurology, Menzies Institute for Medical Research, Hobart, TAS, Australia.; College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS, Australia.; Australian Research Centre for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia."

One hypothesis to understand the mechanisms of cognitive impairment in SLE is accelerated immunosenescence. The aim of this study is to observe the correlation between immunosenescence with cognitive impairment in patients with SLE. Sixty-one female SLE patient were measured for CD4 and CD8 T cell-associated senescence markers, including percentage of end-stage differentiated T cells (CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing CD57+ or loss of CD28 expression), of naïve T cells (CD4+ CD45RA+ and CD8+ CD45RA+ ), memory T cells (CD4+ CD45RO+ and CD8+ CD45RO+ ), and antigen-experienced T cells (CD4+ KLRG1+ and CD8+ KLRG1+ ) which were measured using flow cytometry. One hallmark of immunosenescence called immune risk profile (IRP) was defined by an inverted ratio of CD4 and CD8. Cognitive functions were measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montréal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) questionnaire. Thirty-six (59.1%) SLE patients who had IRP develop significantly lower attention and recall from both MMSE (P = .005 and P = .000) and MOCA (P = .017 and P = .000) examinations. Decreased visuospatial ability was also found in patients with IRP measured by MOCA (P = .046).

The aim of this study was to assess self-reported symptoms of impaired concentration in coeliac disease before and after treatment with gluten-free diet, compared with healthy controls and patient controls. Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease were included consecutively from two out-patient clinics. The patients completed the questionnaires Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale v1.1 Symptoms Checklist (ASRS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) prior to start of a gluten-free diet and after at least 12 months on the diet. Patients with an established diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease served as patient controls (n = 36). Health care personnel at Oslo University Hospital served as healthy controls (n = 60) and filled out ASRS and HADS. Results: A total of 31 newly diagnosed coeliac patients were included in the study. Of these, 26 patients met for follow-up and repeated the questionnaires. Prior to treatment, patients with coeliac disease had significantly higher scores than healthy controls on both the ASRS (p = .0014) and HADS (p=.0004).

In some cases, they are the first clinical manifestation, preceding the diagnosis of pSS by two years on average. A systematic review was conducted to explore cognitive impairment in pSS, with reference to diagnostic methods and their relationship with laboratory data and clinical manifestations. According to the PRISMA 2009 checklist, we carried out a comprehensive literature search in the three main bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO (NICE HDAS interface). The following main search terms were used: primary Sjogren syndrome, neurological manifestations, fatigue, cognitive functions, psychiatric manifestations, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and neurocognitive disorder. The search was made on 14 September, 2018. References from all selected studies were also examined. Inclusion criteria were: all studies and case-reports published in any language from 2002 that assessed the association of pSS (according to classification criteria proposed by the 2002 American/European collaborative group (AECG)) with all types of cognitive impairment (including dementia). Exclusion criteria were: reviews, abstracts, secondary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and all articles in which other classification criteria were used. The initial search yielded 352 articles, of which 253 were excluded based on the title and abstract review. A total of 54 articles underwent a full-length review, and 32 articles were excluded. Data were extracted from 18 studies and three case-reports involving a total of 6196 participants. In most cases, cognitive dysfunction was a brain fog or a mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Occasionally, an autoimmune dementia was present. The relationship between pSS and degenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), was a controversial issue, even if some investigators hypothesized that pSS could be a risk factor. Several unmet needs were highlighted. First, some of the included studies had not reported the severity of pSS; hence, few correlations between disease severity and cognitive function were possible. Secondly, the evaluation of the pathogenetic role of comorbid diseases was often absent. The lack of information on the type of dementia represented a third critical point in the majority of the included studies. This systematic review confirmed that adequate studies on cognitive function in pSS are scarce, mostly performed on small-sized samples, and often conflicting. The routine assessment of cognitive function in patients with pSS seems advisable and it will help to elucidate some of the unmet needs highlighted by this review in future appropriately designed studies.","2019","2019 Apr 15","Ciro Manzo; Eva Martinez-Suarez; Melek Kechida; Marco Isetta; Jordi Serra-Mestres","Rheumatologic Outpatient Clinic and Gerontorheumatology Service, ""Mariano Lauro"" Hospital, 80065 Sant'Agnello, Italy. cirmanzo@libero.it.; Center for Cognitive Diseases and Dementias, Azienda Sanitaria Locale Napoli 3 sud, 80038 Pomigliano d'Arco, Italy. cirmanzo@libero.it.; Geriatrician, Hospital de Mataró (Barcelona), 08304 Mataró, Barcelona, Spain. emartinezsu@csdm.cat.; Internal Medicine and Endocrinology Department, Fattouma Bourguiba University Hospital, University of Monastir, 5000 Monastir, Tunisia. kechida_mel_lek@hotmail.com.; Library and Knowledge Services, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, London UB8 3NN, UK. marco.isetta@nhs.net.; Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, London UB8 3NN, UK. jordi.serra-mestres@nhs.net."

In time trade-off interviews, migraine patients and general population participants in the UK valued health state vignettes drafted based on literature, medication labels, and clinician interviews. All respondents valued migraine health states varying in route of administration. Each participant also valued eight health states (randomly selected from a total of 15) that added the description of an AE to a migraine health state. A total of 400 participants completed interviews (200 general population [49.0% female; mean age = 43.6 years]; 200 migraine patients [74.5% female; mean age = 45.8 years]). In the general population sample, mean utilities of health states without aura were 0.79 with daily oral medication, 0.78 with one injection per month, and 0.72 with 31-39 injections once every 3 months. The greatest disutilities (i.e., decreases in utility) were for AEs associated with oral medications (e.g., - 0.060 [fatigue] and - 0.098 [brain fog]). Differences among health states followed the same pattern in the patient sample as in the general population sample. Utilities estimated from the general population sample may be used to represent route of administration and AEs in cost-utility models.

Although previous research reveals that the APOE ε4 variant impacts the clearance capacity and degradation of β-amyloid from the brain, as compared with APOE ε3 (wild type with normal risk) and APOE ε2 (variant with accelerated clearance and reduced risk), little has been documented about APOE ε4's dual role in cholesterol transport, both peripheral and cerebral, and the effects of sluggish APOE ε4 cholesterol transport on cerebral metabolic rate. An understanding of the connection between brain metabolism and brain fat/cholesterol transport may unlock new prevention strategies for treating patients with a comorbidity of metabolic syndrome (MetS) with cognitive impairment. Recent findings suggest that the APOE ε4 carrier impedes the shuttling of lipids from neurons and circumvents the storage of fat within the glia lipid droplets. This sluggish transport of lipids to triglyceride droplets in the glia cells can lead to dangerous reactive oxygen species and hydroxyl-free radicals as lipids are prematurely oxidized. This case study evaluates the effects of a 10-week clinically prescribed ketogenic diet (KD) with a 68-year-old male, heterozygous APOE ε4 carrier, with a dual diagnosis of mild AD and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The patient was administering both long- and short-acting injectable insulin to mediate his T2DM for 15+ years. Clinical goals of the intervention included increased hypothalamic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as measured via blood ketones with the Abbott Precision Xtra Blood Ketone Meter to confirm metabolic flexibility; controlled plasma glucose as measured via Abbott Precision Xtra Blood Glucose Meter and HgA1c via venous draw; normalization of lipid panel via venous draw and improved memory with restoration of cognitive functionality measured via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is considered to be a gold standard assessment in the diagnosis of early AD. Physiological biomarkers for T2DM/MetS and cognitive functionality were assessed before/during/after intervention. These measures included HOMA-IR, triglycerides/HDL ratio, HgA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, complete fasting lipid panel and the PEAK mobile application for real-time measurement of cognitive improvement. The results were statistically significant. The patient's baseline Montreal Cognitive Assessment improved from 23/30 (mild AD) to 29/30 (normal ≥ 26). His T2DM was reversed. Pre-intervention HgA1c was 7.8% (T2DM); post intervention HgA1c measured 5.5% (normal). Likewise, the patient achieved statistically significant improvements in the other aforementioned biomarkers of MetS. The results of this case study suggest that a clinically prescribed ketogenic diet has strong potential to restore systemic insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility in diabetic, APOE ε4 heterozygous carriers. Mechanisms of action point to normalization of homeostatic negative feedback loops resetting/restoring lipid synthesis/utilization and glucose (insulin)/fatty acid (glucagon) utilization/production in both the body and brain, resulting in increased cerebral metabolism, improved cognition, and reversal of T2DM via renewed cellular insulin sensitivity.","2019","2019 Dec","Seth Stoykovich; Kelly Gibas","Bethel University, St. Paul, MN, USA.; Bethel University, St. Paul, MN, USA."

They can be debilitating, and often do not resolve despite improvement in haemodynamic symptoms. Our analysis was intended to assess clinical outcomes of medication treatment for these symptoms in a large, single-centre paediatric programme.Materials and MethodsWe performed a retrospective review of patients treated for fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. Patients aged 18 years or younger at the time of initial diagnosis were included. Patients who had a specific medication ordered five or more times for these symptoms were confirmed by chart review for clinical improvement. Percentage of patients with clinical improvement for each medication and overall for all medications, as well as the number of medications per patient required to achieve improvement, were assessed. Data were analysed based on gender as well. t-Test and χ2 analyses were used to assess for differences between means in variables, or specific variables. RESULTS: A total of 708 patients met study criteria, of whom 517 were treated for fatigue or brain fog. Overall efficacy was 68.8%, with individual medication effectiveness ranging from 53.1 (methylphenidate) to 16.5% (atomoxetine). There was no significant difference in efficacy with respect to gender. The median number of medications used per patient was 2, without gender difference. Therapy was limited by side effects or lack of efficacy.DiscussionMedications are effective in the improvement of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in these patients. However, trials of multiple medications may be needed before achieving clinical improvement.","2018","2018 Dec","Jeffrey R Boris; Thomas Bernadzikowski","1Division of Cardiology,The Children's Hospital of PhiladelphiaandThe Perelman School of Medicine,University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia, PA,USA.; 2Division of Cardiology,The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,Philadelphia, PA,USA."

They originate from pathogenic fungi and have a crucial role in inflammatory response, causing a broad range of diseases. Immune suppressed subjects may develop mycoses caused by opportunistic common pathogenic fungi. Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells involved in the pathophysiology of infected skin, lung, and organs, where there is an increase of angiogenesis. Airways fungi infections can induce allergic lung disease mediated by MCs and other immune cells. In addition, fungal infection may cause and/or aggravate asthma inflammation. Spores are able to navigate in the airways of the lung and can be recognized trough toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling by the innate immune cells including MCs. Activated MCs release preformed mediators including histamine, proteases (tryptase, chimase), pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and they also generate arachidonic acid products. MCs activated by fungi provoke an increases of PGD2 levels and lead to hypersensitivity diseases which present signs such as irritation of the respiratory tract and eyes, recurrent sinusitis, bronchitis, cough and neurological manifestations including fatigue, nausea, headaches and brain fog. Therefore, fungi activate the innate immune response through the TLRs, leading to the release of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) which, with a series of cascade reactions, induces the stimulation of AP-1 and NF-kB with subsequent activation of inflammatory IL-1 family members. Here, we report that fungi can activate MCs to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines which may be inhibited by IL-37, a new anti-inflammatory IL-1 family member.","2018","2018 Jul-Aug","S K Kritas; C E Gallenga; C D Ovidio; G Ronconi; Al Caraffa; E Toniato; D Lauritano; P Conti","Department of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece.; Department of Biomedical Sciences and Specialist Surgery, Section of Ophthalmology, University of Ferrara, Italy.; Section of Legal Medicine, Department of Medicine and Aging Sciences, G. dAnnunzio University of ChietiPescara, Italy.; UOS Clinica dei Pazienti del Territorio, Policlinico Gemelli, Rome, Italy.; Department of Pharmacology, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, University G. dAnnunzio of Chieti-Pescara, Chieti, Italy.; University of Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy.; Immunology Division, Postgraduate Medical School, University of Chieti-Pescara, Chieti, Italy."

Written informed consent was obtained. Twenty-five patients (18 women; mean age, 46.8 ± 15.3 years) with a diagnosis of GDD were included. All patients had received at least 1 administration of a gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agent. Patients received 3 treatment sessions with Ca-/Zn-DTPA, 15 with treatments spaced 1 month apart, and 10 with treatments spaced 1 week apart. In all cases, every treatment consisted of an application of Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA separated by 24 hours. Measurements of 24-hour urine Gd content before dosing and on the first and second days of therapy were performed. Symptomatic improvement of patients was determined by use of a 10-point scale of patient symptoms. Serum electrolytes were quantified. Gadolinium content increased in the urine, with an overall mean of 30.3-fold increase in the monthly regimen (P < 0.001) and 12.9-fold in the weekly regimen (P < 0.001). Eleven patients experienced transient worsening of at least some of their symptoms, termed a ""flare-up"" phenomenon, in most of whom symptoms improved or receded. Overall, symptoms improved in 13 patients, unchanged in 10, and worse in 2. Significant clinical improvement was present for headache, brain fog, and bone pain for the monthly regimen and arm pain and leg pain for the weekly regimen. There were no significant changes in major serum electrolytes. Three courses of intravenous Ca-/Zn-DTPA therapy results in significantly increased urine content of Gd after treatment and moderate symptomatic improvement.","2018","2018 Jun","Richard C Semelka; Miguel Ramalho; Michael Jay; Lisa Hickey; Joseph Hickey",""

In this paper, we apply Bidirectional LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks to classify students' confusion in watching online course videos from EEG data. The results show that Bidirectional LSTM model achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other machine learning approaches, and shows strong robustness as evaluated by cross-validation. We can predict whether or not a student is confused in the accuracy of 73.3%. Furthermore, we find the most important feature to detecting the brain confusion is the gamma 1 wave of EEG signal.

A convenience sample of 138 participants (aged 14-29) with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome completed questionnaires that assessed fatigue, brain fog symptom severity, activities that improve brain fog, and brain fog-related disability. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the Fatigue Types Questionnaire, and a three-factor solution was produced. Factor scores were then used to cluster the patients into groups using a TwoStep cluster analysis. This resulted in two clusters, a high severity group and a low severity group. The clusters were then compared on a number of items related to symptom expression. Individuals within the more severe cluster had significantly more brain fog at the beginning and end of the survey when compared to cluster two. Those in the more severe cluster also described more activity impairment as well as more frequent, more severe, and more debilitation from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and brain fog.

Thirty patients and 8 doctors participated. Patient themes included emotionality associated with diagnosis, classification of signs and symptoms, and challenges with treatment. They expressed confusion over their diagnosis, and frustration with the state of knowledge their providers had regarding MTHFR. Testing indications included: fatigue (21%), hormone imbalances (13%), and neurological symptoms (13%) including brain fog (8%). Patients reported improvements in physical (60%) and mental/behavioral symptoms (36%) following treatment. A minority of participants reported side effects, but they occurred in almost every body system and ranged in severity. Doctors relied on trial and error to determine treatment doses, frequency and components.

Information processing efficacy, memory, visuospatial ability, motoric function and attention were tested. Small bowel biopsies were collected via routine gastroscopy at weeks 12 and 52 and were compared to baseline Marsh scores. Cognitive performance was compared to serum concentrations of tissue transglutaminase antibodies, biopsy outcomes and other biological markers. All patients had excellent adherence to the diet. Marsh scores improved significantly (P = 0.001, Friedman's test) and tissue transglutaminase antibody concentrations decreased from a mean of 58.4 at baseline to 16.8 U/mL at week 52 (P = 0.025). Four of the cognitive tests assessing verbal fluency, attention and motoric function showed significant improvement over the 12 months and strongly correlated with the Marsh scores and tissue transglutaminase antibody levels (r = 0.377-0.735; all P < 0.05). However, no meaningful patterns of correlations were found for nutritional or biochemical markers, or markers of intestinal permeability. In newly diagnosed coeliac disease, cognitive performance improves with adherence to the gluten-free diet in parallel to mucosal healing. Suboptimal levels of cognition in untreated coeliac disease may affect the performance of everyday tasks.","2014","2014 Jul","I T Lichtwark; E D Newnham; S R Robinson; S J Shepherd; P Hosking; P R Gibson; G W Yelland","School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Australia."

The most frequently reported brain fog triggers were fatigue (91 %), lack of sleep (90 %), prolonged standing (87 %), dehydration (86 %), and feeling faint (85 %). Although aggravated by upright posture, brain fog was reported to persist after assuming a recumbent posture. The most frequently reported interventions for the treatment of brain fog were intravenous saline (77 %), stimulant medications (67 %), salt tablets (54 %), intra-muscular vitamin B-12 injections (48 %), and midodrine (45 %). Descriptors for ""brain fog"" are most consistent with it being a cognitive complaint. Factors other than upright posture may play a role in the persistence of this symptom. Subjects reported a number of therapeutic interventions for brain fog not typically used in the treatment of POTS that may warrant further investigation.","2013","2013 Dec","Amanda J Ross; Marvin S Medow; Peter C Rowe; Julian M Stewart","Department of Behavioral Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA."

The cognitive symptoms are generally thought to be a mild cognitive impairment, but individuals with CFS subjectively describe them as ""brain fog."" The impairment is not fully understood and often is described as slow thinking, difficulty focusing, confusion, lack of concentration, forgetfulness, or a haziness in thought processes. Causes of ""brain fog"" and mild cognitive impairment have been investigated. Possible physiological correlates may be due to the effects of chronic orthostatic intolerance (OI) in the form of the Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) and decreases in cerebral blood flow (CBF). In addition, fMRI studies suggest that individuals with CFS may require increased cortical and subcortical brain activation to complete difficult mental tasks. Furthermore, neurocognitive testing in CFS has demonstrated deficits in speed and efficiency of information processing, attention, concentration, and working memory. The cognitive impairments are then perceived as an exaggerated mental fatigue. As a whole, this is experienced by those with CFS as ""brain fog"" and may be viewed as the interaction of physiological, cognitive, and perceptual factors. Thus, the cognitive symptoms of CFS may be due to altered CBF activation and regulation that are exacerbated by a stressor, such as orthostasis or a difficult mental task, resulting in the decreased ability to readily process information, which is then perceived as fatiguing and experienced as ""brain fog."" Future research looks to further explore these interactions, how they produce cognitive impairments, and explain the perception of ""brain fog"" from a mechanistic standpoint.","2013","2013","Anthony J Ocon","Departments of Physiology/Medicine, Center for Hypotension, New York Medical College Valhalla, NY, USA."

The clinical consequences of an insufficiently mindful vegetarian or vegan diet include many common symptoms such as anxiety, brain fog, depression, fatigue, insomnia, neuropathies and other neurologic dysfunction. Patients with such symptoms who report having a vegetarian or vegan diet, or a diet that severely restricts meat consumption, require a slightly expanded differential diagnosis. The challenge is to identify which patients require closer attention. This article lists questions to use to quickly assess for potential dietary drivers of clinical symptoms. In many cases, simple nutritional interventions, through diet and/or supplementation, can resolve or minimize problematic symptoms.","2012","2012 Dec","Gregory A Plotnikoff","Penny George Institute for Health and Healing, Minneapolis, USA."

Since the first observation of HCV-related cognitive deficits, 10 studies have been published that have evaluated neuropsychiatric performance in patients with HCV infection and different degrees of hepatic impairment. Unfortunately, these have often included patients with cirrhosis, patients who had acquired the infection through previous intravenous drug misuse, who had a history of relatively recent treatment with interferon, or were on psychoactive medication. In addition, different neuropsychological batteries and tests that explored different cognitive domains were used, which makes the results of the studies difficult to compare. Finally, limited information is available on the pathogenesis of HCV-related cognitive impairment. Cerebral and/or systemic inflammation may be important players but their potential role has not been substantiated by experimental data. The present review outlines the available evidence of the presence of cognitive impairment in patients with HCV infection, with a focus on the potential relationship with cerebral and/or systemic inflammation.","2011","2011 Aug 07","Marco Senzolo; Sami Schiff; Cristina Maria D'Aloiso; Chiara Crivellin; Evangelos Cholongitas; Patrizia Burra; Sara Montagnese",""

Given the heterogeneous nature of ME/CFS, it is likely that individuals with this illness experience these fatigue types differently in terms of severity and frequency. It is also possible that meaningful subgroups of patients exist that exhibit different patterns of the fatigue experience. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether individuals with ME/CFS can be classified in a meaningful way according to the different types of fatigue they experience. One hundred individuals with ME/CFS participated in the study. Individuals that met inclusion criteria were administered the Multiple Fatigue Types Questionnaire (MFTQ), a 5-factor instrument that distinguishes between different types of fatigue. A cluster analysis was used to classify patients into various clusters based on factor subscale scores. Using a 3-factor solution, individuals were classified according to illness severity (low, moderate, severe) across the different fatigue factors. However, a 5-cluster solution enabled participants with moderate to severe fatigue levels to fall into more differentiated clusters and demonstrate distinct fatigue state patterns. These results suggest that fatigue patterns of individuals with ME/CFS are heterogeneous, and that patients may be classified into meaningful subgroups.","2010","2010 Jan-Mar","Leonard A Jason; Aaron Boulton; Nicole S Porter; Tricia Jessen; Mary Gloria Njoku; Fred Friedberg","Center for Community Research, 990 W.
