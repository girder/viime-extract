"1","40668615","Dietary Tryptophan Augments Cancer-Associated Venous Thrombosis Mitigated by Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase 1 Inhibition.","Blood advances","","","Studies related to cardio-oncology remain of high priority, considering that venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer survivors is the second most common cause of death. While diet-derived metabolites are emerging contributors to VTE, the influence of specific dietary components, their underlying mechanisms, and means to mitigate cancer-associated VTE remain poorly investigated. This point is important as population studies point to a protein-rich diet associated with VTE. Leveraging a new colon cancer-VTE mouse model, we show that an imbalanced protein-rich diet augments venous thrombogenicity in tumor-bearing mice. Further probing showed that tryptophan in the diet induces a procoagulant venous wall characterized by the upregulation of tissue factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and von Willebrand Factor, and downregulation of thrombomodulin. Targeted metabolomics of sera from tumor-bearing mice revealed a pattern consistent with increased biogenesis of kynurenine (Kyn) and its suppressed catabolism, despite equal diet consumption in all groups. Kyn levels positively correlated with venous clots. Indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) is a key rate-limiting enzyme converting tryptophan to Kyn. Sera and the inferior vena cava of tumor-bearing mice showed greater IDO1 activity and protein level, respectively. A specific IDO1 inhibitor reduced serum levels of Kyn, restored the balance of pro- and anti-coagulant factors in the venous endothelium, and significantly suppressed venous thrombogenicity in tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, our results uncovered a prothrombotic effect of a protein or tryptophan-rich diet in a syngeneic colon cancer model, which is significantly attenuated by an IDO1 inhibitor.","2025","2025 Jul 16","Saran Lotfollahzadeh; Asha Jose; Xiaosheng Yang; Tanvi Bathla; Adam Lazowski; Isaac Hoekstra; Kashvi Sethuraman; Sowmya Potluri; Karlynn Dulberger; Jennifer La; Nathanael Fillmore; Maria Del Carmen Piqueras; Norman Lee; Howard J Cabral; Katya Ravid; Vipul Chitalia","Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University Medical Center, Roxbury, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.; VA Boston, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.; Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States."

However, the impact of common processing methods on its bioactive components and their associated biological activities remains unexplored. Understanding these shifts is crucial for maximizing its health benefits during consumption and industrial production. This study investigated how the bioactive ingredients in flowering Chinese cabbage were impacted by three typical processing methods: steaming, hot-air drying, and freeze-drying. Their methanol extracts for preventing the proliferation of colon cancer cell line HT29 were assessed. Component shifts and potential bioactive components responsible for the observed effects were found using untargeted metabolomics and network pharmacology analysis. The results show that, in contrast to the steamed group, both drying methods (hot-air drying and freeze-drying) demonstrated significant inhibition of HT29 cell proliferation at 1000 μg mL-1. Metabolomic analysis revealed that cinnamic acids and derivatives, flavonoids, and prenol lipids were the primary metabolite categories significantly altered by all three processing methods. Given the superior inhibitory activity of both drying groups, network pharmacology analysis pinpointed specific differential metabolites (sulforaphane, pentamidine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, and S-adenosylmethionine) enriched in both drying groups as potential key contributors to the anti-proliferative. This study provides clear evidence that processing methods significantly alter the bioactive component profile and associated anti-cancer potential of flowering Chinese cabbage. Drying processes, in particular, enhance specific bioactive metabolites linked to potent HT29 cell inhibition. These findings offer valuable insights for selecting processing methods to preserve or enhance the health-promoting properties of this vegetable. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.","2025","2025 Jul 10","Xuewei Xia; Guo Li; Wenshen Lin; Youhong Li; Xiaodan Chen; Qianmin Lin; Jiajing Zhen; Haichou Li; Supaluck Kraithong; Riming Huang; Xian Yang","College of Horticulture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food Quality and Safety, College of Food Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food Quality and Safety, College of Food Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.; Shenzhen Clinical College of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Shenzhen, China.; Shenzhen Clinical College of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Shenzhen, China.; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food Quality and Safety, College of Food Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food Quality and Safety, College of Food Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.; College of Horticulture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.; College of Mathematics and Informatics, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food Quality and Safety, College of Food Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food Quality and Safety, College of Food Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.; College of Horticulture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China."

In Experiment I, after the pseudo-sterile rat model was established, intragastric administration was performed. Explore the influence of different states of intestinal bacteria on rat organ coefficients, intestine bacteria, plasma metabolites, and so on. In Experiment II, the HT-29 cells of colon cancer were given to each group of drug-containing plasma for intervention to explore the intervention effect of HT-29-cell plasma produced under the influence of different states of intestinal bacteria. Pseudo-sterile conditions can affect the body weight, organ coefficients, and immune cell ratios of rats, leading to dysbiosis in various segments of their intestinal microbiota. After administering traditional Chinese medicine under pseudo-sterile conditions, the immune cell ratios in rats returned to normal, and the dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota improved. There were 271 differential metabolites in the plasma between the groups. Cellular experiments indicate that plasma containing drugs obtained under normal gut microbiota conditions can significantly inhibit the proliferation and migration of HT-29 cells (p < 0.01), while the inhibitory effect of plasma containing drugs obtained under dysbiotic gut microbiota conditions is reduced (p < 0.05). There is a bidirectional regulatory effect between the gut microbiota and the core medicinal pair. On one hand, dysbiosis weakens the efficacy of the medication. Dysbiosis can affect the blood components of the core medicinal pair. Compared to the drug-containing plasma produced under normal gut microbiota conditions, the drug-containing plasma produced under dysbiosis conditions has a reduced inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HT-29 cells. On the other hand, the drug repairs certain functions of the microbiota. After the drug enters the intestine, it exerts a positive regulatory effect on the dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in rats, partially improving the dysbiosis caused by antibiotics, restoring the balance of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8 + ratios in rats, and partially restoring the anticancer activity of drug-containing plasma. not applicable.","2025","2025 Jun 22","Xue-Yan Wang; Li-Jun Pan; Bing Yang; Yang Liu; Dong-Xin Tang","The First College of Clinical Medicine, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang Guizhou, 550005, China.; Department of Medical Affairs, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou, University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang Guizhou, 550001, China.; The First Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou, University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang Guizhou, 550001, China.; Scientific Research Section, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou, University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang Guizhou, 550001, China.; Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, South Dongqing Road, University Town, Huaxi District, Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, China. tangdongxin1204@sina.com."

Moench] has been given great attention as an excellent source of polyphenols that exhibit protective effects against multiple chronic disease models. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is strongly linked to the incidence of colon cancer and other intestinal chronic diseases. This study aimed to determine the ability of sorghum ethanolic phenolic extracts (SEPEs) to mitigate intestinal colitis and inflammation induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in a mice model. Forty C57BL/6 male mice were randomly assigned to one of the experimental groups: negative control, positive control (DSS only), and three groups given SEPEs containing (100 μg gallic acid eq/mL) from specialty brown sorghum accession SC84 grains (BSG) and leaves (BSL) from the same brown cultivar, and white sorghum grains (WSG). SEPEs-fed groups showed a significant reduction of the inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1-beta in the plasma and colon, colonic disease activity index values, and fecal hemoglobin content compared to the DSS group (p ≤ 0.001). Furthermore, SEPEs mitigated neutrophil infiltration by inhibiting myeloperoxidase activity in the colon and enhancing intestinal integrity by upregulation of tight junction proteins' production such as ZO-1 and claudin-7. Histopathological results showed an improvement in mucosal structure and colon morphology under SEPE uptake. BSL extract exhibited a better effect against DSS compared to BSG and WSG. Metabolomic and enrichment analyses of plasma showed that SEPEs effectively recovered the disrupted metabolomic profiling in UC via modulating key pathways associated with colitis-related inflammation and oxidative stress such as bile acids metabolism, amino acids metabolism, and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. SEPEs ameliorate colonic colitis and inflammation by suppressing proinflammatory cytokines production, neutrophil infiltration, and enhancement of intestinal integrity and functionality. Thus, specialty sorghum phenolics represent a potential alternative to mitigate colonic inflammation and colitis.","2025","2025 May-Jun","Ibtesam Sleem; Abby Rodriguez; Bingqi Chen; Ramasamy Perumal; Jaymi Peterson; Adina L Santana; Dmitriy Smolensky; Vermont P Dia","Department of Food Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Food Science and Technology, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.; Department of Food Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Food Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA.; Agricultural Research Center, Kansas State University, Hays, Kansas, USA.; Grain Quality and Structure Research Unit, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Manhattan, Kansas, USA.; Grain Science and Industry Department, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA.; Grain Quality and Structure Research Unit, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Manhattan, Kansas, USA.; Department of Food Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA."

To enhance the clinical management of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving malignant transformation in pre-cancerous adenomatous polyposis, as well as the identification of predictive biomarkers, is essential. In the present study, clinical samples were collected from rare patients with COAD and FAP, and metabolomic and proteomic analyses were performed to elucidate the mechanisms of canceration in FAP patients. The multi-omics analysis showed that cholesterol metabolism is highly activated in COAD tissue and identified 64 genes that are highly expressed in COAD and significantly correlated with prognosis. Improved in situ sequencing (IISS) identified ARV1 (ACAT related enzyme 2 required for viability 1) as a critical regulator of cholesterol metabolism. Finally, bioinformatics analysis using the HPA database showed that ARV1 expression is negatively correlated with COAD TNM stage; thus, indicating that ARV1 might play a role as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. Overall, cholesterol metabolism was found to be involved in colon adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis and ARV1 was identified as a key factor in the early stage of FAP transformation.","2025","2025 Jun 17","Yu-Cheng Zhu; Jun Zhang; Kun Liu; Ya-Bin Cheng; Wei Jiang","Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Zhongshan Hospital (Xiamen), Fudan University, Xiamen, China.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Zhongshan Hospital (Xiamen), Fudan University, Xiamen, China.; Department of Pathology, Zhongshan Hospital (Xiamen), Fudan University, Xiamen, China.; State Key Laboratory of Stress Biology and Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug Target Research, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Zhongshan Hospital (Xiamen), Fudan University, Xiamen, China.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."

Sociodemographic factors like sex and socioeconomic position (SEP) might modulate the relationship between lifestyle and colon cancer risk. Metabolomics offers potential to uncover biological mechanisms linking lifestyle and colon cancer. Lifestyle and untargeted metabolomic data were available from a nested case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), including 1,067 colon cancer cases and 1,067 controls matched on age, sex, study centre, and blood collection time. Serum samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The Healthy Lifestyle Index (HLI) score was derived from smoking habits, alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and diet. Penalised regression was applied in controls to derive metabolic signatures for the HLI and the lifestyle components. Associations of lifestyle factors and the metabolic signatures with colon cancer risk were estimated in conditional logistic regression models, overall and by sex and SEP. The HLI score was inversely associated with colon cancer risk, with an odds ratio (OR) per 1-standard deviation (SD) increment equal to 0.79; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.87. The metabolic signature of HLI, comprising 130 features, was moderately correlated with HLI (r = 0.59; 94% CI: 0.56, 0.61), and was inversely associated with colon cancer risk (OR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.95). After adjustment for the HLI score, the association of the metabolic signature of HLI and colon cancer risk was null (OR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.88, 1.13). Associations of lifestyle factors and the metabolic signature with colon cancer risk were consistently stronger for men than for women and did not differ by SEP. In this study across seven European countries, healthy lifestyle was inversely associated with colon cancer risk, with stronger associations in men than women and no differences across SEP. However, the serum metabolic signatures after adjustment for lifestyle factors were not found to be associated with colon cancer risk, suggesting that lifestyle impacts colon cancer through mechanisms not captured by the signatures.","2025","2025 Jun 16","Komodo Matta;

Since ulcerative colitis (UC), a significant risk factor for CAC, is rising in prevalence worldwide, an integrative approach is essential to identify potential triggers linking inflammation to cancer. In the present study, we investigated the role of the gut microbiome using Winnie mice, a UC-like model with a relevant missense mutation in the Muc2 gene. Upon transfer from a conventional (CONV) to a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) facility, Winnie mice exhibited a more severe colitis phenotype, and notably, spontaneous CAC as early as four weeks of age, which progressively worsened over time. In contrast, CONV Winnie developed only mild colitis but with no overt signs of tumorigenesis. Notably, when rederived into germ-free (GF) conditions, SPF Winnie mice were protected from colitis or colon tumor development, indicating an essential role for the gut microbiome in the initiation and progression of CAC in these mice. Using shotgun metagenomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics, we identified a distinct pro-inflammatory microbial and metabolic signature that potentially drives the transition from colitis to CAC. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), using either SPF Winnie or WT (Bl/6) donors into GF Winnie recipients, demonstrated that while colitis developed regardless of donor, only FMT from SPF Winnie donors resulted in CAC, revealing a microbiota-driven, host-specific susceptibility to tumorigenesis in Winnie mice. Our studies present a novel and relevant model of CAC, providing further evidence that the microbiome plays a key role in the pathogenesis of CAC, thereby challenging the concept of colon cancer as a strictly non-transmissible disease. This study reveals a distinct metagenomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic profile associated with tumorigenesis in a murine model of ulcerative colitis, highlighting the risks of specific intestinal dysbiosis in genetically predisposed subjects. Background and context: Colitis-associated colorectal cancer arises from complex host-environment interactions, including gut microbiome influences, driving chronic inflammation, with the intestinal lumen environment remaining a largely unexplored potential risk factor in cancer development.New findings: Winnie mice in specific pathogen-free conditions developed severe colitis, and a novel juvenile colon dysplasia and cancer, with gut microbiome changes driving colitis-associated cancer initiation and progression.Limitations: We identified a pro-inflammatory microbial/metabolic signature promoting colitis-to-CAC transition in Winnie mice, with FMT confirming microbiota-driven tumor susceptibility. However, further research is needed to pinpoint the key bacteria-metabolite-lipid combination driving CAC.Clinical research relevance: This newly characterized microbiota-metabolome-based model of CAC, challenges the dogma of cancer as a non-transmittable disease, providing a foundation for developing microbiota-based strategies for CAC prevention and treatment.Basic research relevance: Unlike genetic or chemically induced models, the Winnie mouse model uniquely serves as a dual model for spontaneous colitis and juvenile CAC, offering a fast, 100% penetrant phenotype that enhances reliability, accelerates research, and provides valuable insights into IBD and CAC.","2025","2025 Jun 03","Giulio Verna; Stefania De Santis; Bianca Islam; Eduardo M Sommella; Danilo Licastro; Liangliang Zhang; Fabiano De Almeida Celio; Fabrizio Merciai; Vicky Caponigro; Pietro Campiglia; Theresa T Pizarro; Marcello Chieppa; Fabio Cominelli",""

We tested the efficacy of the 15%Amylose/Soy/FO diet in preventing colitis-induced colorectal cancer using an azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate BALB/c mouse model. The 15%Amylose/Soy/FO diet significantly reduced colon tumor numbers compared to a Western diet and this was associated with a reduction in blood glucose, and a trend towards an increase in plasma β-hydroxybutyrate and an increase in liver fatty acid synthase, suggesting a systemic metabolic shift from glucose to fatty acids as an energy source. In addition, our CHO diet reduced proinflammatory cytokines, induced a marked change in the fecal microbiome, an increase in cecal and fecal acetate, and a reduction in interleukin-17A expressing cells in the colonic tumors of mice on the 15%Amylose/Soy/FO diet.

This study explores the therapeutic potential of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) in the treatment of colon CAC by assessing its effects on tumor growth and cellular metabolism in a colon CAC mouse model and CT26 colon cancer cells. Using NMR-based metabolomics and molecular biology techniques, we show that 3-HB significantly suppresses tumor growth in CAC mice, possibly through lactate accumulation in tumor tissue and modulation of key metabolic pathways. Notably, this treatment leads to a paradoxical increase in intracellular lactate levels within tumor cells, accompanied by a decrease in extracellular lactate in the tumor microenvironment, due to 3-HB competing with lactate for monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). Furthermore, 3-HB increases oxidative stress and induces apoptosis in CT26 cells, as evidenced by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase-3 activation. Mechanistically, 3-HB competes with lactate for monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), resulting in intracellular lactate accumulation, acidification, and subsequent tumor suppression. These findings highlight the potential of 3-HB as a viable candidate for CAC therapy and provide new insights into metabolic reprogramming strategies in cancer treatment.","2025","2025 Jul 04","Xu Qiu; Wenfang Wu; Zhiyun Zou; Caihua Huang; Donghai Lin","Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China.; Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China.; Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China.; Research and Communication Center of Exercise and Health, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen 361024, China.; Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China."

Conversely, the consumption of fruits and vegetables offers protective effects, potentially modulating multiple carcinogenesis-related pathways. Here, we investigated the metabolomic response to apiaceous and cruciferous vegetable consumption in relation to concomitant PhIP consumption. In a randomized crossover design, 25 participants underwent four phases with four different test meals at the end of each phase. Test meals were well-done hamburger (Control), Control plus cruciferous vegetables (Cru), Control plus apiaceous vegetables (Api), and Control plus combined vegetable types (Cru + Api). Urine samples were subjected to metabolomics analysis using UPLC-MS/MS system. A total of 660 metabolites were identified. The Cru and Api meals showed distinct metabolite profiles, and the Cru + Api meal induced 133 metabolite changes compared to Control.

As effector T cells have high energy demands, tumor metabolism can contribute to T-cell dysfunction and exhaustion. In this study, we determined hypoxia in spleen and tumor tissue from tumor-bearing C57BL/6J mice using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), histology and flow cytometry. Next, CD8+ T cells isolated from C57BL6J mice or P14+ mice were transduced with Thy1.1 (Control) or Thy1.1-Myoglobin (Mb) packaged retrovirus. Expression of Mb was confirmed with RT-PCR and western blot. Cellular metabolism was determined by flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, Seahorse, metabolomics and luminescence assays. Mb expressing or control P14+ or OT-I+ T cells were transferred in B16F10-gp33 or MC38-ova tumor-bearing mice respectively and analyzed using flow cytometry and histology. B16F10-gp33 tumor-bearing mice were additionally treated with anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitor. Here we demonstrate that expression of the oxygen-binding protein myoglobin in T cells can boost their mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolic functions. Metabolites and tricarboxylic acid compounds were highly increased in the presence of myoglobin (Mb), which was associated with increased ATP levels. Mb-expressing T cells exhibited low expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α after activation and during infiltration into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Accordingly, Mb expression increased effector T-cell function against tumor cells in vitro with concomitant reductions in superoxide levels. Following adoptive transfer into tumor-bearing mice, Mb expression facilitated increased infiltration into the TME. Although T cells expressing Mb exhibited increased expression of effector cytokines, PD-1 was still detected and targetable by anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, which in combination with transfer of Mb-expressing T cells demonstrated maximal efficacy in delaying tumor growth. Taken together, we show that expression of Mb in T cells can increase their metabolism, infiltration into the tumor tissue, and effector function against cancer cells.","2025","2025 Jun 03","Julia Werner; Haifeng C Xu; Georgios Theodorakis; Ichiro Katahira; Mitrajit Ghosh; Michal Gorzkiewicz; Luisa de Sousa Santos; Ann Kathrin Bergmann; Max Anstötz; Anne Busch; Diran Herebian; Sascha Dietrich; Carsten Berndt; Ertan Mayatepek; Aleksandra A Pandyra; Dirk Brenner; Philipp A Lang","Department of Molecular Medicine II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Molecular Medicine II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Molecular Medicine II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Molecular Medicine II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Molecular Medicine II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Molecular Medicine II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of General Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.; Department of Molecular Medicine II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Core Facility for Electron Microscopy, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Institut for Anatomie II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Düsseldorf, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of General Pediatrics, Neonatology and Pediatric Cardiology, Medical Faculty, University Hospital Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital of Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Düsseldorf, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of General Pediatrics, Neonatology and Pediatric Cardiology, Medical Faculty, University Hospital Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Bonn-Cologne, Bonn, Germany.; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Experimental and Molecular Immunology, Department of Infection and Immunity, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.; Immunology & Genetics, Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB), University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.; Odense Research Center for Anaphylaxis (ORCA), Department of Dermatology and Allergy Center, Odense University Hospital, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.; Department of Molecular Medicine II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany langp@uni-duesseldorf.de."

Metabolomics analysis was performed to indicate the differences of metabolites. Discrimination model and diagnostic model were constructed using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, and differential metabolites were screened, then receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of these models. Melatonin (MLT), indole propionic, and skatole were screened as the common differential metabolites shared by four types of cancer, indicating that the intestinal microbial metabolic pathway of tryptophan plays a key role in the occurrence and development of malignant tumors. The area under the curve values for the potential candidate biomarker predictors in univariate analysis ranged from 0.771 to 0.989, and in multivariate analysis ranged from 0.985 to 1.00. The sensitivity and specificity of the multivariable model were 94.7-100 and 96.4-100%, respectively. These biomarkers also had good performance in discriminating different pairs of cancer.

Balb/c mice were assigned into control, model, low-dose BXD(BXD-L), and high-dose BXD(BXD-H) groups. Except the control group, the other groups were subcutaneously injected with CT26-Luc cells for the modeling of colon cancer, which was followed by the intervention with BXD. Small animal live imaging was employed to monitor tumor growth, and the tumor volume and weight were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining was used to observe the pathological changes in mouse tumors. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect Ki67 expression in tumors. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were used to detect the infiltration and number changes of CD3~+/CD8~+ T cells in the tumor tissue. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) was employed to measure the levels of interferon-gamma(IFN-γ) and interleukin-2(IL-2) in tumors. Targeted metabolomics was employed to measure the level of tryptophan(Trp) in the serum, and the Trp content in the tumor tissue was measured. Western blot and RT-qPCR were employed to determine the protein and mRNA levels, respectively, of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1(IDO1), MYC proto-oncogene, and solute carrier family 7 member 5(SLC7A5) in the tumor tissue. Additionally, a co-culture model with CT26 cells and CD8~+ T cells was established in vitro and treated with the BXD-containing serum. The cell counting kit-8(CCK-8) assay was used to examine the viability of CT26 cells. The content of Trp in CT26 cells and CD8~+ T cells, as well as the secretion of IFN-γ and IL-2 by CD8~+ T cells, was measured. RT-qPCR was used to determine the mRNA levels of MYC and SLC7A5 in CT26 cells. The results showed that BXD significantly inhibited the tumor growth, reduced the tumor weight, and decreased the tumor volume in the model mice. In addition, the model mice showed sparse arrangement of tumor cells, varying degrees of patchy necrosis, and downregulated expression of Ki67 in the tumor tissue. BXD elevated the levels of IFN-γ and IL-2 in the tumor tissue, while upregulating the ratio of CD3~+/CD8~+ T cells and lowering the levels of Trp, IDO1, MYC, and SLC7A5. The co-culture experiment showed that BXD-containing serum reduced Trp uptake by CT26 cells, increased Trp content in CD8~+T cells, enhanced IL-2 and IFN-γ secretion of CD8~+T cells, and down-regulated the mRNA levels of MYC and SLC7A5 in CT26 cells. In summary, BXD can inhibit the MYC/SLC7A5 pathway to reshape Trp metabolism and adjust Trp uptake by CD8~+ T cells to enhance the cytotoxicity, thereby inhibiting the development of colon cancer.","2025","2025 Mar","Yi-Fang Jiang; Yu-Qing Huang; Heng-Zhou Lai; Xue-Ke Li; Liu-Yi Long; Feng-Ming You; Qi-Xuan Kuang","Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulating Metabolic Diseases Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province,Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 610075, China.; Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulating Metabolic Diseases Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province,Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 610075, China.; Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulating Metabolic Diseases Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province,Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 610075, China.; Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulating Metabolic Diseases Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province,Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 610075, China.; Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 610075, China.; Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulating Metabolic Diseases Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province,Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 610075, China Cancer Institute, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 610072, China.; Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulating Metabolic Diseases Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province,Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 610075, China."

Numerous studies have shown the advantageous pharmacological impacts of polysaccharides, including their effectiveness against cancer. A halophilic bacterial strain obtained from coastal sediments produced exopolysaccharides (EPS). The strain was morphologically recognized and further confirmed as Bacillus cereus strain MSS1 using 16S rDNA analysis, with accession number OR133726. The heteropolysaccharides were purified and fractionated with a DEAE-cellulose column, and the preliminary chemical analysis of the most potent fraction (EPSMSS1) indicated that the four different monosaccharides were mannuronic acid, xylose, fructose, and glucuronic acid, with a molar ratio of 1:1:2:0.5, respectively. The highest production was 12.76 g/l using a Box-Behnken design. It showed antibacterial activity, antioxidant activity, and antibiofilm activity. The 3D architecture of the EPSMSS1 of Bacillus cereus strain MSS1 is being described, predicted, and aligned against other bacterial species. These studies offer valuable insights into optimizing efficiency. Therefore, the EPSMSS1 fraction was shown to have anticancer activity and significant anticancer activities in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 20.1 µg/ml. Subsequently, various apoptotic markers, such as cytochrome c, BAX, BCl2, and the BAX/BCL2 ratio, were assessed. Our findings demonstrate that EPSMSS1 triggers the activation of apoptotic protein BAX, enhances the generation of cytochrome c, reduces the expression of antiapoptotic protein BCl2, and distorts the BAX/BCL2 ratio in EPSMSS1-treated HCT-116 cells relative to untreated cells. The anticancer efficacy of EPSMSS1 was verified through the assessment of cell cycle progression using flow cytometry. It has been found that EPSMSS1 pauses the cell cycle in the G1/S phase, causing apoptosis. The main motivation behind this study was EPSMSS1, an innovative marine polysaccharide with remarkable biological activity, especially anti-cancer properties.","2025","2025 May 05","Sayeda Abdelrazek Abdelhamid; Sahar S Mohamed; Mostafa M Abo Elsoud; Manal S Selim; Marwa M Mounier; Ashraf Eltaher; Sameh Magdeldin; Mohamed Ali; Mohamed E El Awady","Microbial Biotechnology Department, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt. sayeda.abdelrazek@yahoo.com.; Microbial Biotechnology Department, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt.; Microbial Biotechnology Department, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt.; Microbial Biotechnology Department, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt.; Pharmacognosy Department, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt.; Proteomics and Metabolomics Research Program, Research Department, Basic Research Unit, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357, Cairo, 11441, Egypt.; Proteomics and Metabolomics Research Program, Research Department, Basic Research Unit, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357, Cairo, 11441, Egypt.; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, 41522, Egypt.; Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Zagazig University, Zagazig, 44519, Egypt.; Microbial Biotechnology Department, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt."

Modern research highlights Formononetin (FN) for its significant anti-inflammatory and extensively studied anti-cancer properties; however, its precise mechanisms, particularly in CAC, remain unclear and warrant further investigation. To investigate the anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activity of FN and its effect on CAC, using biological fluid metabolomics to identify potential diagnostic markers for CAC. The MTT assay determined the survival rate of FN on murine RAW264.7 cells and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of FN on murine CT-26 and human HCT116 cells IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels were detected by ELISA. Western blotting was used to analyze autophagic and apoptotic pathways. Utilizing an in vivo mouse model of colitis, the anti-inflammatory activity of FN was assessed by monitoring relevant indicators such as body weight, DAI score, and colon index. And an in vitro mouse colon cancer model was used to observe FN's anti-tumor activity by measuring tumor volume, size, and inhibition rate. Metabolomics analyzed differential serum metabolites and lipid metabolic pathways. Intestinal flora in mice was also analyzed. FN can inhibit the activation of the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathways in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells, thereby exerting its anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, FN significantly enhanced the colon length and DAI score in mice, notably suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway, leading to an improvement in DSS-induced colitis. FN significantly inhibited CT-26 and HCT116 cell growth, reduced tumor growth rate, improved pathological damage in CAC mice, and inhibited inflammatory factor production, enhancing intestinal mucosa protection. FN promoted apoptosis of colon cancer cells by increasing autophagy proteins (LC3, Beclin-1) and apoptosis proteins (CL-Caspase3, Bax), while reducing Bcl-2 expression. Metabolomics identified 34 differential metabolites, including glycerophospholipids and fatty acids, showing anti-tumor effects by regulating lipid metabolism. FN reduced IGF-1, ACLY, A-CoA, FAS, HSL, ATGL, and FFA levels, and increased GSK-3 levels (p < 0.01). FN also inhibited the expression of P-mTOR, Rictor, P-Akt, ACLY, PDE3B, P-PKA, and P-HSL (p < 0.01). FN significantly inhibits colon cancer cell growth and exerts anti-CAC effects by activating autophagy and apoptosis pathways and regulating lipid metabolism. This study is the first to comprehensively integrate metabolomics, intestinal flora analysis, and molecular mechanisms to unveil FN's multifaceted role in CAC treatment, offering novel insights into its therapeutic application.","2025","2025 Jul","Mingxiu Liu; Canjiao Yang; Xingju Peng; Suman Zheng; Hongping He; Weiguang Wang; Yanping Li","College of Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, 650500, China.; College of Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, 650500, China.; College of Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, 650500, China.; College of Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, 650500, China.; College of Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, 650500, China.; Key Laboratory of Chemistry in Ethnic Medicinal Resources, State Ethnic Affairs Commission and Ministry of Education, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming 650031, China.; College of Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, 650500, China.

However, the effect of exogenous asparagine on colorectal cancer (CRC) growth in men and women remains unclear. This study aims to understand the relationship between exogenous asparagine supplementation and 17β-estradiol levels and to elucidate mechanisms underlying sex-dependent signaling during CRC development. We administered asparagine intraperitoneally to tumor-bearing male and female immunodeficient Rag2/Il2RG (R2G2) mice. Asparagine supplementation caused a significant increase in tumor asparagine levels in both the tumor-bearing male and female R2G2 mice but increased serum estradiol levels and suppressed tumor growth in female R2G2 mice only. Additionally, we combined transcriptome, metabolome, and immunochemical analyses, and found that intraperitoneal asparagine treatment induced sex-dependent intra-tumoral metabolic changes to asparagine, aspartate, glutamine and glutamate levels. We observed that in females, exogenous asparagine exerts a negative feed-back effect on de novo asparagine synthesis and is associated with the activation of a sub-population of macrophages that may secrete 17β-estradiol via an aromatase or cytochrome P450 family 19 (CYP19)-dependent mechanism. Conversely, in male mice, asparagine treatment augments tumor growth, and is related to decreased numbers of macrophages, and a reduction in CYP19-mediated 17β-estradiol secretion .

Over the years, a growing number of studies have highlighted the therapeutic potential of ligands targeting these receptors, however, the potential role of imidazoline I2 receptor agonists in cancer treatment has not been thoroughly investigated. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer worldwide. The complexity of CRC necessitates individualized approaches. One promising area of research within CRC therapy is the regulation of autophagy. Recent studies have explored the relationship between autophagy and cancer progression, revealing that autophagy modulation could be a potential strategy for CRC treatment. However, the mechanisms underlying autophagy regulation remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the imidazoline I2 receptor agonist, namely 2-(2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline hydrochloride (2-BFI), on colorectal cancer cells, HT-29 and HCT-116 cell lines, particularly its impact when co-incubated with the autophagy inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The results showed that 2-BFI synergistically increased the cytotoxic effect of HCQ by inducing oxidative stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, our investigation indicated impairment autophagic influx in colon cancer cells treated by 2-BFI. The comprehensive metabolomic analysis revealed significant alterations in key metabolic pathways including MAO activity, oxidative stress responses, energy-related metabolites and amino acids metabolism. Altogether, these findings demonstrate potential a new therapeutic strategy based on autophagy regulation and the selective induction of oxidative stress in colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, this study provides a foundation for further investigation into the therapeutic potential of imidazoline receptor agonists in cancer therapy.","2025","2025 Jun 05","Szymon Kowalski; Paweł Wityk; Joanna Raczak-Gutknecht; Anna Olszewska; Michał Żmijewski; Ivan Kocić","Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Gdańsk, Gdańsk, Poland.

Here we report that tirzepatide (TZP), a novel polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GIPR/GLP-1R) agonist for the treatment of diabetes, has a role in attenuating CRC growth. TZP significantly inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation promoted apoptosis in vitro and induced durable tumor regression in vivo under hyperglycemic and nonhyperglycemic conditions across multiple murine cancer models. As glucose metabolism is known to critically regulate colon cancer progression, spatial metabolomics results revealed that glucose metabolites are robustly reduced in the colon cancer regions of the TZP-treated mice. TZP inhibited glucose uptake and destabilized hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) with reduced expression and activity of the rate-limiting enzymes 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) and phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1). These effects contributed to the downregulation of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. TZP also delayed tumor development in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model accompanied by HIF-1α mediated PFKFB3-PFK-1 inhibition. Therefore, the study provides strong evidence that glycolysis-blocking TZP, besides its application in treating type 2 diabetes, has the potential for preclinical studies as a therapy for colorectal cancer used either as monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer therapies.","2025","2025 May","Yikai Zhang; Yi Xie; Shenglong Xia; Xinnuo Ge; Jiaying Li; Fang Liu; Fan Jia; Shengyao Wang; Qiao Zhou; Menghan Gao; Weihuan Fang; Chao Zheng","Department of Endocrinology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, P.

Indole-based microbial metabolite mimics Felix Kopp Kortagere 6 (FKK6), which is a ligand and agonist of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), was recently demonstrated to have PXR-dependent anti-inflammatory and protective effects in a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced acute colitis. Here, we examined the therapeutic potential of FKK6 in a mouse model (C57BL/6 FVB humanized PXR mice) of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) induced by azoxymethane and DSS. FKK6 (2 mg/kg) displayed substantial antitumor activity, as revealed by reduced size and number of colon tumors, improved colon histopathology, and decreased expression of tumor markers (c-MYC, β-catenin, Ki-67, and cyclin D) in the colon. In addition, we carried out a chronic toxicity (30 days) assessment of FKK6 (1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) in C57BL/6 mice. Histological examination of tissues, biochemical blood analyses, and immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 and γ-H2AX showed no difference between FKK6-treated and control mice. Comparative metabolomic analyses in mice exposed for 5 days to DSS and administered with FKK6 (0.4 mg/kg) revealed no significant effects on several classes of metabolites in the mouse fecal metabolome. Ames and micronucleus tests showed no genotoxic and mutagenic potential of FKK6 in vitro. In conclusion, anticancer effects of FKK6 in azoxymethane/DSS-induced CAC, together with FKK6 safety data from in vitro tests and in vivo chronic toxicity study, and comparative metabolomic study, are supportive of the potential therapeutic use of FKK6 in the treatment of CAC. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Microbial metabolite mimicry proposes that chemical mimics of microbial metabolites that serve to protect hosts against aberrant inflammation in the gut could serve as a new paradigm for the development of drugs targeting inflammatory bowel disease if, like the parent metabolite, is devoid of toxicity but more potent against the microbial metabolite receptor. We identified a chemical mimic of Felix Kopp Kortagere 6, and we propose that Felix Kopp Kortagere 6 is devoid of toxicity yet significantly reduces tumor formation in an azoxymethane-dextran sodium sulfate model of murine colitis-induced colon cancer.","2025","2025 Feb","Lucia Sládeková; Hao Li; Vera M DesMarais; Amanda P Beck; Hillary Guzik; Barbora Vyhlídalová; Haiwei Gu; Sridhar Mani; Zdenek Dvořák","Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, Palacký University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.; Department of Medicine and Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.; Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York; Analytical Imaging Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.; Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.; Analytical Imaging Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, Palacký University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.; Arizona Metabolomics Laboratory, College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University, Phoenix, Arizona.; Department of Medicine and Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, Palacký University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.

However, the antitumor effects of Ethoxychelerythrine (Eth) have not been previously reported. Cell viability, colony formation, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis, intracellular and reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) levels of Eth against SW480 cells were evaluated. Subcutaneously transplanted SW480 cells model was used to determine the effect of Eth on tumor growth in vivo. Inflammation levels, angiogenic factors, pathological observations, quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), quantitative proteomics, metabolite profiles and western blotting were conducted. It found that Eth significantly inhibited the proliferation of SW480 and HT29 cells in vitro, with stronger inhibitory activity observed against SW480 cells. Therefore, subsequent studies focused on SW480 cells. In vitro, we observed that Eth arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, decreased MMP levels, elevated cellular ROS levels, and induced mitochondrial apoptosis. In vitro, Eth significantly inhibited tumor proliferation and metastasis, and regulated the molecule levels of angiogenesis and inflammatory factors in serum, as well as apoptotic protein in tumor tissues. The serum proteomic revealed that the differential proteins were primarily involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, including laminin β1 (Lamb1), and type I collagen (Col1a1). Metabolomics showed that many abnormal levels of metabolites regulated by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were obviously reversed towards normal levels after Eth intervention. The correlation analysis between the two-omics revealed that different proteins in the PI3K/AKT pathway, particularly lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) and glutathione synthetase (GSS), can interact with most of different metabolites. In summary, Eth exerts anti-tumour effects by inhibiting the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which in turn activates mitochondrial apoptosis. Eth may be considered in the development of drugs for relieving colon cancer patients in the future.","2025","2025 Feb 24","Yaqin Meng; Yanpo Si; Tao Guo; Weiwei Zhao; Liping Zhang; Ya Wang; Lianping Wang; Ke Sun; Shuying Feng","Department of Pharmacy, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, NO 156 JinshuiEast Road, Zhengzhou, 450046, China.; School of Life Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou, 730050, China.; Department of Pharmacy, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, NO 156 JinshuiEast Road, Zhengzhou, 450046, China.; Department of Pharmacy, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, NO 156 JinshuiEast Road, Zhengzhou, 450046, China. gt010010@hactcm.edu.cn.; Department of Integrated Therapy, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, No 270 Dong'An Road, Shanghai, 200032, China. sunbrightzww@126.com.; Department of Pharmacy, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, NO 156 JinshuiEast Road, Zhengzhou, 450046, China.; School of Life Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou, 730050, China.; Lanzhou Foci Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Lanzhou, 730050, China.; Lanzhou Foci Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Lanzhou, 730050, China.; Medical College, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, NO 156 JinshuiEast Road, Zhengzhou, 450046, China. fsy@hactcm.edu.cn."

The aim of this study was to observe and understand the metabolic changes in CRC through targeted metabolomics. Samples collected from 58 CRC patients and 35 healthy individuals have been analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), targeting two classes of metabolites: amino acids and acylcarnitines. Statistical analysis revealed 26 significantly modified (p-value < 0.01; |FC| > 1.2) metabolites in CRC patients compared to the control group and 22 between colon cancer and control, whereas 8 metabolites differed only significantly between rectal cancer and healthy patients. Some of these significantly modified metabolites characterize cancer-specific adaptations, such as increased energy demand, increased tumor invasiveness, capabilities to promote amino acid synthesis, and tumor resistance against acute immune response. Moreover, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that a set of two acylcarnitines (C6DC and C4-OH) can differentiate between CRC patients and healthy individuals with a high degree of confidence (AUC 0.837). By implementing a metabolomics approach targeting amino acids and acylcarnitines, several metabolic alterations induced by CRC have been highlighted. Even though these modifications are not specific enough to act as disease markers, they might prove useful for evaluating patient status.","2025","2025 Jan 27","Lucreția Avram; Dana Crișan; Radu-Cristian Moldovan; Luisa-Gabriela Bogos; Cristina-Adela Iuga; David Andraș; Sorin Crișan; Constantin Bodolea; Andrada Nemeş; Valer Donca","Geriatrics-Gerontology, Department 5-Medical Specialties, Faculty of Medicine, ""Iuliu Haţieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca, 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Department of Internal Medicine, 5th Medical Clinic, Faculty of Medicine, ""Iuliu Hațieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca, 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Department of Personalized Medicine and Rare Diseases, Institute of Biomedical Research-MedFuture, ""Iuliu Hațieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca, 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Department of Personalized Medicine and Rare Diseases, Institute of Biomedical Research-MedFuture, ""Iuliu Hațieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca, 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Department of Personalized Medicine and Rare Diseases, Institute of Biomedical Research-MedFuture, ""Iuliu Hațieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca, 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, Faculty of Pharmacy, ""Iuliu Haţieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; 1st Surgical Clinic, Department of General Surgery, ""Iuliu Haţieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 400012 Cluj Napoca, Romania.; Department of Internal Medicine, 5th Medical Clinic, Faculty of Medicine, ""Iuliu Hațieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca, 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Intensive Care Unit Department, ""Iuliu Haţieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Intensive Care Unit Department, ""Iuliu Haţieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Geriatrics-Gerontology, Department 5-Medical Specialties, Faculty of Medicine, ""Iuliu Haţieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca, 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania."

M. Tenacissima extract is now available in China under the brand name ""Xiao Ai Ping"" and is commonly used in conjunction with chemotherapy to treat a number of diseases, including liver cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. The research focused on the potential mechanisms contributing to the in vivo therapeutic effects on breast cancer using the ethyl acetate portion of M. tenacissima extract (EMTE), demonstrating significant promise in treating lung cancer in our initial experiments. We examined the impact of EMTE on the growth of breast cancer through experiments on homoplastic breast cancer mice. Moreover, we utilized UPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis to identify the components of EMTE and anticipate its potential therapeutic targets. Through network pharmacology, we predicted the potential targets and pathways affected by EMTE in relation to breast cancer. Additionally, we analysed the metabolic changes induced by EMTE during its anti-breast cancer effects. The MAPK pathway was identified as the most likely route by which EMTE could influence breast cancer through network pharmacological enrichment of pathways. Research on animals showed that EMTE could successfully inhibit the development of breast tumours in the homoplastic breast cancer mouse model. We observed that EMTE treatment affected the metabolism of breast cancer mice, particularly in the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, linoleic acid metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism. These metabolic alterations may have contributed to the effects of glycolysis, tumour immune evasion, and pyrimidine de novo synthesis. Based on the results of network pharmacological and metabolomic analysis, we postulate that the inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway may have played a role in promoting apoptosis in breast cancer cells and confirmed relevant protein expression of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway with Western blotting in tumour tissue of homoplastic breast cancer mice.","2025","2025 Mar 13","Xinxin Su; Runtian Li; Zhiguang Zhang; Lin Lu; Siqi Wang; Tongxiang Liu","School of Pharmacy, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China; Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine (Minzu University of China), Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100081, China.; School of Pharmacy, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China; Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine (Minzu University of China), Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100081, China.; School of Pharmacy, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China; Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine (Minzu University of China), Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100081, China.; School of Pharmacy, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China; Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine (Minzu University of China), Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100081, China.; School of Pharmacy, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China; Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine (Minzu University of China), Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100081, China.; School of Pharmacy, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China; Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine (Minzu University of China), Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100081, China.

In addition, colon cancer patients often experience sleep deprivation due to factors such as cancer pain and side effects of treatment. The occurrence of liver metastases is an important factor in the mortality of colon cancer patients. However, the relationship between sleep deprivation and liver metastases from colon cancer has not been elucidated. A sleep deprivation liver metastasis model was constructed to evaluate the effect of sleep deprivation on liver metastasis of colon cancer. Subsequently, mice feces were collected for untargeted metabolomics to screen and identify the key mediator, Kynurenic acid (KynA). Furthermore, HILPDA was screened by transcriptomics, and its potential mechanism was explored through ChIP, co-IP, ubiquitination experiments, phenotyping experiments, etc. RESULTS: Sleep deprivation promotes liver metastases in colon cancer. Functionally, sleep deprivation aggravates lipid accumulation and decreases the production of the microbiota metabolite KynA. In contrast, KynA inhibited colon cancer progression in vitro. In vivo, KynA supplementation reversed the promoting effects of sleep deprivation on liver metastases from colon cancer. Mechanistically, KynA downregulates the expression of P4HA2 to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α, which leads to a decrease in the transcription of HILPDA, and ultimately leads to an increase in lipolysis of colon cancer cells. Our findings reveal that sleep deprivation impairs intracellular lipolysis by KynA, leading to lipid droplets accumulation in colon cancer cells. This process ultimately promotes colon cancer liver metastasis. This suggests a promising strategy for colon cancer treatment.","2025","2025 Mar","Zuojie Peng; Jia Song; Wenzhong Zhu; Haijun Bao; Yuan Hu; Yongping Shi; Xukai Cheng; Mi Jiang; Feifei Fang; Jinhuang Chen; Xiaogang Shu","Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Jiefang Road No.1277, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, China.; Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Jiefang Road No.1277, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, China.; Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Jiefang Road No.1277, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, China.; Department of Emergency Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Jiefang Road No.1277, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, China.; Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Jiefang Road No.1277, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, China.; Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Jiefang Road No.1277, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, China.; Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Jiefang Road No.1277, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, China.; Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Jiefang Road No.1277, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, China.; Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Jiefang Road No.1277, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, China.; Department of Emergency Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Jiefang Road No.1277, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, China.

BALB/c mice inoculated with C26 colon cancer cells were treated with paclitaxel (PTX, 10 mg/kg) and ACT (100 mg/kg) alone or in combination for 21 days. Fatigue-associated behaviors, tumor inhibition rate, and skeletal muscle morphology assessed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and electron microscopy were evaluated. Finally, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was employed to investigate alterations in the plasma metabolic profile of tumor-bearing mice with CRF in response to ACT treatment, and the affinity between metabolite-associated proteins and ACT was verified by Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. Our study demonstrated the presence of CRF in the colon cancer mouse model, with the severity of fatigue increasing alongside tumor growth. Administration of ACT ameliorated both tumor burden and PTX-induced muscle fatigue-like behavior. LC/MS analysis identified a panel of differentially regulated metabolites, including trans-aconitine, citric acid, 3-coumaric acid, ephedrine, thymine, cytosine, indole-3-acetic acid, and pantothenol-9. These metabolites were primarily enriched in pathways associated with valine biosynthesis, tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and biosynthesis of pyridine alkaloids. Furthermore, several key enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP19A1, CYP2E1, TNF, BCL-2, RYR2, and ATP2A1, were identified as potential targets underlying the anti-CRF effects of ACT.

Results suggest that: 1) MAE is more efficient than maceration in recovering metabolites from plant biomass based on measurements of total phenolic content, radical scavenging activity, and bioactivity of extracts based on in vitro cytotoxicity. 2) Only T. nilotica extracts were found to be bioactive based on cytotoxicity measurements. 3) Cancer cell lines displayed differential sensitivity to T. nilotica crude extracts, with breast cancer cells being the most sensitive and lung cancer cells being the least sensitive. 4) Solid-phase fractionation of T. nilotica crude extract using different percentages of methanol resulted in several fractions that were 100-fold more cytotoxic compared to the crude unfractionated extract. The 30% and 70% methanol fractions exhibited the highest cytotoxicity towards breast and colon cancer cell lines, respectively. 5) Untargeted metabolomics using UHPLC-Q-ToF-MS of T. nilotica crude extracts revealed 909 molecular features, of which only 327 were annotated using MS/MS fragmentation. The results suggest that T. nilotica extracts have potential as anti-cancer agents and that MAE is an efficient method for extracting phytochemicals from plant biomass. The study also revealed that cancer cell lines exhibited differential sensitivity to the extracts and that solid-phase fractionation of crude extract using different percentages of methanol can yield fractions that are more cytotoxic than the crude extract.","2025","2025","Maryam Al Kaabi; Nancy A ElNaker; Nila Jan; Michael A Ochsenkühn; Shady A Amin; Lina F Yousef; Ahmed F Yousef","Department of Chemistry, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.; Department of Chemistry, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.; Department of Chemistry, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.; Marine Microbiomics Lab, New York University Abu Dhabi, Saadiyat Island, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.; Marine Microbiomics Lab, New York University Abu Dhabi, Saadiyat Island, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.; Department of Chemistry, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.; Department of Biological Sciences, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.; Center for Membranes and Advanced Water Technology (CMAT), Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.; Center for Biotechnology (BTC), Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates."

Here, the research aims to reveal the association between the expression of FBXW7 and clinical variables and to investigate the molecular mechanism by which FBXW7 plays a critical role in the development of CRC. The clinical importance of FBXW7 in CRC was determined by immunohistochemistry. Non-targeted metabolomics was utilized to explore the role of FBXW7 in the metabolic regulation of CRC. Low expression of FBXW7 was associated with poor prognosis in individuals with CRC, both at the mRNA and protein levels. FBXW7 over-expression inhibited CRC cell growth, colony formation, migration, and invasion. Non-targeted metabolomics unveiled that FBXW7 over-expression directly caused the deprivation of arginine which led to downmodulation of mTOR signaling pathway; meanwhile, FBXW7-related metabolites were primarily concentrated in the mTOR signaling pathway. In summary, the research identified a novel mechanism of action of FBXW7 in CRC. The research findings provide a theoretical foundation for the prognostic prediction and therapeutic planning of CRC based on metabolic reprogramming.","2025","2025","Qing Li; Yan Li; Tong Zhou; Yong Zhang; Huiyu Li; Fajia Yuan; Yanghui Bi","Center of Gene Sequencing, Shanxi Bethune Hospital, Shanxi Academy of Medical Sciences, Tongji Shanxi Hospital, Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, P.

Fusobacterium nucleatum and its metabolites are effective biological targets for colon cancer promotion. Probiotics such as Bifidobacterium can block the occurrence and development of CRC by regulating the host intestinal mucosal immunity, eliminating carcinogens, and interfering with tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. We selected six Bifidobacterium species to explore the inhibitory effect of their cell-free supernatant (CFS) on Fusobacterium nucleatum, and screened the best functional strain Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) to explore its intervention effect on Fnevs infection of CRC cells. In the genus Bifidobacterium, B. longum-CFS can effectively inhibit the growth and membrane formation of Fusobacterium nucleatum. The metabolites of B. longum can inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of Fnevs-infected CRC cells. However, the transcriptomic analysis of Fnevs-infected CRC cells treated with Bl-CFS revealed that Bl-CFS exerted inhibitory effects on the expression of specific oncogenes (e.g., Myc, IL16, KCNN2, ACSBG1, Pum1, MET, NR5A2), while simultaneously promoting the expression of other oncogenes. This modulation potentially enhances the proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stemness properties and other characteristics associated with CRC cells. Metabolomics also showed that Bl-CFS altered organic acid and lipid metabolism in Fnevs-infected CRC cells, and switched energy supply from aerobic glucose metabolism (TCA cycle) to anaerobic glycolysis, which increased the malignancy potential of CRC cells. The observed outcome may be attributed to the presence of both probiotics and toxic substances in the metabolites derived from Bifidobacterium longum. Therefore, this study concludes that the anti-colorectal cancer (CRC) effect of natural metabolites derived from Bifidobacterium longum is limited. Future investigations should focus on refining these natural substances and optimizing their composition ratios to extract their essence while eliminating impurities, thereby obtaining anticancer biologics with exceptional and consistent efficacy.","2025","2025 Feb 01","Jingyu Xu; Xinyu Wu; Luyi Yang; Xiaoxi Xu","Department of Orthodontics, Hospital of Stomatology, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, PR China.; Key Laboratory of Dairy Science, Ministry of Education, College of Food Science, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, PR China.; Department of Orthodontics, Hospital of Stomatology, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, PR China.

Immunoadjuvant (CpG) and carbon dot (CD) co-loaded plant lipid nanoparticles (CD/CpG@LNPs) are constructed and conjugated to the surface of Limosilactobacillus reuteri (LR) via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive linkers. The inherent photothermal and photodynamic properties of oral CD/CpG@LNPs induce in situ cytotoxic ROS generation and immunogenic cell death of colorectal tumor cells. The generated neoantigens and the released CpG function as a potent in situ vaccine that stimulates the maturation of immature dendritic cells. The mature dendritic cells and metabolites secreted by LR subsequently facilitated the tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eradicate colorectal tumors.

However, none of these studies used multi-omics analysis combining genetic regulation, microbiota, and metabolites to explain the site-specific difference. Here, 494 participants from a 16S rRNA gene sequencing cohort (50 RCC, 114 LCC, and 100 healthy controls) and a multi-omics cohort (63 RCC, 79 LCC, and 88 healthy controls) were analyzed. 16S rRNA gene, metagenomic sequencing, and metabolomics analyses of fecal samples were evaluated to identify tumor location-related bacteria and metabolites. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) were conducted to obtain the mutation burden and genomic expression pattern. We found unique profiles of the intestinal microbiome, metabolome, and host genome between RCC and LCC. The bacteria Flavonifractor plautii (Fp) and Fusobacterium nucleatum, the metabolites L-phenylalanine, and the host genes PHLDA1 and WBP1 were the key omics features of RCC; whereas the bacteria Bacteroides sp. A1C1 (B.A1C1) and Parvimonas micra, the metabolites L-citrulline and D-ornithine, and the host genes TCF25 and HLA-DRB5 were considered the dominant omics features in LCC. Multi-omics correlation analysis indicated that RCC-enriched Fp was related to the accumulation of the metabolite L-phenylalanine and the suppressed WBP1 signal in RCC patients. In addition, LCC-enriched B.A1C1 was associated with the accumulation of the metabolites D-ornithine and L-citrulline as well as activation of the genes TCF25, HLA-DRB5, and AC079354.1. Our findings identify previously unknown links between intestinal microbiota alterations, metabolites, and host genomics in RCC vs. LCC, suggesting that it may be possible to treat colorectal cancer (CRC) by targeting the gut microbiota-host interaction.

Phytoconstituents are being studied for their synergistic effects, which include disease prevention by altering molecular pathways and immunomodulation without side effects. The present experiment aims to explore the cancer preventive activities of Argemone mexicana Linn leaves extract in skin cancer cell lines (A431) and colon cancer cell lines (COLO 320DM)). In addition, TNF-α expression patterns and NF-kB signaling pathways have been examined. LC/MS study of Argemone mexicana Linn extracts in various solvents revealed anti-cancerous phytoconstituents. Network pharmacology analysis used Binding DB, STRING, DAVID, and KEGG for data mining to evaluate predicted compounds using functional annotation analysis. Cytoscape 3.2.1 created ""neighbourhood approach"" and networks. The MNTD of these extracts was tested on L929 fibroblasts. Skin cancer (A431) and colon cancer (COLO 320DM) cell lines were tested for IC50 inhibition. Evaluation of TNF-α and NF-kB expression in cell culture supernatants and homogenates reveals anti-cancerous effects. LC-MS analysis of extracts predicted the presence of anticancer alkaloids Berberine, Atropine, Argemexicin, and Argemonin. In Network pharmacology analysis, enrichment was linked to the PI3-AKT pathway for both cancer types. MNTD was calculated at 1000μg/ml in L929. The ethanolic extract at 1000μg/ml significantly inhibited skin cancer cell proliferation by 67% and colon cancer cells by 75%. Ethanolic extract significantly reduced TNF-α expression in both cell lines (p<0.001), with the highest inhibition at 1000μg/ml. In TNF-α stimulated cell lines, 1000μg/ml ethanolic extract significantly reduced the regulation of the NF-kB pathway, which plays a role in cancer progression (p<0.001). Argemone mexicana Linn. known as 'swarnkshiri' in Ayurveda has been reported to be used by the traditional healers for the treatment of psoriasis and its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancerous properties, according to the Indian Medicinal Plant dictionary. In the experiment, the abatement in the expression of inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and inhibition of NF-kB transcription factor activation could be linked with the downregulation of cancer cell proliferation. The study revealed the anticancer activity of Argemone mexicana Linn in the cancer cell lines and paved a pathway for molecular approaches that could be explored more in In vivo studies.","2024","2024","Sunanda Kulshrestha; Anjana Goel; Subhadip Banerjee; Rohit Sharma; Mohammad Rashid Khan; Kow-Tong Chen","Department of Biotechnology, GLA University, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India.; Department of Biotechnology, GLA University, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India.; School of Natural Products Studies, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.; Department of Rasa Shastra and Bhaishajya Kalpana, Faculty of Ayurveda, Institute of Medical Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Occupational Medicine, Tainan Municipal Hospital (managed by ShowChwan Medical Care Corporation), Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan."

However, with the development of personalized therapy, we realized that in scientific research, two-dimensional cell lines lost a lot of original characteristic information during long-term culture, and the results obtained may not be enough to support the conclusion. Patient-derived tumor organoids maintain genomic stability and make up for information missing from cell lines due to monoclonal growth. Therefore, in our study, a colon cancer organoid with high PHGDH expression was selected and analyzed for transcriptomic and metabolomic changes through targeted inhibition of PHGDH. The results showed that inhibition of PHGDH significantly inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer organoids. The transcriptome, metabolome, and combined omics analysis showed that the changes in colon cancer organoids after inhibition of PHGDH were mainly involved in PRSS1 and PRSS56, steroid hormone biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, and tyrosine metabolism.

Normal wound healing is represented by a transitory phase of inflammation, followed by a pro-resolution phase, with prostaglandin (PGE2/PGD2)-induced 'lipid class switching' producing inflammation-quenching lipoxins (LXA4, LXB4). We explored if lipid dysregulation in colorectal cancers (CRCs) is driven by a failure to resolve inflammation. We performed liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) untargeted analysis of 40 human CRC and normal paired samples and targeted, quantitative analysis of 81 human CRC and normal paired samples. We integrated analysis of lipidomics, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, large scale gene expression, and spatial transcriptomics with public scRNASEQ data to characterize pattern, expression and cellular localisation of genes that produce and modify lipid mediators. Targeted, quantitative LC-MS/MS demonstrated a marked imbalance of pro-inflammatory mediators, with a dearth of resolving lipid mediators. In tumours, we observed prominent over-expression of arachidonic acid derivatives, the genes encoding their synthetic enzymes and receptors, but poor expression of genes producing pro-resolving synthetic enzymes and resultant lipoxins (LXA4, LXB4) and associated receptors. These results indicate that CRC is the product of defective lipid class switching likely related to inadequate or ineffective levels of PGE2/PGD2. We show that the lipidomic profile of CRC tumours exhibits a distinct pro-inflammatory bias with a deficiency of endogenous resolving mediators secondary to defective lipid class switching. These observations pave the way for 'resolution medicine', a novel therapeutic approach for inducing or providing resolvins to mitigate the chronic inflammation driving cancer growth and progression.","2025","2025 Mar 06","Ramani Soundararajan; Michelle M Maurin; Jetsen Rodriguez-Silva; Gunjan Upadhyay; Ashley J Alden; Siddabasave Gowda B Gowda; Michael J Schell; Mingli Yang; Noah Jhad Levine; Divyavani Gowda; Punith M Sundaraswamy; Shu-Ping Hui; Lance Pflieger; Heiman Wang; Jorge Marcet; Carolina Martinez; Robert David Bennett; Allen Chudzinski; Andreas Karachristos; Timothy M Nywening; Paul M Cavallaro; Matthew Linley Anderson; Robert J Coffey; Michael V Nebozhyn; Andrey Loboda; Domenico Coppola; Warren Jackson Pledger; Ganesh V Halade; Timothy J Yeatman","Department of Surgery, University of South Florida Health, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Surgery, University of South Florida Health, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Surgery, University of South Florida Health, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Florida Health, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Surgery, University of South Florida Health, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-12, Nishi-5, Kita-ku, Sappora, Japan.; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Department, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Surgery, University of South Florida Health, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Center for Phenom Health, Buck Institute for Research on Aging, Novato, California, USA.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-12, Nishi-5, Kita-ku, Sappora, Japan.; Graduate School of Global Food Resources, Hokkaido University, Kita-9, Nishi-9, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Japan.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-12, Nishi-5, Kita-ku, Sappora, Japan.; Center for Phenom Health, Buck Institute for Research on Aging, Novato, California, USA.; Department of Surgery, University of South Florida Health, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Surgery, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Surgery, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Surgery, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Surgery, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Surgery, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Surgery, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Surgery, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Surgery, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Merck Research Laboratories Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Merck Research Laboratories Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Pathology, Florida Digestive Health Specialists LLP, Bradenton, Florida, USA.; Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Molecular Medicine, University of South Florida Health, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Florida Health, Tampa, Florida, USA.; Department of Surgery, University of South Florida Health, Tampa, Florida, USA yeatman7383@gmail.com."

A total of 95,275 participants from UK Biobank with plasma metabolomics and dietary information were analyzed. Metabolite profile scores for 14 dietary patterns were estimated through elastic net regression. Cox regression analysis assessed the associations of dietary patterns and their metabolite profile scores with colorectal tumor risk. Mediating effects of identified metabolite profile scores were estimated in the associations. Fourteen metabolite profile scores, including a range of 28 to 205 signatures, were weak to moderate correlation with dietary patterns (all p < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analyses revealed that five dietary patterns were significantly correlated with a decreased risk of colorectal tumor after FDR correction and adjustment for covariates. HRs (95% CIs) per 1 SD for these diet patterns were as follows: WCRF (0.93, 0.90-0.96), CRC score (0.94, 0.92-0.97), AHEI-2010 (0.95, 0.92-0.97), DASH (0.94, 0.91-0.97), and hPDI (0.95, 0.93-0.98). Similarly, metabolite profile scores for these five dietary patterns were inversely associated with colorectal tumor risk, with HRs (95% CIs) per 1 SD as follows: WCRF (0.59, 0.49-0.70), CRC score (0.67, 0.58-0.77), AHEI-2010 (0.73, 0.65-0.80), DASH (0.75, 0.66-0.84), and hPDI (0.56, 0.47-0.67). The mediation proportions of five metabolite profile scores between dietary patterns and colorectal tumor risk ranged from 6.37 to 27.23% (all p < 0.001). Five dietary patterns and their metabolite profile scores, were inversely correlated with colorectal tumor risk. These findings highlight the potential of metabolite profiles as mediators in the association between dietary patterns and the risk of colorectal tumor, further contributing to the prevention of colorectal cancer or adenoma and providing new insights for future research.","2024","2024 Nov 21","Jingjing Ni; Haojie Lu; Weiyi Chen; Yingying Zhao; Shuaishuai Yang; Jia Zhang; Zhen Wang; Yuting Shi; Jing Yi; Jia Li; Xuemei Song; Yuxin Ni; Sijia Zhu; Zhihao Zhang; Li Liu","Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, 430030, P.R.

Herein, a GC-MS based metabolomics approach was employed to investigate the impact of bevacizumab on the serum metabolome of colon cancer rats. Multivariate chemometric analysis models such as PCA and PLS-DA showed a clear separation between the control, cancer and bevacizumab-treated groups, suggesting that bevacizumab administration induced significant metabolic alterations. Furthermore, pairwise comparisons between the studied groups using the OPLS-DA model in addition to univariate analysis identified several discriminatory metabolites belonged to various chemical classes including amino acids, organic acids and fatty acids that were perturbed between the studied groups. Interestingly, bevacizumab treatment was able to partially restore some of the cancer-induced metabolic disturbances, indicating its potential therapeutic efficacy via improving the tumor vasculature and nutrient delivery. Besides, pathway analysis of the differential metabolites identified key metabolic pathways affected by bevacizumab, which included valine, leucine and isoleucine metabolism, pyruvate metabolism and butanoate metabolism. However, little effects were observed on lipid metabolites such as palmitic acid and stearic acid and consequently their related metabolic pathways such as fatty acid biosynthesis metabolism suggesting that bevacizumab has more prominent effect on energy and amino acid metabolisms as compared to fatty acid metabolism in colon cancer rats. Overall, our study provided novel insights into the metabolic mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of bevacizumab in colon cancer rats via the use of a comprehensive GC-MS metabolomics approach.","2025","2025 Jan 15","Maram H Abduljabbar; Yusuf S Althobaiti; Reem M Alnemari; Farooq M Almutairi; Muneef M Aldhafeeri; Ahmed Serag; Atiah H Almalki","Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Taif University, P.O.

Although some research has been conducted on the gut microbiota, there have been limited empirical investigations on the role of the microbial-derived metabolites in CRC. In this study, we used LC-MS and 16S rRNA sequencing to identify gut microbiome-associated fecal metabolites in patients with CRC and healthy controls. Moreover, we examined the effects of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and tyrosol on CRC by establishing orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor mouse models. Additionally, we conducted in vitro experiments to investigate the mechanism through which tyrosol inhibits tumor cell growth. Our study revealed changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome that are linked to CRC. We observed that Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a bacterium known for its multiple anti-CRC properties, is significantly more abundant in the intestines of healthy individuals than in those of individuals with CRC. In mouse tumor models, our study illustrated that Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has the ability to inhibit tumor growth by reducing inflammatory responses and enhancing tumor immunity. Additionally, research investigating the relationship between CRC-associated features and microbe-metabolite interactions revealed a correlation between Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and tyrosol, both of which are less abundant in the intestines of tumor patients. Tyrosol demonstrated antitumor activity in vivo and specifically targeted CRC cells without affecting intestinal epithelial cells in cell experiments. Moreover, tyrosol treatment effectively reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines in MC38 cells. Western blot analysis further revealed that tyrosol inhibited the activation of the NF-κB and HIF-1 signaling pathways. This study investigated the relationship between CRC development and changes in the gut microbiota and microbial-derived metabolites. Specifically, the intestinal metabolite tyrosol exhibits antitumor effects by inhibiting HIF-1α/NF-κB signaling pathway activation, leading to a reduction in the levels of ROS and inflammatory factors. These findings indicate that manipulating the gut microbiota and its metabolites could be a promising approach for preventing and treating CRC and could provide insights for the development of anticancer drugs.","2024","2024 Sep 28","Jian Guo; Fanqi Meng; Ruixue Hu; Lei Chen; Jiang Chang; Ke Zhao; Honglin Ren; Zengshan Liu; Pan Hu; Guangyi Wang; Jiandong Tai","Department of Colorectal&anal surgery, General Surgery Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.; State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Severe Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory for Zoonosis Research of the Ministry of Education, Institute of Zoonosis, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.; Department of Colorectal&anal surgery, General Surgery Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.; State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Severe Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory for Zoonosis Research of the Ministry of Education, Institute of Zoonosis, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.; Department of Colorectal&anal surgery, General Surgery Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.; State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Severe Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory for Zoonosis Research of the Ministry of Education, Institute of Zoonosis, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.; State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Severe Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory for Zoonosis Research of the Ministry of Education, Institute of Zoonosis, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.; State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Severe Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory for Zoonosis Research of the Ministry of Education, Institute of Zoonosis, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.; State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Severe Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory for Zoonosis Research of the Ministry of Education, Institute of Zoonosis, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.; State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Severe Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory for Zoonosis Research of the Ministry of Education, Institute of Zoonosis, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China taijd@jlu.edu.cn guangyi@jlu.edu.cn hupan84@163.com.; Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, General Surgery Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China taijd@jlu.edu.cn guangyi@jlu.edu.cn hupan84@163.com.; Department of Colorectal&anal surgery, General Surgery Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China taijd@jlu.edu.cn guangyi@jlu.edu.cn hupan84@163.com."

Dietary habits also shape gut microbiota, but the role of the combination between diet, the gut microbiota, and the metabolite profile on CRC risk is still missing an unequivocal characterisation. To investigate how gut microbiota affects diet-associated CRC risk, we fed Apc-mutated PIRC rats and azoxymethane (AOM)-induced rats the following diets: a high-risk red/processed meat-based diet (MBD), a normalised risk diet (MBD with α-tocopherol, MBDT), a low-risk pesco-vegetarian diet (PVD), and control diet. We then conducted faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from PIRC rats to germ-free rats treated with AOM and fed a standard diet for 3 months. We analysed multiple tumour markers and assessed the variations in the faecal microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing together with targeted- and untargeted-metabolomics analyses. In both animal models, the PVD group exhibited significantly lower colon tumorigenesis than the MBD ones, consistent with various CRC biomarkers. Faecal microbiota and its metabolites also revealed significant diet-dependent profiles. Intriguingly, when faeces from PIRC rats fed these diets were transplanted into germ-free rats, those transplanted with MBD faeces developed a higher number of preneoplastic lesions together with distinctive diet-related bacterial and metabolic profiles. PVD determines a selection of nine taxonomic markers mainly belonging to Lachnospiraceae and Prevotellaceae families exclusively associated with at least two different animal models, and within these, four taxonomic markers were shared across all the three animal models. An inverse correlation between nonconjugated bile acids and bacterial genera mainly belonging to the Lachnospiraceae and Prevotellaceae families (representative of the PVD group) was present, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for the protective effect of these genera against CRC. These results highlight the protective effects of PVD while reaffirming the carcinogenic properties of MBD diets. In germ-free rats, FMT induced changes reminiscent of dietary effects, including heightened preneoplastic lesions in MBD rats and the transmission of specific diet-related bacterial and metabolic profiles. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that diet-associated cancer risk can be transferred with faeces, establishing gut microbiota as a determinant of diet-associated CRC risk. Therefore, this study marks the pioneering demonstration of faecal transfer as a means of conveying diet-related cancer risk, firmly establishing the gut microbiota as a pivotal factor in diet-associated CRC susceptibility.

Guadua species are renowned bamboos for their high phenolic compound content, including flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, and possess noteworthy biological properties. Despite this, there is a notable scarcity of research on the chemical and biological aspects of Latin American bamboo leaf extracts (BLEs), especially concerning the Guadua genus. This study aimed to employ a metabolomics approach to integrate the phytochemical and activity profiles of BLEs to identify potential bioactive markers. We determined the metabolic fingerprints of 30 BLEs through HPTLC, HPLC-DAD, UHPLC-QTOF-MS, and 1H-NMR analyses and screened for antioxidant and cytotoxic activities using ABTS, DPPH, and MTT methods. Ultimately, correlation analyses were performed by using chemometric methods and molecular networking. Our findings present a comprehensive chemical characterization, encompassing 40 flavonoids and 9 cinnamic acid derivatives. Notably, most of these compounds have been reported for the first time within the genus, signifying novel discoveries. Additionally, certain compounds identified in other species of the subfamily Bambusoideae provide valuable comparative insights. These compounds demonstrated a significant correlation with antioxidant potential, with values exceeding 100 and 30 μmol of TE/g of extract for ABTS and DPPH, respectively, in the samples. Extracts from G. incana and G. angustifolia exhibited potent cytotoxic effects with IC50 values of 1.23 and 4.73 μg/mL against HCT-116 colon cancer cells, respectively. Notably, glycosylated flavones showed a strong correlation with cytotoxicity. These new findings significantly contribute to our understanding of the chemical composition and biological properties of these often overlooked bamboo species, providing them with important added value and alternative use.","2024","2024 Sep 03","Luis Carlos Chitiva; Paula Rezende-Teixeira; Tiago F Leão; Hair Santiago Lozano-Puentes; Ximena Londoño; Lucía Ana Díaz-Ariza; Leticia V Costa-Lotufo; Juliet A Prieto-Rodríguez; Geison M Costa; Ian Castro-Gamboa","Núcleo de Bioensaios, Biossíntese e Ecofisiologia de Produtos Naturais (NuBBE), Institute of Chemistry, São Paulo State University (UNESP), Araraquara, São Paulo 14800-901, Brazil.; Grupo de Investigación Fitoquímica Universidad Javeriana (GIFUJ), Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá 110231, Colombia.; Laboratório de Farmacologia de Produtos Naturais Marinhos, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, São Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.; Núcleo de Bioensaios, Biossíntese e Ecofisiologia de Produtos Naturais (NuBBE), Institute of Chemistry, São Paulo State University (UNESP), Araraquara, São Paulo 14800-901, Brazil.; Laboratorio Asociaciones, Suelo, Planta, Microorganismo (LAMIC), Grupo de Investigación en Agricultura Biológica, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá 110231, Colombia.; Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Palmira 763533, Colombia.; Laboratorio Asociaciones, Suelo, Planta, Microorganismo (LAMIC), Grupo de Investigación en Agricultura Biológica, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá 110231, Colombia.; Laboratório de Farmacologia de Produtos Naturais Marinhos, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, São Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.; Grupo de Investigación Fitoquímica Universidad Javeriana (GIFUJ), Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá 110231, Colombia.; Grupo de Investigación Fitoquímica Universidad Javeriana (GIFUJ), Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá 110231, Colombia.; Núcleo de Bioensaios, Biossíntese e Ecofisiologia de Produtos Naturais (NuBBE), Institute of Chemistry, São Paulo State University (UNESP), Araraquara, São Paulo 14800-901, Brazil."

Indole-based microbial metabolite mimics FKK6, which is a ligand and agonist of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), was recently demonstrated to have PXR-dependent anti-inflammatory and protective effects in a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced acute colitis. Here, we examined the therapeutic potential of FKK6 in a mouse model (C57BL/6 FVB humanized PXR mice) of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). FKK6 (2 mg/kg) displayed substantial anti-tumor activity, as revealed by reduced size and number of colon tumors, improved colon histopathology, and decreased expression of tumor markers (c-MYC, β-catenin, Ki-67, cyclin D) in the colon. In addition, we carried out the chronic toxicity (30 days) assessment of FKK6 (1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) in C57BL/6 mice. Histological examination of tissues, biochemical blood analyses, and immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 and γ-H2AX showed no difference between FKK6-treated and control mice. Comparative metabolomic analyses in mice exposed for 5 days to DSS and administered with FKK6 (0.4 mg/kg) revealed no significant effects on several classes of metabolites in the mouse fecal metabolome. Ames and micronucleus tests showed no genotoxic and mutagenic potential of FKK6 in vitro . In conclusion, anticancer effects of FKK6 in AOM/DSS-induced CAC, together with FKK6 safety data from in vitro tests and in vivo chronic toxicity study, and comparative metabolomic study, are supportive of the potential therapeutic use of FKK6 in the treatment of CAC.","2024","2024 Jul 30","Lucia Sládeková; Hao Li; Vera M DesMarais; Amanda P Beck; Hillary Guzik; Barbora Vyhlídalová; Haiwei Gu; Sridhar Mani; Zdeněk Dvořák",""

Previous studies have highlighted its benefits against carcinoma, but its interaction with the gut microbiota and effects on adenomatous polyps are not well understood. This present study investigates the effects of AS-IV on colonic adenomatous polyp (CAP) development in high-fat-diet (HFD) fed [Formula: see text] mice. [Formula: see text] mice were fed an HFD with or without AS-IV or Naringin for 8 weeks. The study assessed CAP proliferation and employed 16S DNA-sequencing and untargeted metabolomics to explore correlations between microbiome and metabolome in CAP development. AS-IV was more effective than Naringin in reducing CAP development, inhibiting colonic proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), tumor associated biomarkers (c-Myc, Cyclin D1), and Wnt/β-catenin pathway proteins (Wnt3a, β-catenin). AS-IV also inhibited the proliferative capabilities of human colon cancer cells (HT29, HCT116, and SW620). Multiomics analysis revealed AS-IV increased the abundance of beneficial genera such as Bifidobacterium pseudolongum and significantly modulated serum levels of certain metabolites including linoleate and 2-trans,6-trans-farnesal, which were significantly correlated with the number of CAP. Finally, the anti-adenoma efficacy of AS-IV alone was significantly suppressed post pseudoaseptic intervention in HFD-fed [Formula: see text] mice but could be reinstated following a combined with Bifidobacterium pseudolongum transplant. AS-IV attenuates CAP development in HFD-fed [Formula: see text] mice by regulating gut microbiota and metabolomics, impacting the Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathway. This suggests a potential new strategy for the prevention of colorectal cancer, emphasizing the role of gut microbiota in AS-IV's antitumor effects.","2024","2024","Lu-Ping Wen; Shao-Wei Gao; Hua-Xian Chen; Qi Liu; Guo-Zhong Xiao; Hong-Cheng Lin; Qiu-Lan He","School of Integrative Medicine, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, P.

Berberine (BBR) has a long history in the treatment of intestinal diseases, which has been reported to inhibit colitis and CRC. However, the mechanism of its action is still unclear. Here, this study aimed to explore the potential protective effects of BBR on azoxymethane (AOM)/dextransulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and tumor mice, and to elucidate its potential molecular mechanisms by microbiota, genes and metabolic alterations. The results showed that BBR inhibited the gut inflammation and improved the function of mucosal barrier to ameliorate AOM/DSS-induced colitis. And BBR treatment significantly reduced intestinal tumor development and ki-67 expression of intestinal tissue along with promoted apoptosis. Through microbiota analysis based on the 16 S rRNA gene, we found that BBR treatment improved intestinal microbiota imbalance in AOM/DSS-induced colitis and tumor mice, which were characterized by an increase of beneficial bacteria, for instance Akkermanisa, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides acidifaciens. In addition, transcriptome analysis showed that BBR regulated colonic epithelial signaling pathway in CAC mice particularly by tryptophan metabolism and Wnt signaling pathway. Notably, BBR treatment resulted in the enrichment of amino acids metabolism and microbiota-derived SCFA metabolites. In summary, our research findings suggest that the gut microbiota-amino acid metabolism-Wnt signaling pathway axis plays critical role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, which may provide new insights into the inhibitory effects of BBR on colitis and colon cancer.","2024","2024 Oct","Mengxia Wang; Yan Ma; Guodong Yu; Bao Zeng; Wenhao Yang; Cuihong Huang; Yujuan Dong; Benqin Tang; Zhengzhi Wu","Dpartment of Medical Science, Shunde Polytechnic, Foshan, China; Academician Workstation，NingBo College of Health Sciences, NingBo, China.; Dpartment of Medical Science, Shunde Polytechnic, Foshan, China.; Dpartment of Medical Science, Shunde Polytechnic, Foshan, China.; Dpartment of Medical Science, Shunde Polytechnic, Foshan, China.; Dpartment of Medical Science, Shunde Polytechnic, Foshan, China.; Dpartment of Medical Science, Shunde Polytechnic, Foshan, China.; GuangDong Second Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Guangzhou, China.

Pheo a was used as a model photosensitizer, either in its free form or encapsulated within poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PEO-PCL) polymer micelles. Block copolymer micelles are water-soluble biocompatible nanocontainers with great potential for delivering hydrophobic drugs. Empty PEO-PCL micelles were also tested throughout the experiments. The goal was to conduct an in vitro investigation into human colorectal tumor HCT-116 cellular responses induced by free and encapsulated Pheo a in terms of cell architecture, plasma membrane exchanges, mitochondrial function, and metabolic disturbances. In a calibrated PDT protocol, encapsulation enhanced Pheo a penetration (flow cytometry, confocal microscopy) and cell death (Prestoblue assay), causing massive changes to cell morphology (SEM) and cytoskeleton organization (confocal), mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of integrity (TEM), rapid and massive ion fluxes across the plasma membrane (ICP-OES, ion chromatography), and metabolic alterations, including increased levels of amino acids and choline derivatives (1H NMR). The detailed investigation provides insights into the multifaceted effects of encapsulated Pheo-PDT, emphasizing the importance of considering both the photosensitizer and its delivery system in understanding therapeutic outcomes. The study also raises questions as to the broader impact of empty nanovectors per se, and encourages a more comprehensive exploration of their biological effects.","2024","2024 Sep 30","Rachel Brival; Nathan Ghafari; Anne-Françoise Mingotaud; Isabelle Fourquaux; Véronique Gilard; Fabrice Collin; Patricia Vicendo; Stéphane Balayssac; Laure Gibot","Laboratoire Softmat, Université de Toulouse, CNRS UMR 5623, Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier, 31062 Toulouse, France; Centre de Microscopie Electronique Appliquée à la Biologie, Faculté de Médecine Toulouse Rangueil, Université de Toulouse, 133, route de Narbonne, 31062 Toulouse, France.; Laboratoire Softmat, Université de Toulouse, CNRS UMR 5623, Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier, 31062 Toulouse, France.; Laboratoire Softmat, Université de Toulouse, CNRS UMR 5623, Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier, 31062 Toulouse, France.; Centre de Microscopie Electronique Appliquée à la Biologie, Faculté de Médecine Toulouse Rangueil, Université de Toulouse, 133, route de Narbonne, 31062 Toulouse, France.; Laboratoire Softmat, Université de Toulouse, CNRS UMR 5623, Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier, 31062 Toulouse, France.; Laboratoire Softmat, Université de Toulouse, CNRS UMR 5623, Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier, 31062 Toulouse, France.; Laboratoire Softmat, Université de Toulouse, CNRS UMR 5623, Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier, 31062 Toulouse, France.; Laboratoire Softmat, Université de Toulouse, CNRS UMR 5623, Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier, 31062 Toulouse, France.; Laboratoire Softmat, Université de Toulouse, CNRS UMR 5623, Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier, 31062 Toulouse, France.

Previous studies have demonstrated the cytotoxic potential of bamboo leaf extract obtained from Guadua incana (BLEGI) against HCT-116 colon cancer cells. However, the altered metabolic pathways in these tumor cells remain unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to employ an untargeted metabolomic approach to reveal the metabolic alterations of the endometabolome and exometabolome of HCT-116 cells upon exposure to BLEGI treatment. First, a chemical characterization of the BLEGI was conducted through liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Next, we assessed cell viability via MTT and morphological analysis using an immunofluorescence assay against colon cancer cells, and anti-inflammatory activity using an LPS-stimulated macrophage model. Subsequently, we employed LC-MS and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) to investigate intra- and extracellular changes. Chemical characterization primarily revealed the presence of compounds with a flavone glycoside scaffold. Immunofluorescence analysis showed condensed chromatin and subsequent formation of apoptotic bodies, suggesting cell death by apoptosis. The results of the metabolomic analysis showed 98 differential metabolites, involved in glutathione, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and lipoic acid metabolism, among others. Additionally, BLEGI demonstrated significant nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory capacity in macrophage cells. This study enhances our understanding of BLEGI's possible mechanism of action and provides fresh insights into therapeutic targets for treating this disease.","2024","2024 Jun 23","Luis Carlos Chitiva; Mary Andrea Santamaría-Torres; Paula Rezende-Teixeira; Jessica Rodrigues Pereira de Oliveira Borlot; Rodrigo de Almeida Romagna; Ximena Londoño; Rodrigo Rezende Kitagawa; Leticia V Costa-Lotufo; Juliet A Prieto-Rodríguez; Ian Castro-Gamboa; Geison Modesti Costa","Grupo de Investigación Fitoquímica Universidad Javeriana (GIFUJ), Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá 110231, Colombia.; Núcleo de Bioensaios, Biossíntese e Ecofisiologia de Produtos Naturais (NuBBE), Institute of Chemistry, São Paulo State University (UNESP), Araraquara 14800-900, Brazil.; Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá 111711, Colombia.; Laboratório de Farmacologia de Produtos Naturais Marinhos, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.; Laboratório de Triagem Biológica de Produtos Naturais, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES), Vitoria 29047-105, Brazil.; Laboratório de Triagem Biológica de Produtos Naturais, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES), Vitoria 29047-105, Brazil.; Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Palmira 763533, Colombia.; Laboratório de Triagem Biológica de Produtos Naturais, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES), Vitoria 29047-105, Brazil.; Laboratório de Farmacologia de Produtos Naturais Marinhos, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.; Grupo de Investigación Fitoquímica Universidad Javeriana (GIFUJ), Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá 110231, Colombia.; Núcleo de Bioensaios, Biossíntese e Ecofisiologia de Produtos Naturais (NuBBE), Institute of Chemistry, São Paulo State University (UNESP), Araraquara 14800-900, Brazil.; Grupo de Investigación Fitoquímica Universidad Javeriana (GIFUJ), Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá 110231, Colombia."

Given the considerable prevalence of pks+ bacteria in healthy individuals, we sought to identify strategies to limit the growth and expansion of pks+ E. coli. We found that culture supernatants of the probiotic strain E. coli Nissle 1917 were able to inhibit the growth of the murine pathogenic strain pks+ E. coli NC101 (EcNC101). We performed a nontargeted analysis of the metabolome in supernatants from several E. coli strains and identified putrescine as a potential postbiotic capable of suppressing EcNC101 growth in vitro. The effect of putrescine supplementation was then evaluated in the azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium mouse model of colorectal cancer in mice colonized with EcNC101. Putrescine supplementation inhibited the growth of pks+ E. coli, reduced the number and size of colonic tumors, and downmodulated the release of inflammatory cytokines in the colonic lumen. Additionally, putrescine supplementation led to shifts in the composition and function of gut microbiota, characterized by an increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and enhanced acetate production. The effect of putrescine was further confirmed in vitro using a pks+ E. coli strain isolated from a patient with colorectal cancer. These results suggest that probiotic-derived metabolites can be used as an alternative to live bacteria in individuals at risk of developing colorectal cancer due to the presence of pks+ bacteria in their colon. Putrescine supplementation inhibits the growth of cancer-promoting bacteria in the gut, lowers inflammation, and reduces colon cancer development. The consumption of healthy foods rich in putrescine may be a potential prophylactic approach for individuals at risk of developing colorectal cancer due to the presence of pks+ bacteria in their colon.","2024","2024 Jul 01","Manon Oliero; Thibault Cuisiniere; Ayodeji S Ajayi; Claire Gerkins; Roy Hajjar; Gabriela Fragoso; Annie Calvé; Hervé Vennin Rendos; Annabelle Mathieu-Denoncourt; François Dagbert; Éric De Broux; Rasmy Loungnarath; Frank Schwenter; Herawaty Sebajang; Richard Ratelle; Ramses Wassef; Carole Richard; Marylise Duperthuy; Andrée E Gravel; Antony T Vincent; Manuela M Santos","Nutrition and Microbiome Laboratory, Institut du cancer de Montréal, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Nutrition and Microbiome Laboratory, Institut du cancer de Montréal, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Nutrition and Microbiome Laboratory, Institut du cancer de Montréal, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Nutrition and Microbiome Laboratory, Institut du cancer de Montréal, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Nutrition and Microbiome Laboratory, Institut du cancer de Montréal, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Nutrition and Microbiome Laboratory, Institut du cancer de Montréal, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Nutrition and Microbiome Laboratory, Institut du cancer de Montréal, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Nutrition and Microbiome Laboratory, Institut du cancer de Montréal, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Department of Microbiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Digestive Surgery Service, Department of Surgery, Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Digestive Surgery Service, Department of Surgery, Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Digestive Surgery Service, Department of Surgery, Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Digestive Surgery Service, Department of Surgery, Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Digestive Surgery Service, Department of Surgery, Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Digestive Surgery Service, Department of Surgery, Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Digestive Surgery Service, Department of Surgery, Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Digestive Surgery Service, Department of Surgery, Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Department of Microbiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Drug Discovery Platform, Research Institute McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Canada.; Département des sciences animales, Faculté des sciences de l'agriculture et de l'alimentation, Université Laval, Quebec City, Canada.; Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes, Université Laval, Quebec City, Canada.; Nutrition and Microbiome Laboratory, Institut du cancer de Montréal, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada."

Our results demonstrate that OSI-027 more effectively inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation than rapamycin. Additionally, we identified nearly 600 metabolites from the spectra, revealing significant differences in metabolic patterns between cells treated with OSI-027 and rapamycin. Through VIP value screening, we pinpointed crucial metabolites contributing to these distinctions. For inhibiting glycolysis and reducing glucose consumption, OSI-027 was likely to be more potent than rapamycin. For amino acids metabolism, although OSI-027 has a broad effect as rapamycin, their effects in degrees were not exactly the same.

Identifying potential biomarkers of CRC is crucial for treatment and drug development. Methods: In this study, we established a C57B/6N mouse model of colon carcinogenesis using azoxymethane-dextran sodium sulfate (AOM-DSS) treatment for 14 weeks to identify proteins associated with colon cancer. An isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic analysis was conducted on the cell membrane components enriched in the colonic mucosa. Additionally, tumor tissues and adjacent normal colon tissues were collected from patients with colon cancer for comparative protein and metabolite analyses. Results: In total, 74 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the tumor tissue samples from AOM/DSS-treated mice compared to both the adjacent tissue samples from AOM/DSS-treated mice and tissue samples from saline-treated control mice. Bioinformatics analysis revealed eight downregulated proteins enriched in the branched-chain amino acids pathway (valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation). Moreover, these proteins are already known to be associated with the survival rate of patients with cancer. Targeted metabolomics showed increased levels of valine, leucine, and isoleucine in tumor tissues compared to those in adjacent normal tissues in patients with colon cancer. Furthermore, a real-time PCR experiment demonstrated that Aldehyde dehydrogenase, mitochondrial (short protein name ALDH2, gene name Aldh2) and Hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, mitochondrial (short protein name HCDH, gene name Hadh) (two genes) in the pathway of branched-chain amino acids) were downregulated in patients with colon cancer (colon tumor tissues vs. their adjacent colon tissues). ALDH2 expression was further validated by western blotting in AOM/DSS-treated mouse model and in clinical samples. Conclusion: This study highlighted the inactivation of the branched-chain amino acid degradation pathway in colon cancer and identified ALDH2 and HCDH as potential biomarkers for diagnosing colon cancer and developing new therapeutic strategies.","2024","2024","Shixian Lian; Siyuan Liu; Ao Wu; Lin Yin; Lei Li; Liyan Zeng; Mingkun Zhao; Lijun Zhang","Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai 201508, China.; Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200011, China.; Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai 201508, China.; Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai 201508, China.; Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai 201508, China.; Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai 201508, China.; Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai 201508, China.; Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai 201508, China."

The aim of this work is to provide a new theoretical basis for tumour initiation and development by accurately measuring the spatial distribution of lipids and metabolites in intestinal tissue. Spatial metabolomics allows the detection of samples with minimal sample volume by label-free imaging of complex samples in their original state. The distribution of lipid molecules in tumours has not been reported, although the distribution of lipid molecules in intestinal tissue has been reported in the literature. The range of lipid profiles in colon cancer mouse tumour tissue was compiled using a spatial metabolomics: lipid extraction method. The changes in lipid distribution in two regions after oral administration of American Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) vesicles were also compared. Tumour tissue samples were extracted with 80% methanol-20% formic acid in water. The resulting spatial metabolic profile allowed the identification of seven lipid classes in mouse tumours.

In our previous research, we demonstrated the anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant effects of oat beta-glucans in gastrointestinal disease models. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an 8-week consumption of a diet supplemented with low-molar-mass oat beta-glucan in two doses on the antioxidant potential, inflammatory parameters, and colonic metabolomic profile in azoxymethane(AOM)-induced early-stage colorectal cancer in the large intestine wall of rats. The results showed a statistically significant effect of AOM leading to the development of neoplastic changes in the colon. Consumption of beta-glucans induced changes in colonic antioxidant potential parameters, including an increase in total antioxidant status, a decrease in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and a reduction in thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) concentration. In addition, beta-glucans decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-12) and C-reactive protein (CRP) while increasing the concentration of IL-10. Metabolomic studies confirmed the efficacy of oat beta-glucans in the AOM-induced early-stage colon cancer model by increasing the levels of metabolites involved in metabolic pathways, such as amino acids, purine, biotin, and folate. In conclusion, these results suggest a wide range of mechanisms involved in altering colonic metabolism during the early stage of carcinogenesis and a strong influence of low-molar-mass oat beta-glucan, administered as dietary supplement, in modulating these mechanisms.","2024","2024 Apr 24","Jacek Wilczak; Adam Prostek; Katarzyna Dziendzikowska; Małgorzata Gajewska; Łukasz Kopiasz; Joanna Harasym; Michał Oczkowski; Joanna Gromadzka-Ostrowska","Department of Physiological Sciences, Institute of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, 02-776 Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Physiological Sciences, Institute of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, 02-776 Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Dietetics, Institute of Human Nutrition Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, 02-776 Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Physiological Sciences, Institute of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, 02-776 Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Dietetics, Institute of Human Nutrition Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, 02-776 Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Biotechnology and Food Analysis, Wroclaw University of Economics and Business, 53-345 Wroclaw, Poland.; Department of Dietetics, Institute of Human Nutrition Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, 02-776 Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Dietetics, Institute of Human Nutrition Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, 02-776 Warsaw, Poland."

In particular, patients with recurrent IBD present an increased risk of developing colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). The role and molecular mechanism of BHB in the inflammatory and carcinogenic process of CAC remains unclear. Here, the anti-tumor effect of BHB was investigated in the Azoxymethane (AOM)/Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-induced CAC model and tumor organoids derivatives. The underlying mechanisms were studied using transcriptome and non-target metabolomic assay and further validated in colon tumor cell lineage CT26 in vitro. The tumor tissues and the nearby non-malignant tissues from colon cancer patients were collected to measure the expression levels of ketogenic enzymes. The exogenous BHB supplement lightened tumor burden and angiogenesis in the CAC model. Notably, transcriptome analysis revealed that BHB effectively decreased the expression of VEGFA in the CAC tumor mucosa. In vitro, BHB directly reduced VEGFA expression in hypoxic-treated CT26 cells by targeting transcriptional factor HIF-1α. Conversely, the deletion of HIF-1α largely reversed the inhibitory effect of BHB on CAC tumorigenesis. Additionally, decreased expression of ketogenesis-related enzymes in tumor tissues were associated with poor survival outcomes in patients with colon cancer. In summary, BHB carries out anti-angiogenic activity in CAC by regulating HIF-1α/VEGFA signaling.

Metabolite quantitative trait loci were derived from 2 published metabolomics genome-wide association studies, and summary-level data were extracted for 651 plasma metabolites and 208 urinary metabolites. Genetic associations with CRC were obtained from a large-scale genome-wide association study meta-analysis (100 204 cases, 154 587 controls) and the FinnGen cohort (4957 cases, 304 197 controls). Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses were performed to evaluate the causal roles of metabolites in CRC. Druggability evaluation was employed to prioritize potential therapeutic targets. Multivariable Mendelian randomization and mediation estimation were conducted to elucidate the mediating effects of metabolites on the associations between modifiable risk factors and CRC. The study identified 30 plasma metabolites and 4 urinary metabolites for CRC. Plasma sphingomyelin and urinary lactose, which were positively associated with CRC risk, could be modulated by drug interventions (ie, olipudase alfa, tilactase). Thirteen modifiable risk factors were associated with 9 metabolites, and 8 of these modifiable risk factors were associated with CRC risk. These 9 metabolites mediated the effect of modifiable risk factors (Actinobacteria, body mass index, waist to hip ratio, fasting insulin, smoking initiation) on CRC. This study identified key metabolite biomarkers associated with CRC and elucidated their mediator roles in the associations between modifiable risk factors and CRC. These findings provide new insights into the etiology and potential therapeutic targets for CRC and the etiological pathways of modifiable environmental factors with CRC.","2024","2024 Aug 01","Jing Sun; Jianhui Zhao; Siyun Zhou; Xinxuan Li; Tengfei Li; Lijuan Wang; Shuai Yuan; Dong Chen; Philip J Law; Susanna C Larsson; Susan M Farrington; Richard S Houlston; Malcolm G Dunlop; Evropi Theodoratou; Xue Li","Department of Big Data in Health Science School of Public Health, and Center of Clinical Big Data and Analytics of The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; Department of Big Data in Health Science School of Public Health, and Center of Clinical Big Data and Analytics of The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; Department of Big Data in Health Science School of Public Health, and Center of Clinical Big Data and Analytics of The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; Department of Big Data in Health Science School of Public Health, and Center of Clinical Big Data and Analytics of The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; Department of Big Data in Health Science School of Public Health, and Center of Clinical Big Data and Analytics of The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Unit of Cardiovascular and Nutritional Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Colorectal Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.; Unit of Cardiovascular and Nutritional Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Unit of Medical Epidemiology, Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Medical Research Council Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.; Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Medical Research Council Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Colon Cancer Genetics Group, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Colon Cancer Genetics Group, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Department of Big Data in Health Science School of Public Health, and Center of Clinical Big Data and Analytics of The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."

As an edible algae-derived polysaccharide, exploring the role of colon cancer can better develop the application from a dietary therapy perspective. However, more in-depth studies of C. lentillifera polysaccharide on anti-colon cancer activity and mechanism are needed. In this study, we found that Caulerpa lentillifera polysaccharides (CLP) showed potential anti-colon cancer effect on human colon cancer cell HT29 in monolayer (IC50 = 1.954 mg/mL) and spheroid (IC50 = 0.402 mg/mL). Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses revealed that CLP had an inhibitory effect on HT29 3D spheroid cells by activating aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis as well as arginine and proline metabolism pathways. Furthermore, the anti-colon cancer effects of CLP were confirmed through other human colon cancer cell HCT116 and LoVo in monolayer cells (IC50 = 1.890 mg/mL and 1.437 mg/mL, respectively) and 3D spheroid cells (IC50 = 0.344 mg/mL and 0.975 mg/mL, respectively), and three patient-derived organoids with IC50 values of 6.333-8.780 mg/mL.

Essential oils isolated from Calocedrus formosana (CF-EOs) have been shown to demonstrate anti-termite, antifungal, anti-mosquito, and anti-microbial activities. However, the anticancer effects of CF-EOs are not yet fully understood. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism underlying CF-EOs-mediated anti-proliferative activity in colon cancer cells. Here, cell impedance measurements showed that CF-EOs inhibit proliferation in colon cancer cells with wild-type or mutant p53. Flow cytometry revealed that CF-EOs at 20, 50 µg/mL significantly induced ROS generation and autophagy in both HCT116 p53-wt and HCT116 p53-null cell lines, whereas pretreatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) markedly attenuated these changes. CF-EOs also induced apoptosis at 50 µg/mL in both lines, as determined by flow cytometry. Protein analysis showed that CF-EOs markedly induced apoptosis markers, including Trail, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved PARP, as well as autophagy markers, such as the levels of ULK1, Atg5, Atg6, Atg7, and the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. CF-EOs were further found to inhibit the activity and expression of the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 to increase the levels of acetylated p53 (Ac-p53) in p53-wt cells and acetylated c-Myc (Ac-c-Myc) in p53-null cells, ultimately inducing apoptosis in both lines. Interestingly, suppression of SIRT1 by CF-EOs enhanced the acetylation of ULK1, which in turn prompted ROS-dependent autophagy in colon cancer cells. The induction of apoptosis and autophagy by CF-EOs suggests that they may have potential as a promising new approach for treating cancer. Collectively, our results suggest that essential oils isolated from Calocedrus formosana act as a promising anticancer agent against colon cancer cells by targeting SIRT1 to induce ROS-mediated autophagy and apoptosis.","2024","2024 Feb 26","Atikul Islam; Yu-Chun Chang; Nai-Wen Tsao; Sheng-Yang Wang; Pin Ju Chueh","Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.; Special Crop and Metabolome Discipline Cluster, Academy Circle Economy, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung City 402202, Taiwan.; Department of Forestry, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Basic Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40402, Taiwan."

As a result, there is an urgent need to develop drugs that have a good chemotherapy effect while also being extremely safe. In this study, we found cafestol inhibited colon cancer growth and HCT116 proliferation in vivo and in vitro, and improved the composition of intestinal flora. Further metabolomic data showed that autophagy and AMPK pathways were involved in the process of cafestol's anti-colon cancer effects. The functional validation studies revealed that cafestol increased autophagy vesicles and LC3B-II levels. The autophagic flux induced by cafestol was prevented by using BafA1. The autophagy inhibitor 3-MA blocked the cafestol-induced increase in LC3B-II and cell proliferation inhibition. Then we found that cafestol induced the increased expressions of LKB1, AMPK, ULK1, p-LKB1, p-AMPK, and p-ULK1 proteins in vivo and in vitro. Using the siRNA targeted to the Lkb1 gene, the levels of AMPK, ULK1, and LC3B-II were suppressed under cafestol treatment. These results indicated that the effect of cafestol is through regulating LKB1/AMPK/ULK1 pathway-mediated autophagic death. Finally, a correlation matrix of the microbiome and autophagy-related proteins was conducted. We found that cafestol-induced autophagic protein expression was positively correlated with the beneficial intestinal bacteria (Muribaculaceae, Bacteroides, Prevotellacece, and Alloprevotella) and negatively correlated with the hazardous bacteria. Conclusions: This study found that cafestol inhibited colon cancer in vitro and in vivo by the mechanism that may be related to LKB1/AMPK/ULK1 pathway-mediated autophagic cell death and improved intestinal microenvironment.","2024","2024 Jul","Yuemei Feng; JiZhuo Yang; Yihan Wang; Xue Wang; Qian Ma; Yalin Li; Xuehui Zhang; Songmei Wang; Qiao Zhang; Fei Mi; Yanjiao Wang; Dubo Zhong; Jianzhong Yin","Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Food Safety of Yunnan Provincial Education Department, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China; Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Health and Biosafety & School of Public Health, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China; Key Laboratory of Public Health & Disease Prevention and Control of Yunnan Provincial Education Department, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China.

Using spatial metabolomic profiling technologies and 16SrRNA sequencing, we herein report that right-sided colorectal tumors are predominantly populated with Colibactin-producing Escherichia coli (CoPEC) that are locally establishing a high-glycerophospholipid microenvironment with lowered immunogenicity. It coincided with a reduced infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes that produce the cytotoxic cytokines IFN-γ where invading bacteria have been geolocated. Mechanistically, the accumulation of lipid droplets in infected cancer cells relied on the production of colibactin as a measure to limit genotoxic stress to some extent. Such heightened phosphatidylcholine remodeling by the enzyme of the Land's cycle supplied CoPEC-infected cancer cells with sufficient energy for sustaining cell survival in response to chemotherapies. This accords with the lowered overall survival of colorectal patients at stage III-IV who were colonized by CoPEC when compared to patients at stage I-II. Accordingly, the sensitivity of CoPEC-infected cancer cells to chemotherapies was restored upon treatment with an acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor. By contrast, such metabolic dysregulation leading to chemoresistance was not observed in human colon cancer cells that were infected with the mutant strain that did not produce colibactin (11G5∆ClbQ). This work revealed that CoPEC locally supports an energy trade-off lipid overload within tumors for lowering tumor immunogenicity. This may pave the way for improving chemoresistance and subsequently outcome of CRC patients who are colonized by CoPEC.","2024","2024 Jan-Dec","Nilmara de Oliveira Alves; Guillaume Dalmasso; Darja Nikitina; Amaury Vaysse; Richard Ruez; Lea Ledoux; Thierry Pedron; Emma Bergsten; Olivier Boulard; Lora Autier; Sofian Allam; Laurence Motreff; Pierre Sauvanet; Diane Letourneur; Pragya Kashyap; Johan Gagnière; Denis Pezet; Catherine Godfraind; Michel Salzet; Emmanuel Lemichez; Mathilde Bonnet; Imène Najjar; Christophe Malabat; Marc Monot; Denis Mestivier; Nicolas Barnich; Pankaj Yadav; Isabelle Fournier; Sean Kennedy; Amel Mettouchi; Richard Bonnet; Iradj Sobhani; Mathias Chamaillard","ONCOLille, INSERM, Phycell, University of Lille, Lille, France.; Microbes, Intestin, Inflammation et Susceptibilité de l'Hôte (M2iSH), Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Auvergne, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.; CNRS, Institute Pasteur, Paris, France.; Laboratory of Clinical and Molecular Gastroenterology, Institute for Digestive Research, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Kaunas, Lithuania.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Hub, Plate-Forme Technologique Biomics, Paris, France.; ONCOLille, INSERM, Phycell, University of Lille, Lille, France.; Réponse Inflammatoire et Spectrométrie de Masse-PRISM, University of Lille, Lille, France.; Institut Pasteur, Inserm, Paris, France.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; ONCOLille, INSERM, Phycell, University of Lille, Lille, France.; ONCOLille, INSERM, Phycell, University of Lille, Lille, France.; ONCOLille, INSERM, Phycell, University of Lille, Lille, France.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Hub, Plate-Forme Technologique Biomics, Paris, France.; Microbes, Intestin, Inflammation et Susceptibilité de l'Hôte (M2iSH), Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Auvergne, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Department of Bioscience & Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India.; Microbes, Intestin, Inflammation et Susceptibilité de l'Hôte (M2iSH), Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Auvergne, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.; Microbes, Intestin, Inflammation et Susceptibilité de l'Hôte (M2iSH), Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Auvergne, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.; Microbes, Intestin, Inflammation et Susceptibilité de l'Hôte (M2iSH), Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Auvergne, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.; Réponse Inflammatoire et Spectrométrie de Masse-PRISM, University of Lille, Lille, France.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Microbes, Intestin, Inflammation et Susceptibilité de l'Hôte (M2iSH), Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Auvergne, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Hub, Plate-Forme Technologique Biomics, Paris, France.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Hub, Plate-Forme Technologique Biomics, Paris, France.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Hub, Plate-Forme Technologique Biomics, Paris, France.; Université Paris Est Créteil, Créteil, France.; Microbes, Intestin, Inflammation et Susceptibilité de l'Hôte (M2iSH), Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Auvergne, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.; Department of Bioscience & Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India.; Réponse Inflammatoire et Spectrométrie de Masse-PRISM, University of Lille, Lille, France.; CNRS, Institute Pasteur, Paris, France.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Microbes, Intestin, Inflammation et Susceptibilité de l'Hôte (M2iSH), Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Auvergne, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.; Université Paris Est Créteil, Créteil, France.; Service de Gastroentérologie CHU Henri Mondor, Assistance Publique des Hôpitaux de Paris-APHP, Créteil, France.; ONCOLille, INSERM, Phycell, University of Lille, Lille, France."

Bulbs, used for culinary purposes, have been largely investigated for their medicinal properties whereas aerial bulbils are usually removed as waste material. Here, for the first time, chemical composition and biological properties of the hydroalcoholic extract from aerial bulbils were investigated. Complementary information on metabolite composition were obtained using both NMR based untargeted and HPLC-DAD targeted methodologies. The NMR analysis revealed the presence of sugars, organic acids, amino acids, organosulphur compounds (methiin, alliin, allicin and cycloalliin), and other secondary metabolites. In particular, methiin and alliin were identified for the first time in the NMR spectra of aerial bulbil garlic extracts. Polyphenol content was determined by HPLC-DAD analysis: catechin, chlorogenic acid, and gallic acid turned out to be the most abundant phenolics. Hydroalcoholic extract blocked cell proliferation of colon cancer cell line HCT116 with an IC50 of 352.07 µg/mL, while it was non-toxic to myoblast cell line C2C12. In addition, it caused seedling germination reduction of two edible and herbaceous dicotyledon species, namely Cichorium intybus and C. endivia. Moreover, the same extract reduced the gene expression of TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor), HIF1-α (hypoxia-inducible factor), VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor), and transient receptor potential (TRP) M8 (TRPM8) indicating the ability to contrast cancer development through the angiogenic pathway. Final, in silico experiments were also carried out supporting the biological effects of organosulphur compounds, particularly alliin, which may directly interact with TRPM8. The results here reported suggest the potential use of garlic aerial bulbils often considered a waste product as a source in phytotherapeutic remedies.","2024","2024 Jan","Annalisa Chiavaroli; Fabrizio Masciulli; Cinzia Ingallina; Luisa Mannina; Maria Loreta Libero; Simonetta Cristina Di Simone; Alessandra Acquaviva; Nilofar; Lucia Recinella; Sheila Leone; Luigi Brunetti; Simone Carradori; Luca Cantò; Giustino Orlando; Gokhan Zengin; Abdullah Ibrahim Uba; Ugur Cakilcioğlu; Muzaffer Mukemre; Omer Elkiran; Maura Di Vito; Luigi Menghini; Claudio Ferrante","Department of Pharmacy, G. d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara, Chieti, Italy.

To investigate whether changes in circulating metabolites characterize the early stages of colorectal cancer (CRC) development, we examined the associations between a genetic risk score (GRS) associated with CRC liability (72 single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and 231 circulating metabolites measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N = 6221). Linear regression models were applied to examine the associations between genetic liability to CRC and circulating metabolites measured in the same individuals at age 8 y, 16 y, 18 y, and 25 y. The GRS for CRC was associated with up to 28% of the circulating metabolites at FDR-P < 0.05 across all time points, particularly with higher fatty acids and very-low- and low-density lipoprotein subclass lipids. Two-sample reverse Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses investigating CRC liability (52,775 cases, 45,940 controls) and metabolites measured in a random subset of UK Biobank participants (N = 118,466, median age 58 y) revealed broadly consistent effect estimates with the GRS analysis. In conventional (forward) MR analyses, genetically predicted polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations were most strongly associated with higher CRC risk. These analyses suggest that higher genetic liability to CRC can cause early alterations in systemic metabolism and suggest that fatty acids may play an important role in CRC development.

Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is a key enzyme in the lipogenesis pathway that is upregulated in many cancers and has gained popularity as a druggable target of interest for cancer treatment. The first FAS inhibitor discovered, cerulenin, initially showed promise for chemotherapeutic purposes until it was observed that it had adverse side effects in mice. TVB-2640 (Denifanstat) is part of the newer generation of inhibitors. With multiple generations of FAS inhibitors being developed, it is vital to understand their distinct molecular downstream effects to elucidate potential interactions in the clinic. Here, we profile the lipidome of two different colorectal cancer (CRC) spheroids treated with a generation 1 inhibitor (cerulenin) or a generation 2 inhibitor (TVB-2640). We observe that the cerulenin causes drastic changes to the spheroid morphology as well as alterations to the lipid droplets found within CRC spheroids. TVB-2640 causes higher abundances of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) whereas cerulenin causes a decreased abundance of PUFAs. The increase in PUFAs in TVB-2640 exposed spheroids indicates it is causing cells to die via a ferroptotic mechanism rather than a conventional apoptotic or necrotic mechanism.","2024","2024 Aug 02","Brian D Fries; Fernando Tobias; Yijia Wang; Joseph H Holbrook; Amanda B Hummon","Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.; Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, United States.; Integrated Molecular Structure Education and Research Center (IMSERC), Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, United States.; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.; Ohio State Biochemistry Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.; Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States."

Vincristine (VCR) is a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug. Celastrol (CEL) is an effective component which exerts inhibitory effects on colon cancer. Combination treatment improves resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and enhances their efficacy. Therefore, we aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of VCR combined with CEL in colon cancer treatment. We verified the effects of VCR combined with CEL on the proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of HCT-8 cells. Non-targeted metabolomic techniques were used to analyse the changes in cellular metabolites after administration. Finally, network pharmacology technology was used to screen the potential targets and pathways. VCR combined with CEL had synergistic inhibitory effects on HCT-8 colon cancer cells. Cell metabolomics identified 12 metabolites enriched in metabolic pathways, such as the phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathways. Network pharmacology revealed that MAPK1, AKT1, PIK3CB, EGFR, and VEGFA were the key targets. Western blotting revealed that VCR combined with CEL activated the P53 pathway by suppressing the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway activation and Bcl-2 expression, promoting the Bax expression. Therefore, VCR combined with CEL potentially treats colon cancer by increasing the apoptosis, improving energy metabolism, and inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway in colon cancer cells.","2024","2024 Feb 15","Jin-Yu Ning; Bo Ma; Jing-Yi Huang; Liang Han; Yan-Hua Shao; Feng-Yun Wang","School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, The East Division of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510700, China.; School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.; School of Health, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.; School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.; School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.

In this study, we identify a neoepitope, resulting from a mutation in the junction plakoglobin (Jup) gene (chromosome 11), from the mouse colon cancer line MC38-FABF (C57BL/6). This neoepitope, Jup mutant (JupMUT), was detected during mass spectrometry of MHC class I-eluted peptides from the tumor. JupMUT has a predicted binding affinity of 564 nM for the Kb molecule and a higher predicted affinity of 82 nM for Db. However, whereas structural modeling of JupMUT and its unmutated counterpart Jup wild-type indicates that there are little conformational differences between the two epitopes bound to Db, large structural divergences are predicted between the two epitopes bound to Kb. Together with in vitro binding data with RMA-S cells, these data suggest that Kb rather than Db is the relevant MHC class I molecule of JupMUT. Immunization of naive C57BL/6 mice with JupMUT elicits CD8-dependent tumor control of a MC38-FABF challenge. Despite the CD8 dependence of JupMUT-mediated tumor control in vivo, CD8+ T cells from JupMUT-immunized mice do not produce higher levels of IFN-γ than do naive mice. The structural and immunological characteristics of JupMUT are substantially different from those of many other neoepitopes that have been shown to mediate tumor control.","2023","2023 Dec 15","Marc A Gillig; Cory A Brennick; Mariam M George; Jeremy L Balsbaugh; Tatiana V Shcheglova; Ion I Mandoiu; Tatiana Rosales; Brian M Baker; Pramod K Srivastava; Sukrut H Karandikar","Department of Immunology, Carole and Ray Neag Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT.; Department of Immunology, Carole and Ray Neag Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT.; Department of Immunology, Carole and Ray Neag Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT.; Proteomics and Metabolomics Facility, Center for Open Research Resources and Equipment, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT.; Department of Immunology, Carole and Ray Neag Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT.; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Harper Cancer Research Institute, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN.; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Harper Cancer Research Institute, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN.; Department of Immunology, Carole and Ray Neag Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT.; Department of Immunology, Carole and Ray Neag Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT."

The goal of the study was to detect metabolic biomarkers in patients with colon cancer using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This study consisted of 30 patients with colon cancer. An analysis of the metabolomes of cancer samples and para-carcinoma tissues was conducted. We identified a series of important metabolic changes in colon cancer by analyzing metabolites in cancerous tissues compared to their normal counterparts. They are mainly involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, the TCA cycle, glycolysis, galactose metabolism, and butanoate metabolism. As well, we observed dysregulation of AMP, dTMP, fructose, and D-glucose in colon cancer. Additionally, the AUCs for AMP, dTMP, fructose, and D-glucose were greater than 0.7 for the diagnosis of colon cancer. In conclusion, AMP, dTMP, fructose, and D-glucose showed excellent diagnostic performance and could serve as novel disease biomarkers for colon cancer diagnosis.","2023","2023 Sep 30","Weisi Yuan; Yinxing Chen; Dan Zhuang; Hong Zeng; Xihua Lin; Sigeng Hong; Fang Lin; Xiuna Chen; Shucan Huang; Fen Lin","Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Chaozhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Chaozhou, Guangdong, 521000, China. 13829011177@163.com.; Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Chaozhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Chaozhou, Guangdong, 521000, China. 413673467@qq.com.; Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Chaozhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Chaozhou, Guangdong, 521000, China. czzd2012@163.com.; Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Chaozhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Chaozhou, Guangdong, 521000, China. 55102336@qq.com.; Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Chaozhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Chaozhou, Guangdong, 521000, China. czzx-linxihan@163.com.; Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Chaozhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Chaozhou, Guangdong, 521000, China. hsg_hello@163.com.; Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Chaozhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Chaozhou, Guangdong, 521000, China. 419616595@qq.com.; Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Chaozhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Chaozhou, Guangdong, 521000, China. 2871518740@qq.com.; Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Chaozhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Chaozhou, Guangdong, 521000, China. 708943289@qq.com.; Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Chaozhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Chaozhou, Guangdong, 521000, China. dearyws@163.com."

Here, we report a decrease in B vitamin-related liver enzymes as a hallmark of systemic metabolic changes occurring in cancer cachexia. Metabolomics of multiple mouse models highlights cachexia-associated reductions of niacin, vitamin B6, and a glycine-related subset of one-carbon (C1) metabolites in the liver. Integration of proteomics and metabolomics reveals that liver enzymes related to niacin, vitamin B6, and glycine-related C1 enzymes dependent on B vitamins decrease linearly with their associated metabolites, likely reflecting stoichiometric cofactor-enzyme interactions. The decrease of B vitamin-related enzymes is also found to depend on protein abundance and cofactor subtype. These metabolic/proteomic changes and decreased protein malonylation, another cachexia feature identified by protein post-translational modification analysis, are reflected in blood samples from mouse models and gastric cancer patients with cachexia, underscoring the clinical relevance of our findings.","2023","2023 Oct 06","Yasushi Kojima; Emi Mishiro-Sato; Teruaki Fujishita; Kiyotoshi Satoh; Rie Kajino-Sakamoto; Isao Oze; Kazuki Nozawa; Yukiya Narita; Takatsugu Ogata; Keitaro Matsuo; Kei Muro; Makoto Mark Taketo; Tomoyoshi Soga; Masahiro Aoki","Division of Pathophysiology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8681, Japan. ykojima@aichi-cc.jp.; Division of Pathophysiology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8681, Japan.; Division of Pathophysiology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8681, Japan.; Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, 246-2 Mizukami, Kakuganji, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, 997-0052, Japan.; Division of Pathophysiology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8681, Japan.; Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8681, Japan.; Department of Clinical Oncology, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8681, Japan.; Department of Clinical Oncology, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8681, Japan.; Department of Clinical Oncology, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8681, Japan.; Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8681, Japan.; Department of Clinical Oncology, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8681, Japan.; Colon Cancer Project, Kyoto University Hospital-iACT, Kyoto University, Yoshida-Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan.; Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, 246-2 Mizukami, Kakuganji, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, 997-0052, Japan.; Division of Pathophysiology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8681, Japan. msaoki@aichi-cc.jp.; Department of Cancer Physiology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8550, Japan. msaoki@aichi-cc.jp."

In this study, we first confirmed the inhibitory effect of A. muciniphila on CRC formation and analyzed the metabolic role of intestinal flora in human Polyps, A-CRA (advanced colorectal adenoma) and CRC samples. To better clarify the role of A. muciniphila in CRC development, a pseudo-germ-free (GF) azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse model was established, followed by infection with or without A. muciniphila. Metabolomic analysis and RNA-seq analysis showed tryptophan-mediated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) was significantly down-regulated in A. muciniphila-infected CRC mice. Then, mice with intestinal specific AhR deficiency (AhRfl/fl Cre) were generated and were used in 2 murine models: AOM/DSS treatment as a model of carcinogen-induced colon cancer and a genetically induced model using ApcMin/+ mice. Notably, AhR deficiency inhibited CRC growth in the AOM/DSS and ApcMin/+ mouse model. Moreover, AhR deficiency inhibited, rather than enhanced, tumor formation and tumor-derived organoids in Apc-deficient cells both in vivo and in vitro by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and TCF4/LEF1-dependent transcription. Furthermore, the antitumor effectiveness of A. muciniphila was abolished either in a human colon cancer tumor model induced by subcutaneous transplantation of AhR-silenced CRC cells, or AhR-deficienty spontaneous colorectal cancer model.

The development of new therapies, especially herbal medicines, has received much global attention. Dorema ammoniacum is a medicinal plant. Its gum is used in healing known ailments. Studying metabolome profiles based on nuclear magnetic resonance 1HNMR as a non-invasive and reproducible tool can identify metabolic changes as a reflection of intracellular fluxes, especially in drug responses. This study aimed to investigate the anti-cancer effects of different gum extracts on metabolic changes and their impact on gene expression in HT-29 cell. Extraction of Dorema ammoniacum gum with hexane, chloroform, and dichloromethane organic solvents was performed. Cell inhibition growth percentage and IC50 were assessed. Following treating the cells with dichloromethane extract, p53, APC, and KRAS gene expression were determined. 1HNMR spectroscopy was conducted. Eventually, systems biology software tools interpreted combined metabolites and genes simultaneously. The lowest determined IC50 concentration was related to dichloromethane solvent, and the highest was hexane and chloroform. The expression of the KRAS oncogene gene decreased significantly after treatment with dichloromethane extract compared to the control group, and the expression of tumor suppressor gene p53 and APC increased significantly. Most gene-altered convergent metabolic phenotypes. This study's results indicate that the dichloromethane solvent of Dorema ammoniacum gum exhibits its antitumor properties by altering the expression of genes involved in HT-29 cells and the consequent change in downstream metabolic reprogramming.","2023","2023 Apr","Elham Ghodousi-Dehnavi; Mohammad Arjmand; Ziba Akbari; Mansour Aminzadeh; Reza Haji Hosseini","Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Payame Noor University, Tehran, Iran.; Metabolomics Lab.

Although early screenings and advances in treatments have reduced mortality since 1970, identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention is needed to address tumor heterogeneity and recurrence. Previous work identified aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1 (ALDH1B1) as a critical factor in colon tumorigenesis. To investigate further, we utilized a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (SW480) in which the ALDH1B1 protein expression has been knocked down by 80% via shRNA. Through multi-omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, and untargeted metabolomics) analysis, we identified the impact of ALDH1B1 knocking down (KD) on molecular signatures in colon cancer cells. Suppression of ALDH1B1 expression resulted in 357 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 191 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and 891 differentially altered metabolites (DAMs). Functional annotation and enrichment analyses revealed that: (1) DEGs were enriched in integrin-linked kinase (ILK) signaling and growth and development pathways; (2) DEPs were mainly involved in apoptosis signaling and cellular stress response pathways; and (3) DAMs were associated with biosynthesis, intercellular and second messenger signaling.

However, the metabolic changes and underlying molecular mechanisms during cachexia progression remain poorly understood. Understanding the progression of CAC is crucial for developing diagnostic approaches to distinguish between CAC and NCAC stages, facilitating appropriate treatment for cancer patients. In this study, we establish a mouse model of colon CAC and categorize the mice into three groups: CAC, NCAC and normal control (NOR). By performing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomic profiling on mouse sera, we elucidate the metabolic properties of these groups. Our findings unveil significant differences in the metabolic profiles among the CAC, NCAC and NOR groups, highlighting significant impairments in energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism during cachexia progression. Additionally, we observe the elevated serum levels of lysine and acetate during the transition from the NCAC to CAC stages. Using multivariate ROC analysis, we identify lysine and acetate as potential biomarkers for distinguishing between CAC and NCAC stages. These biomarkers hold promise for the diagnosis of CAC from noncachexia cancer.

Probiotics are extensively perceived as a potential microbiota-modulation strategy to promote the health of the host, while the effectiveness of preventing colon cancer based on microbiota therapy has not been confirmed, and antitumor mechanisms influenced by microbiota and their metabolites with the intervention of probiotics remain to be further investigated. In vitro, Lactobacillus (JY300-8 and JMR-01) significantly inhibited the proliferation of CT26, HT29, and HCT116 cells. Moreover, we studied the prevention and therapy efficiency of Lactobacillus and its underlying antitumor mechanism through the alteration of gut microbiota and their metabolites regulated by Lactobacillus in colon cancer models in mice. We demonstrated that the pre-administration of Lactobacillus (JY300-8 and JMR-01) for 20 days before establishing tumor models resulted in an 86.21% reduction in tumor formation rate compared to tumor control group. Subsequently, continuous oral administration of living Lactobacillus significantly suppresses tumor growth, and tumor volumes decrease by 65.2%. Microbiome and metabolome analyses reveal that Lactobacillus suppresses colonic tumorigenesis and progression through the modulation of gut microbiota homeostasis and metabolites, including the down-regulation of secondary bile acids, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and pyrimidine metabolism, as well as the production of anticarcinogenic compounds in tumor-bearing mice. Additionally, metabolome analyses of Lactobacillus (JY300-8 and JMR-01) indicate that living Lactobacillus could reduce the relative abundance of alanine and L-serine to suppress tumor progression by regulating the tumor microenvironment, including down-regulation of pyrimidine metabolism and S1P signaling in cancer. These findings provide a potential prevention strategy and therapeutic target for colon cancer through the intervention of dietary Lactobacillus. IMPORTANCE The modulation of gut microbiota and metabolites has a significant influence on the progression of colon cancer. Our research indicated that the intervention of probiotics is a potentially feasible strategy for preventing colon cancer.

However, despite decades of research on tryptophan metabolism, the metabolic regulatory roles of it and its metabolites are not well understood. To address this, we performed an activity metabolomics screen of tryptophan and most of its known metabolites in cell culture. We discovered that treatment of human colon cancer cells (HCT116) with 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), a metabolite of kynurenine, potently disrupted TCA cycle function. Citrate and aconitate levels were increased, while isocitrate and all downstream TCA metabolites were decreased, suggesting decreased aconitase function. We hypothesized that 3HK or one of its metabolites increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibited aconitase activity. Accordingly, we observed almost complete depletion of reduced glutathione and a decrease in total glutathione levels. We observed a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability after 48 hours of 3HK treatment. These data suggest that raising the intracellular levels of 3HK could be sufficient to induce ROS-mediated apoptosis. We modulated the intracellular levels of 3HK by combined induction of IDO and knockdown of kynureninase (KYNU) in HCT116 cells. Cell viability decreased significantly after 48 hours of KYNU knockdown compared to controls, which was accompanied by increased ROS production and Annexin V staining revealing apoptosis. Finally, we identify xanthommatin production from 3-HK as a candidate radical-producing, cytotoxic mechanism. Our work indicates that KYNU may be a target for disrupting tryptophan metabolism. Interestingly, many cancers exhibit overexpression of IDO, providing a cancer-specific metabolic vulnerability that could be exploited by KYNU inhibition.","2023","2023 Jul 10","Jane L Buchanan; Adam J Rauckhorst; Eric B Taylor","Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52240, USA.; Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52240, USA.; FOEDRC Metabolomics Core Research Facility, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52240, USA.; Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52240, USA.; Fraternal Order of Eagles Diabetes Research Center (FOEDRC), University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52240, USA.; FOEDRC Metabolomics Core Research Facility, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52240, USA.; Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52240, USA.; Abboud Cardiovascular Research Center, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52240, USA.; Pappajohn Biomedical Institute, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52240, USA."

Male BALB/C mice were randomly divided into a normal group, a model group, a 5-FU group, and a 5-FU + BSP group, with eight mice in each group. Mouse colon cancer cells(CT26) were transplanted into the mice except for those in the normal group to construct the tumor-bearing mouse model by subcutaneous injection, and 5-FU chemotherapy and BSP treatment were carried out from the second day of modeling. The changes in body weight, diarrhea, and white blood cell count in the peripheral blood were recorded. The mice were sacrificed and sampled when the tumor weight of mice in the model group reached approximately 1 g. TUNEL staining was used to detect the cell apoptosis in the small intestine of each group. The proportions of hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitor cells in bone marrow were measured by flow cytometry. Five serum samples were selected randomly from each group for untargeted metabolomics analysis. The results showed that BSP was not effective in inhibiting colon cancer in mice, but diarrhea, leukopenia, and weight loss caused by 5-FU chemotherapy were significantly improved after BSP intervention. In addition, apoptotic cells decreased in the small intestinal tissues and the percentages of hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitor cells in bone marrow were significantly higher after BSP treatment. Metabolomics results showed that the toxic and side effects of 5-FU resulted in significant decrease in 29 metabolites and significant increase in 22 metabolites in mouse serum. Among them, 19 disordered metabolites showed a return to normal levels in the 5-FU+BSP group. The results of pathway enrichment indicated that metabolic pathways mainly involved pyrimidine metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis.

Although recent studies highlight the role of individual taxa, the effect of a complex gut microbiome (GM) on the metabolome and host transcriptome is still unknown. We used a multi-omics approach to determine how differences in the GM affect the susceptibility to adenoma development in a rat model of human colon cancer. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry of feces collected prior to observable disease onset identified putative metabolite profiles that likely predict future disease severity. Transcriptome analyses performed after disease onset from normal colonic epithelium and tumor tissues show a correlation between GM and host gene expression. Integrated pathway analyses of the metabolome and transcriptome based on putatively identified metabolic features indicate that bile acid biosynthesis is enriched in rats with high tumors along with increased fatty acid metabolism and mucin biosynthesis. Targeted pyrosequencing of the Pirc allele indicates that the GM alters the mechanism of adenoma development and may drive an epigenetic pathway of tumor suppressor silencing. This study reveals how untargeted metabolomics identifies signatures of susceptibility and integrated analyses uncover pathways of differential mechanisms of loss of tumor suppressor gene function and for potential prevention and therapeutic intervention. IMPORTANCE The association between the gut microbiome and colon cancer is significant but difficult to test in model systems. This study highlights the association of differences in the pathogen-free gut microbiome to changes in the host transcriptome and metabolome that correlate with colon adenoma initiation and development in a rat genetic model of early colon cancer. The utilization of a multi-omics approach integrating metabolomics and transcriptomics reveals differences in pathways including bile acid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism. The study also shows that differences in gut microbiomes significantly alter the mechanism of adenoma formation, shifting from genetic changes to epigenetic changes that initiate the early loss of tumor suppressor function. These findings enhance our understanding of the gut microbiome's role in colon cancer susceptibility, offer insights into potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and may pave the way for future prevention and intervention strategies.","2023","2023 Aug 31","Susheel Bhanu Busi; Zhentian Lei; Lloyd W Sumner; James M Amos-Landgraf","University of Missouri School of Medicine , Columbia, Missouri, USA.; Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg , Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.; Department of Biochemistry, University of Missouri , Columbia, Missouri, USA.; University of Missouri Metabolomics Center , Columbia, Missouri, USA.; Department of Biochemistry, University of Missouri , Columbia, Missouri, USA.; University of Missouri Metabolomics Center , Columbia, Missouri, USA.; University of Missouri School of Medicine , Columbia, Missouri, USA.; University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine , Columbia, Missouri, USA.; Rat Resource and Research Center, University of Missouri , Columbia, Missouri, USA."

No studies have prospectively examined associations of blood metabolite concentrations with all-cause mortality in patients with colon and rectal cancer separately. Targeted metabolomics (Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180) and pathway analyses (MetaboAnalyst 4.0) were performed on pre-surgery collected plasma from 674 patients with non-metastasized (stage I-III) colon (n = 394) or rectal cancer (n = 283). Metabolomics data and covariate information were received from the international cohort consortium MetaboCCC. Cox proportional hazards models were computed to investigate associations of 148 metabolite levels with all-cause mortality adjusted for age, sex, tumor stage, tumor site (whenever applicable), and cohort; the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to account for multiple testing. A total of 93 patients (14%) were deceased after an average follow-up time of 4.4 years (60 patients with colon cancer and 33 patients with rectal cancer). After FDR adjustment, higher plasma creatinine was associated with a 39% increase in all-cause mortality in patients with rectal cancer. HR: 1.39, 95% CI 1.23-1.72, pFDR = 0.03; but not colon cancer: pFDR = 0.96. Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle and may reflect changes in skeletal muscle mass. The starch and sucrose metabolisms were associated with increased all-cause mortality in colon cancer but not in rectal cancer. Genes in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathways were previously linked to worse clinical outcomes in CRC. In summary, our findings support the hypothesis that colon and rectal cancer have different etiological and clinical outcomes that need to be considered for targeted treatments.","2023","2023 Jun 28","Jennifer Ose; Biljana Gigic; Stefanie Brezina; Tengda Lin; Anita R Peoples; Pauline P Schobert; Andreas Baierl; Eline van Roekel; Nivonirina Robinot; Audrey Gicquiau; David Achaintre; Augustin Scalbert; Fränzel J B van Duijnhoven; Andreana N Holowatyj; Tanja Gumpenberger; Petra Schrotz-King; Alexis B Ulrich; Arve Ulvik; Per-Magne Ueland; Matty P Weijenberg; Nina Habermann; Pekka Keski-Rahkonen; Andrea Gsur; Dieuwertje E Kok; Cornelia M Ulrich","Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.; Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University of Heidelberg, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.; Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 23, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.; Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.; Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.; School of Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilians University, 80539 Munich, Germany.; School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, 80333 Munich, Germany.; Department of Statistics and Operations Research, University of Vienna, 1, 1010 Wien, Austria.; Department of Epidemiology, GROW-School of Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University, 30, 6229 Maastricht, The Netherlands.; Nutrition and Metabolism Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer, WHO, 69366 Lyon, France.; Nutrition and Metabolism Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer, WHO, 69366 Lyon, France.; Nutrition and Metabolism Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer, WHO, 69366 Lyon, France.; Nutrition and Metabolism Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer, WHO, 69366 Lyon, France.; Division of Human Nutrition and Health, Wageningen University & Research, 6708 Wageningen, The Netherlands.; Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.; Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.; Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 23, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Division of Preventive Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University of Heidelberg, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.; Klinik für Allgemein-, Viszeral-, Thorax- und Gefäßchirurgie, Städtische Kliniken Neuss, 84, 41464 Neuss, Germany.; BEVITAL, 87, 5021 Bergen, Norway.; BEVITAL, 87, 5021 Bergen, Norway.; Department of Epidemiology, GROW-School of Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University, 30, 6229 Maastricht, The Netherlands.; Genome Biology, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.; Nutrition and Metabolism Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer, WHO, 69366 Lyon, France.; Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 23, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Division of Human Nutrition and Health, Wageningen University & Research, 6708 Wageningen, The Netherlands.; Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA."

Metabolomics, i.e., the analysis of metabolites in biological samples may offer a diet-responsive fingerprint for IBS. Our aim was to explore alterations in the plasma metabolome after interventions with fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) or gluten versus control in IBS, and to relate such alterations to symptoms. People with IBS (n = 110) were included in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study with 1-wk provocations of FODMAPs, gluten, or placebo. Symptoms were evaluated with the IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS). Untargeted metabolomics was performed on plasma samples using LC-qTOF-MS. Discovery of metabolite alterations by treatment was performed using random forest followed by linear mixed modeling. Associations were studied using Spearman correlation. The metabolome was affected by FODMAP [classification rate (CR) 0.88, P < 0.0001], but less by gluten intake CR 0.72, P = 0.01). FODMAP lowered bile acids, whereas phenolic-derived metabolites and 3-indolepropionic acid (IPA) were higher compared with placebo. IPA and some unidentified metabolites correlated weakly to abdominal pain and quality of life. Gluten affected lipid metabolism weakly, but with no interpretable relationship to IBS. FODMAP affected gut microbial-derived metabolites relating to positive health outcomes. IPA and unknown metabolites correlated weakly to IBS severity.

We found that TCC exposure at different doses significantly aggravated colitis phenotypes including shortened colon length and altered colonic histopathology. Mechanically, TCC exposure further disrupted intestinal barrier function, manifested by significant downregulation of the number of goblet cells, mucus layer thickness and expression of junction proteins (MUC-2, ZO-1, E-cadherin and Occludin). The gut microbiota composition and its metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and tryptophan metabolites were also markedly altered in DSS-induced colitis mice. Consequently, TCC exposure markedly exacerbated colonic inflammatory status of DSS-treated mice by activating NF-κB pathway. These findings provided new evidence that TCC could be an environmental hazards for development of IBD or even colon cancer.","2023","2023 Aug","Mengyu Qin; Hehua Lei; Yuchen Song; Mengjing Wu; Chuan Chen; Zheng Cao; Cui Zhang; Ruichen Du; Ce Zhang; Xian Wang; Limin Zhang","College of Chemistry and Materials Science, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China; State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, National Centre for Magnetic Resonance in Wuhan, Innovation Academy of Precision Measurement Science and Technology, CAS, Wuhan 430071, China.; State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, National Centre for Magnetic Resonance in Wuhan, Innovation Academy of Precision Measurement Science and Technology, CAS, Wuhan 430071, China.; State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, National Centre for Magnetic Resonance in Wuhan, Innovation Academy of Precision Measurement Science and Technology, CAS, Wuhan 430071, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.; College of Chemistry and Materials Science, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China; State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, National Centre for Magnetic Resonance in Wuhan, Innovation Academy of Precision Measurement Science and Technology, CAS, Wuhan 430071, China.; State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, National Centre for Magnetic Resonance in Wuhan, Innovation Academy of Precision Measurement Science and Technology, CAS, Wuhan 430071, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.; State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, National Centre for Magnetic Resonance in Wuhan, Innovation Academy of Precision Measurement Science and Technology, CAS, Wuhan 430071, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.; State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, National Centre for Magnetic Resonance in Wuhan, Innovation Academy of Precision Measurement Science and Technology, CAS, Wuhan 430071, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.; State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, National Centre for Magnetic Resonance in Wuhan, Innovation Academy of Precision Measurement Science and Technology, CAS, Wuhan 430071, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.; State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, National Centre for Magnetic Resonance in Wuhan, Innovation Academy of Precision Measurement Science and Technology, CAS, Wuhan 430071, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.; College of Chemistry and Materials Science, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China.

NCX4040 is also cytotoxic to several human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we examined the ferroptosis-dependent mechanism(s) of cytotoxicity of NCX4040 in HT-29 and K-RAS mutant HCT 116 colon cell lines. Ferroptosis is characterized by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the cell, leading to an iron-dependent oxidative stress-mediated cell death. However, its relevance in the mechanism of NCX4040 cytotoxicity in CRCs is not known. We found that NCX4040 generates ROS in CRC cells without any depletion of cellular GSH. Combinations of NCX4040 with erastin (ER) or RSL3 (RAS-selective lethal 3), known inducers of ferroptosis, enhanced CRC death. In contrast, ferrostatin-1, an inhibitor of ferroptosis, significantly inhibited NCX4040-induced cell death. Treatment of CRC cells with NCX4040 resulted in the induction of lipid peroxidation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. NCX4040 treatment induced several genes related to ferroptosis (e.g., CHAC1, GPX4 and NOX4) in both cell lines. Metabolomic studies also indicated significant increases in both lipid and energy metabolism following the drug treatment in HT-29 and HCT 116 cells. These observations strongly suggest that NCX4040 causes the ferroptosis-mediated cell death of CRC cells. Furthermore, combinations of NCX4040 and ER or RSL3 may contribute significantly to the treatment of CRC, including those that are difficult to treat due to the presence of Ras mutations in the clinic. NCX4040-induced ferroptosis may also be a dynamic form of cell death for the treatment of other cancers.","2023","2023 Jun 14","Birandra K Sinha; Carl D Bortner; Alan K Jarmusch; Erik J Tokar; Carri Murphy; Xian Wu; Heather Winter; Ronald E Cannon","Mechanistic Toxicology Branch, Division of Translational Toxicology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, Durham, NC 27709, USA.; Laboratory of Signal Transduction, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, Durham, NC 27709, USA.; Immunity, Inflammation, and Disease Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, Durham, NC 27709, USA.; Mechanistic Toxicology Branch, Division of Translational Toxicology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, Durham, NC 27709, USA.; Mechanistic Toxicology Branch, Division of Translational Toxicology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, Durham, NC 27709, USA.; Mechanistic Toxicology Branch, Division of Translational Toxicology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, Durham, NC 27709, USA.; Immunity, Inflammation, and Disease Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, Durham, NC 27709, USA.; Mechanistic Toxicology Branch, Division of Translational Toxicology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, Durham, NC 27709, USA."

We conducted a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis and biological validation in clinical samples and animal tumor xenografts to understand its prognostic value and association with immune characteristics in various cancers. We used the Cancer Genome Atlas gene expression data involving 5769 patients and 20 cancer types. Vitamin C index (VCI) was calculated using the expression of 11 genes known to genetically predict vitamin C levels, which were classified into high and low subgroups. The correlation between VCI and patient overall survival (OS), tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and immune microenvironment was evaluated, using Kaplan-Meier analysis method and ESTIMATE (https://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/estimate/). Clinical samples of breast cancer and normal tissues were used to validate the expression of VCI-related genes, and animal experiments were conducted to test the impact of vitamin C on colon cancer growth and immune cell infiltration. Significant changes in expression of VCI-predicted genes were observed in multiple cancer types, especially in breast cancer. There was a correlation of VCI with prognosis in all samples (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.78-0.98; P = 0.02). The specific cancer types that exhibited significant correlation between VCI and OS included breast cancer (AHR = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.05-0.40; P < 0.01), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (AHR = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.07-0.59; P < 0.01), kidney clear cell carcinoma (AHR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.48-0.92; P = 0.01), and rectum adenocarcinoma (AHR = 0.01; 95% CI = 0.001-0.38; P = 0.02).

Here, we developed a targeted odd-chain fatty acyl-containing lipidomics method based on equivalent carbon number and retention time prediction. The method displayed good reproducibility and robustness as shown by peak width at half height within 0.7 min and coefficient of variation under 20%.

Using this method, we quantified odd-chain fatty acyl-containing lipidome in tissues from 12 colon cancer patients, revealing the remodeling of triacylglycerol. The dynamics of odd-chain fatty acyl lipids were further consolidated by the association with genomic and proteomic features of altered catabolism of branched-chain amino acids and triacylglycerol endogenous synthesis in colon cancer.

The results showed that ME had superior advantages in ameliorating disease activity index score and inflammatory phenotype, in comparison with the AOM/DSS group. The number and size of polypoid colonic tumors were decreased after pre-administration of ME. In addition, ME was found to reverse the downregulation of tight junction proteins (zonula occluden-1 and occluding) while suppressing the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1β and IL-6) in models. Moreover, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediated intracellular nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-containing signaling cascades, including inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, and exhibited decreasing expression in the mice model after ME pre-administration. 16s rRNA analysis and untargeted-metabolomics profiling of fecal samples inferred that ME revealed ideal prevention of intestinal dysbiosis in CAC mice, accompanied by and correlated with alterations in the composition of metabolites.

This study investigated the role of dietary rice bran-mediated changes to fecal microbiota and metabolites over the time course of colon carcinogenesis and compared murine fecal metabolites to human stool metabolic profiles following rice bran consumption by colorectal cancer survivors (NCT01929122). Forty adult male BALB/c mice were subjected to azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis and randomized to control AIN93M (n = 20) or diets containing 10% w/w heat-stabilized rice bran (n = 20). Feces were serially collected for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics. Fecal microbiota richness and diversity was increased in mice and humans with dietary rice bran treatment. Key drivers of differential bacterial abundances from rice bran intake in mice included Akkermansia, Lactococcus, Lachnospiraceae, and Eubacterium xylanophilum. Murine fecal metabolomics revealed 592 biochemical identities with notable changes to fatty acids, phenolics, and vitamins.

The kinetics of murine metabolic changes by the host and gut microbiome following rice bran consumption complemented changes observed in humans for apigenin, N-acetylhistamine, and ethylmalonate in feces. Increased enterolactone abundance is a novel diet-driven microbial metabolite fecal biomarker following rice bran consumption in mice and humans from this study. Dietary rice bran bioactivity via gut microbiome metabolism in mice and humans contributes to protection against colorectal cancer. The findings from this study provide compelling support for rice bran in clinical and public health guidelines for colorectal cancer prevention and control.","2023","2023 Apr 10","Annika M Weber; Hend Ibrahim; Bridget A Baxter; Robin Kumar; Akhilendra K Maurya; Dileep Kumar; Rajesh Agarwal; Komal Raina; Elizabeth P Ryan","Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.; Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig 44519, Egypt.; Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.; Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD 57007, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD 57007, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA."

We aimed to explore the changes in fecal metabolism after CT-guided RFA in CC mice. The orthotopic CC mice received CT-guided RFA upon modeling. Subsequently, we quantified tumor volumes and weights to assess treatment efficacy. Next, because metabolomics is useful for evaluating therapeutic validity, feces were collected for metabolomics analysis. CT-guided RFA inhibited tumor growth effectively. Additionally, metabolomics results showed that the contents of bile acids and fatty acids were downregulated in CC mouse feces. Moreover, the levels of amino acids and carbohydrates were decreased while the levels of fatty acids, organic acids, phenols, pyridines and short-chain fatty acids were elevated in feces after CC mice received CT-guided RFA. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that those differential metabolites were closely related to fatty acids degradation and synthesis. CT-guided RFA possesses a strong ability to suppress CC development in mice, accompanied by a significant increase of fatty acid content in feces. This study proposes a novel approach and target for CC treatment, which provides hope for CC patients and establishes a solid basis for future in-depth studies.","2023","2023 Aug","Jin Cai; Linfang Zhao; Lingdi Li; Jun Lou; Rongjun Tang; Ke Zhang; Qingqing Yu; Weixing Mo","Department of Special Inspection, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Ultrasound, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Medical Oncology, Affiliated Hangzhou Cancer Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Ultrasound, Affiliated Hangzhou Cancer Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Thermotherapy Center, Affiliated Hangzhou Cancer Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Thermotherapy Center, Affiliated Hangzhou Cancer Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Radiotherapy, Affiliated Hangzhou Cancer Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Radiology, Affiliated Hangzhou Cancer Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."

Most GI cancer deaths can be reduced by earlier detection and more appropriate medical treatment. Unlike the current ""gold standard"" techniques, non-invasive and highly sensitive screening tests are required for GI cancer diagnosis. Here, we explored the potential of metabolomics for GI cancer detection and the classification of tissue-of-origin, and even the prognosis management. Plasma samples from 37 gastric cancer (GC), 17 colon cancer (CC), and 27 non-cancer (NC) patients were prepared for metabolomics and lipidomics analysis by three MS-based platforms. Univariate, multivariate, and clustering analyses were used for selecting significant metabolic features. ROC curve analysis was based on a series of different binary classifications as well as the true-positive rate (sensitivity) and the false-positive rate (1-specificity). GI cancers exhibited obvious metabolic perturbation compared with benign diseases. The differentiated metabolites of gastric cancer (GC) and colon cancer (CC) were targeted to same pathways but with different degrees of cellular metabolism reprogramming. The cancer-specific metabolites distinguished the malignant and benign, and classified the cancer types. We also applied this test to before- and after-surgery samples, wherein surgical resection significantly altered the blood-metabolic patterns. There were 15 metabolites significantly altered in GC and CC patients who underwent surgical treatment, and partly returned to normal conditions. Blood-based metabolomics analysis is an efficient strategy for GI cancer screening, especially for malignant and benign diagnoses. The cancer-specific metabolic patterns process the potential for classifying tissue-of-origin in multi-cancer screening. Besides, the circulating metabolites for prognosis management of GI cancer is a promising area of research.","2023","2023 Apr 04","Guodong Song; Li Wang; Junlong Tang; Haohui Li; Shuyu Pang; Yan Li; Li Liu; Junyuan Hu","The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, No 23.

Summary-level data for gut microbiota and metabolites were obtained from MiBioGen, FINRISK and human metabolome consortia. Summary-level data for colorectal cancer were derived from a genome-wide association study meta-analysis. In forward Mendelian randomization (MR), we employed genetic instrumental variables (IV) for 24 gut microbiota taxa and six bacterial metabolites to examine their causal relationship with colorectal cancer. We also used a lenient threshold for nine apriori gut microbiota taxa as secondary analyses. In reverse MR, we explored association between genetic liability to colorectal neoplasia and abundance of microbiota studied above using 95, 19, and 7 IVs for colorectal cancer, adenoma, and polyps, respectively. Forward MR did not find evidence indicating causal relationship between any of the gut microbiota taxa or six bacterial metabolites tested and colorectal cancer risk. However, reverse MR supported genetic liability to colorectal adenomas was causally related with increased abundance of two taxa: Gammaproteobacteria (β = 0.027, which represents a 0.027 increase in log-transformed relative abundance values of Gammaproteobacteria for per one-unit increase in log OR of adenoma risk; P = 7.06×10-8), Enterobacteriaceae (β = 0.023, P = 1.29×10-5). We find genetic liability to colorectal neoplasia may be associated with abundance of certain microbiota taxa. It is more likely that subset of colorectal cancer genetic liability variants changes gut biology by influencing both gut microbiota and colorectal cancer risk.

The growth and proliferation rate, colony-forming capacity, apoptosis, cell cycle, redox homeostasis and metabolomic analysis were evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test (MTT), flow cytometry, high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques. The results show that glutamine represents an important metabolite for cell growth and that its deprivation reduces the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. Glutamine depletion induces cell death and cell cycle arrest in the GO/G1 phase by modulating energy metabolism, the amino acid content and antioxidant defenses. Moreover, the combined glutamine starvation with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose exerted a stronger cytotoxic effect.

However, the lack of animal studies hinders a deeper mechanistic understanding of the cancer-promoting effects of ZEA. This study aimed to determine the effect of ZEA on colon cancer progression and its underlying mechanisms. Through integrative analyses of transcriptomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, and host phenotypes, we investigated the impact of a 4-week ZEA intervention on colorectal cancer in xenograft mice. Our results showed a twofold increase in tumor weight with the 4-week ZEA intervention. ZEA exposure significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of BEST4, DGKB, and Ki67 and the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and AKT. Serum metabolomic analysis revealed that the levels of amino acids, including histidine, arginine, citrulline, and glycine, decreased significantly in the ZEA group. Furthermore, ZEA lowered the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota and reduced the abundance of nine genera, including Tuzzerella and Rikenella. Further association analysis indicated that Tuzzerella was negatively associated with the expression of BEST4 and DGKB genes, serum uric acid levels, and tumor weight. Additionally, circulatory hippuric acid levels positively correlated with tumor weight and the expression of oncogenic genes, including ROBO3, JAK3, and BEST4. Altogether, our results indicated that ZEA promotes colon cancer progression by enhancing the BEST4/AKT/ERK1/2 pathway, lowering circulatory amino acid concentrations, altering gut microbiota composition, and suppressing short chain fatty acids production.","2023","2023","Emily Kwun Kwan Lo; Xiuwan Wang; Pui-Kei Lee; Ho-Ching Wong; Jetty Chung-Yung Lee; Carlos Gómez-Gallego; Danyue Zhao; Hani El-Nezami; Jun Li","School of Biological Sciences, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam 999077, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Infectious Diseases and Public Health, Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.; School of Biological Sciences, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam 999077, Hong Kong, China.; Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland.; Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.; Research Institute for Future Food, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Food Science and Nutrition, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.; School of Biological Sciences, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam 999077, Hong Kong, China.; Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland.; Department of Infectious Diseases and Public Health, Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China."

Here, Lactobacillus plantarum was treated with curcumin (the major compound of turmeric), and its resistance to the curcumin was determined. After then the cell-free supernatants of untreated bacteria (CFS) and bacteria treated with curcumin (cur-CFS) were isolated and their anti-proliferative properties against HT-29 colon cancer cells were compared. The ability of L. plantarum treated with curcumin to combat a variety of pathogenic bacterial species and its ability to survive in acidic conditions were evidence that the probiotic properties of the bacterium were unaffected by the curcumin treatment. L. plantarum treated with curcumin and intact L. plantarum were both able to live in acidic conditions, according to the results of the resistance to low pH test. The MTT result showed that CFS and cur-CFS dose-dependently decreased the growth of HT29 cells with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 181.7 and 116.3 µL/mL at 48 h, respectively. Morphological alteration of DAPI-stained cells also exhibited significant fragmentation in the chromatin within the nucleus of cur-CFS-treated cells compared to CFS-treated HT29 cells. Moreover, flow cytometry analyses of apoptosis and cell cycle confirmed DAPI staining and MTT assay results and stipulated the increased occurrence of programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cur-CFS-treated cells (~ 57.65%) compared to CFS-treated cells (~ 47%). These results were more confirmed with qPCR and exhibited the upregulation of Caspase 9-3 and BAX genes, and downregulation of the BCL-2 gene in cur-CFS- and CFS-treated cells. In conclusion, turmeric spice and curcumin may affect the metabolomics of probiotics in intestinal flora which could subsequently influence their anticancer properties.","2023","2023 Feb 17","Faranak Gholipour; Mohammad Amini; Behzad Baradaran; Ahad Mokhtarzadeh; Morteza Eskandani","Department of Biological Science, Faculty of Basic Science, Higher Education Institute of Rab-Rashid, Tabriz, Iran.; Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. mokhtarzadehah@tbzmed.ac.ir.; Research Center for Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology (RCPN), Biomedicine Institute, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. eskandanim@tbzmed.ac.ir."

CF patients have reductions in intestinal bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), although it is unclear whether this corresponds with intestinal SCFA levels and the presence of colonic neoplasia. The aim of this study was to compare gut microbiome and SCFA composition in patients with and without CF, and to assess associations with colonic adenomas. Colonic aspirates were obtained from adults with and without CF undergoing colon cancer screening or surveillance colonoscopy. Microbiome characterization was performed by 16S rRNA V3-V4 sequencing. Targeted profiling of SCFAs and related metabolites was performed by LC-MS. 42 patients (21 CF, 21 control) were enrolled. CF patients had significantly reduced alpha diversity and decreased relative abundance of many SCFA-producing taxa. There were no significant differences in SCFA levels in CF patients, although there were reduced levels of branched chain fatty acids (BCFAs) and related metabolites. CF patients with adenomas, but not controls with adenomas, had significantly increased relative abundance of Bacteroides fragilis. CF microbiome composition was significantly associated with isovalerate concentration and the presence of adenomas. CF patients have marked disturbances in the gut microbiome, and CF patients with adenomas had notably increased relative abundance of B. fragilis, a pathogen known to promote colon cancer. Reductions in BCFAs but not SCFAs were found in CF. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the role of B. fragilis as well the biological significance of reductions in BCFAs in CF.","2023","2023 Jul","Brittany L Baldwin-Hunter; Felix D Rozenberg; Medini K Annavajhala; Heekuk Park; Emily A DiMango; Claire L Keating; Anne-Catrin Uhlemann; Julian A Abrams","Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.; Microbiome and Pathogen Genomics Collaborative Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.; Microbiome and Pathogen Genomics Collaborative Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.; Microbiome and Pathogen Genomics Collaborative Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Gunnar Esiason Adult Cystic Fibrosis and Lung Disease Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Gunnar Esiason Adult Cystic Fibrosis and Lung Disease Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Microbiome and Pathogen Genomics Collaborative Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Digestive and Liver Disease Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

In this study, we constructed a mouse model of inflammation-induced colorectal tumors, with fixed doses of azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS). We found that colorectal tumors only formed in some mice treated with certain concentrations of AOM/DSS (tumor group), whereas other mice did not develop tumors (non-tumor group). 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS analyses were performed to investigate the microbes and metabolites in the fecal samples. As a result, 1189 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained from the fecal samples, and the non-tumor group had a relatively higher OTU richness and diversity. Moreover, 53 different microbes were identified at the phylum and genus levels, including Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Prevotella. Furthermore, four bacterial taxa were obviously enriched in the non-tumor group, according to linear discriminant analysis scores (log10) > 4. The untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed significant differences between the fecal samples and metabolic phenotypes. Further, the heatmaps and volcano plots revealed 53 and 19 dysregulated metabolites between the groups, in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Styrene degradation and amino sugar-nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways were significantly different in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Moreover, a correlation analysis between the metabolome and microbiome was further conducted, which revealed the key microbiota and metabolites. In conclusion, we successfully established a tumor model using a certain dose of AOM/DSS and identified the differential intestinal microbiota and characteristic metabolites that might modulate tumorigenesis, thereby providing new concepts for the prevention and treatment of CRC.","2022","2022","Yuntian Hong; Baoxiang Chen; Xiang Zhai; Qun Qian; Rui Gui; Congqing Jiang","Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.; Clinical Center of Intestinal and Colorectal Diseases of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China.; Key Laboratory of Intestinal and Colorectal Diseases of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China.; Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.; Clinical Center of Intestinal and Colorectal Diseases of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China.; Key Laboratory of Intestinal and Colorectal Diseases of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China.; Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.; Clinical Center of Intestinal and Colorectal Diseases of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China.; Key Laboratory of Intestinal and Colorectal Diseases of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China.; Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.; Clinical Center of Intestinal and Colorectal Diseases of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China.; Key Laboratory of Intestinal and Colorectal Diseases of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.; Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.; Clinical Center of Intestinal and Colorectal Diseases of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China.; Key Laboratory of Intestinal and Colorectal Diseases of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China."

Endogenous serine arises from de novo synthesis pathways. As the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway, PHGDH is highly expressed in a variety of tumors including colon cancer. Therefore, targeted inhibition of PHGDH is an important strategy for anti-tumor therapy research. However, the specific gene expression and metabolic pathways regulated by PHGDH in colon cancer are still unclear. Our study was aimed to clarified the role of PHGDH in serine metabolism in colon cancer to provide new knowledge for in-depth understanding of serine metabolism and PHGDH function in colon cancer. Methods: In this study, we analyzed the gene expression and metabolic remodeling process of colon cancer cells (SW620) after targeted inhibition of PHGDH by gene transcriptomics and metabolomics. LC-MS analysis was performed in 293T cells to PHGDH gene transcription and protein post-translational modification under depriving exogenous serine. Results: We found that amino acid transporters, amino acid metabolism, lipid synthesis related pathways compensation and other processes are involved in the response process after PHGDH inhibition. And ATF4 mediated the transcriptional expression of PHGDH under exogenous serine deficiency conditions. While LC-MS analysis of post-translational modification revealed that PHGDH produced changes in acetylation sites after serine deprivation that the K289 site was lost, and a new acetylation site K21was produced. Conclusion: Our study performed transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis by inhibiting PHGDH, thus clarifying the role of PHGDH in gene transcription and metabolism in colon cancer cells. The mechanism of high PHGDH expression in colon cancer cells and the acetylation modification that occurs in PHGDH protein were also clarified by serine deprivation.

This chapter will describe two different experimental approaches for the evaluation of NK-tumor cell interactions. First, a detailed protocol for the setting up of NK-tumor cell co-cultures will be illustrated, followed by information on cell imaging techniques, useful for assessing cell morphology and cytoskeletal changes. The second part will be focused on the description of a proteomic approach aimed at investigating the effect of this crosstalk from another point of view, i.e., characterizing the cellular and molecular pathways modulated in tumor cells following interaction with NK cells. The chapter centers on the interaction between NK and melanoma cells and refers to experimental approaches we set up to study the effects of this cross-talk on the process of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Nevertheless, the described protocols can be quite easily adapted to study the interaction of NK cells with adherent tumor cell lines of different origin and histotype, as in our original study, we also analyzed possible NK-induced morphologic changes in the cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cells and the colon cancer HT29 cells.","2023","2023","Chiara Lavarello; Paola Orecchia; Andrea Petretto; Massimo Vitale; Claudia Cantoni; Monica Parodi","Core Facilities-Clinical Proteomics and Metabolomics, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy.; IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino Genova, Genoa, Italy.; Core Facilities-Clinical Proteomics and Metabolomics, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy.; IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino Genova, Genoa, Italy.

However, the efficacy of C3DM on glioma has not been proved yet. In this study, the antitumor activities and underlying mechanisms of C3DM on glioma were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Cell viability, apoptosis, migration, FCM, IHC, RT-qPCR, quantitative proteomics, and western blotting were conducted to evaluate the effect of C3DM on glioma cells. ADP-Glo™ kinase assay was used to validate the interaction between C3DM and EGFR. Co-cultured assays, lactic acid kit, and spatially resolved metabolomics were performed to study the function of C3DM in regulating glioma microenvironment. Both subcutaneously transplanted syngeneic models and orthotopic models of glioma were used to determine the effect of C3DM on tumor growth in vivo. We found that C3DM dose-dependently induced apoptosis, and inhibited the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of glioma cells. C3DM significantly inhibited tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse glioma models. Moreover, C3DM attenuated the acidified glioma microenvironment and enhanced T-cell function. Additionally, C3DM inhibited the kinase activity of EGFR and influenced the EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in glioma.

More recently, the introduction of organoids has provided the research community with a more versatile model system. Physiological structure and organization of the cell source tissue are maintained in organoids, representing a closer link to in vivo tumor models. High-resolution magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HR MAS MRS) is a commonly applied analytical approach for metabolic profiling of intact tissue, but its use has not been reported for organoids. The aim of the current work was to compare the performance of HR MAS MRS and extraction-based nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in metabolic profiling of wild-type and tumor progression organoids (TPOs) from human colon cancer, and further to investigate how the sequentially increased genetic alterations of the TPOs affect the metabolic profile. Sixteen metabolites were reliably identified and quantified both in spectra based on NMR of extracts and HR MAS MRS of intact organoids. The metabolite concentrations from the two approaches were highly correlated (r = 0.94), and both approaches were able to capture the systematic changes in metabolic features introduced by the genetic alterations characteristic of colorectal cancer progression (e.g., increased levels of lactate and decreased levels of myo-inositol and phosphocholine with an increasing number of mutations). The current work highlights that HR MAS MRS is a well-suited method for metabolic profiling of intact organoids, with the additional benefit that the nondestructive nature of HR MAS enables subsequent recovery of the organoids for further analyses based on nucleic acids or proteins.","2023","2023 Apr","Wybe J M van der Kemp; Maria T Grinde; Jon O Malvik; Hanneke W M van Laarhoven; Jeanine J Prompers; Dennis W J Klomp; Boudewijn Burgering; Tone Frost Bathen; Siver Andreas Moestue","Division of Imaging and Oncology, University Medical Centre (UMC) Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging, NTNU - Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.; Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.; Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging, NTNU - Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.; Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Division of Imaging and Oncology, University Medical Centre (UMC) Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Division of Imaging and Oncology, University Medical Centre (UMC) Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Center for Molecular Medicine, Molecular Cancer Research, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging, NTNU - Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.; Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, NTNU - Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.; Department of Pharmacy, Nord University, Bodø, Norway."

Our previous data show that compared to an AIN-93 diet (AIN), a HFD promotes azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation and microbial dysbiosis in C57BL/6 mice. To explore the underlying metabolic basis, we hypothesize that AOM treatment triggers a different fecal metabolomic profile in C57BL/6 mice fed the HFD or the AIN. We found that 65 of 196 identified metabolites were significantly different among the four groups of mice (AIN, AIN + AOM, HFD, and HFD + AOM). A sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLSDA) showed that concentrations of nine fecal lipid metabolites were increased in the HFD + AOM compared to the HFD, which played a key role in overall metabolome group separation. These nine fecal lipid metabolite concentrations were positively associated with the number of colonic ACF, the cell proliferation of Ki67 proteins, and the abundance of dysbiotic bacteria.

Chemical metabolomics has been involved in the new drug delivery systems. Metabolomics profiling of DOX-applied HCT116 colon cancer cellular metabolisms is rare. We used 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in this study to clarify how DOX exposure affected HCT116 colon cancer cells. Metabolomics profiling in HCT116 cells detects 50 metabolites. Tracking metabolites can reveal pathway activities. HCT116 colon cancer cells were evenly treated with different concentrations of DOX for 24 h. The endogenous metabolites were identified by comparison with healthy cells. We found that acetate, glucose, glutamate, glutamine, sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, valine, methionine, and isoleucine were increased. Metabolic expression of alanine, choline, fumarate, taurine, o-phosphocholine, inosine, lysine, and phenylalanine was decreased in HCT116 cancer cells. The metabolic phenotypic expression is markedly altered during a high dose of DOX. It is the first time that there is a metabolite pool and phenotypic expression in colon cancer cells.

However, systematically elucidating its mechanisms of action remains a great challenge to the field. In this study, taking advantage of the network pharmacology approach, we discovered a potential new use of HGWD for patients with colon cancer (CC). Our in vivo result showed that orally administered HGWD markedly inhibited the growth of CC xenografts in mice. The subsequent enrichment analyses for the core therapeutic targets revealed that HGWD could affect multiple biological processes involving CC growth, such as metabolic reprogramming, apoptosis and immune regulation, through inhibiting multiple cell survival-related signalings, including MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways. Notably, these in silico analysis results were most experimentally verified by a series of in vitro assays. Furthermore, our results based on serum metabolomics showed that the lipid metabolic pathways, including fatty acid biosynthesis and cholesterol metabolism, play key roles in delivery of the anti-CC effect of HGWD on tumor-bearing mice, and that cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member 1 (CYP2E1) is a potential therapeutic target. Together, our integrated approach reveals a therapeutic effect of HGWD on CC, providing a valuable insight into developing strategies to predict and interpret the mechanisms of action for Chinese herbal decoctions.","2022","2022","Boyu Pan; Yafei Xia; Senbiao Fang; Jun Ai; Kunpeng Wang; Jian Zhang; Chunshuang Du; Yuzhou Chen; Liren Liu; Shu Yan","Tianjin Key Laboratory of Acute Abdomen Disease Associated Organ Injury and ITCWM Repair, ITCWM Hospital, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.; Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China.; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Acute Abdomen Disease Associated Organ Injury and ITCWM Repair, ITCWM Hospital, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.; Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China.; Department of Laboratory Animal Science, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Stomatological Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.; Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China.; Department of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China.; Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.; Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China.; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Acute Abdomen Disease Associated Organ Injury and ITCWM Repair, ITCWM Hospital, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."

Establishing an effective treatment strategies of early colon cancer is of great significance for preventing its development and reducing mortality. The occurrence of colon cancer is closely related to changes in the intestinal flora structure. Therefore, remodelling the intestinal flora structure through prebiotics is a powerful approach for preventing and treating the occurrence and development of colon cancer. Isomaltooligosaccharides (IMOs) are often found in fermented foods and can directly reach the gut for use by microorganisms. In this study, a rat model of early colon cancer (DMH) was established by subcutaneous injection of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, and the model rats were fed IMOs as a dietary intervention (DI). The untargeted faecal metabolomics, gut metabolome and intestinal function of the model rats were investigated. The results showed that DMH, DI and IMOs alone (IMOs) groups exhibited gut microbial community changes. In the DI group, there was an increased abundance of probiotics (Lactobacillus) and decreased abundance of CC marker bacteria (Fusobacterium). The key variations in the faecal metabolites of the DI group included decreased levels of glucose, bile acids (including deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid) and amino acids (including L-glutamic acid and L-alanine). In addition, dietary intake of IMOs attenuated the intestinal inflammatory response, improved the intestinal microecological environment, and slowed the development of DMH-induced early CC in rats.

Veillonella parvula, an asaccharolytic, anaerobic, oral microbe that derives energy from organic acids, increases in abundance in the intestine of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Here we show that nitrate, a signature metabolite of inflammation, allows V. parvula to transition from fermentation to anaerobic respiration. Nitrate respiration, through the narGHJI operon, boosted Veillonella growth on organic acids and also modulated its metabolic repertoire, allowing it to use amino acids and peptides as carbon sources. This metabolic shift was accompanied by changes in carbon metabolism and ATP production pathways. Nitrate respiration was fundamental for ectopic colonization in a mouse model of colitis, because a V. parvula narG deletion mutant colonized significantly less than a wild-type strain during inflammation. These results suggest that V. parvula harness conditions present during inflammation to colonize in the intestine.","2022","2022 Oct","Daniel F Rojas-Tapias; Eric M Brown; Emily R Temple; Michelle A Onyekaba; Ahmed M T Mohamed; Kellyanne Duncan; Melanie Schirmer; Rebecca L Walker; Toufic Mayassi; Kerry A Pierce; Julián Ávila-Pacheco; Clary B Clish; Hera Vlamakis; Ramnik J Xavier","Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Center for Computational and Integrative Biology and Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Agricultural Microbiology, Colombian Corporation for Agricultural Research-Agrosavia, Bogotá, Colombia.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Center for Computational and Integrative Biology and Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Center for Computational and Integrative Biology and Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Center for Computational and Integrative Biology and Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Emmy Noether Group, ZIEL-Institute for Food and Health, Technical University of Munich, Freising, Germany.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Center for Computational and Integrative Biology and Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Metabolomics Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Metabolomics Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Metabolomics Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA. xavier@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu.; Center for Computational and Integrative Biology and Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. xavier@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu.; Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA. xavier@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu."

This study was initiated to elucidate the role of the BolA in the virulence of K. pneumoniae. Using a mouse infection model, we revealed bolA mutant strain yielded significantly decreased bacterial loads in the liver, spleen, lung, and kidney, and failed to form liver abscesses. Gene deletion demonstrated that the bolA was required for siderophore production, biofilm formation, and adhesion to human colon cancer epithelial cells HCT116. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) indicated that BolA could impact the expression of pulK, pulF, pulE, clpV, vgrG, entE, relA, and spoT genes on a genome-wide scale, which are related to type II secretion system (T2SS), type VI secretion system (T6SS), guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), and siderophore synthesis and contribute to fitness in the host. Furthermore, the metabolome analysis showed that the deletion of the bolA gene led to decreased pools of five metabolites: biotin, spermine, cadaverine, guanosine, and flavin adenine dinucleotide, all of which are involved in pathways related to virulence and stress resistance. Taken together, we provided evidence that BolA was a significant virulence factor in the ability of K. pneumoniae to survive, and this was an important step in progress to an understanding of the pathways underlying bacterial virulence. IMPORTANCE BolA has been characterized as an important transcriptional regulator, which is induced in the stationary phase of growth and affects different pathways directly associated with bacterial virulence. Here, we unraveled the role of BolA in several phenotypes associated with the process of cell morphology, siderophore production, biofilm formation, cell adhesion, tissue colonization, and liver abscess. We also uncovered the importance of BolA for the success of K. pneumoniae infection and provided new clues to the pathogenesis strategies of this organism. This work constitutes a relevant step toward an understanding of the role of BolA protein as a master regulator and virulence factor.

Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, alters gut bacteria and metabolites in association with suppressing the development of intestinal polyps in mice. The current study sought to evaluate whether celecoxib exerts its chemopreventive effects, in part, through intestinal bacteria and metabolomic alterations. Using ApcMin/+ mice, we demonstrated that treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABx) reduced abundance of gut bacteria and attenuated the ability of celecoxib to suppress intestinal tumorigenesis. Use of ABx also impaired celecoxib's ability to shift microbial populations and gut luminal and circulating metabolites. Treatment with ABx alone markedly reduced tumor number and size in ApcMin/+ mice, in conjunction with profoundly altering the metabolite profiles of the intestinal lumen and blood. Many of the metabolite changes in the gut and circulation overlapped and included shifts in microbially derived metabolites. To complement these findings in mice, we evaluated the effects of ABx on circulating metabolites in patients with colon cancer. This showed that ABx treatment led to a shift in blood metabolites, including several that were of bacterial origin. Importantly, changes in metabolites in patients given ABx overlapped with alterations found in mice that also received ABx. Taken together, these findings suggest a potential role for bacterial metabolites in mediating both the chemopreventive effects of celecoxib and intestinal tumor growth. This study demonstrates novel mechanisms by which chemopreventive agents exert their effects and gut microbiota impact intestinal tumor development. These findings have the potential to lead to improved cancer prevention strategies by modulating microbes and their metabolites.","2022","2022 Dec 01","Carmen R Ferrara; Ji Dong K Bai; Erin M McNally; Gregory G Putzel; Xi Kathy Zhou; Hanhan Wang; Alan Lang; Deborah Nagle; Paula Denoya; Jan Krumsiek; Andrew J Dannenberg; David C Montrose","Department of Pathology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York.; Department of Pathology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York.; Departments of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.; Departments of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.; Healthcare Policy and Research, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.; Healthcare Policy and Research, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.; Department of Pathology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York.; Department of Surgery, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York.; Department of Surgery, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York.; Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.; Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, New York, New York.; Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, New York, New York.; Department of Medicine (retired), Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.; Department of Pathology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York.; Stony Brook Cancer Center, Stony Brook, New York."

Cellular proliferation and de novo synthesis of lipids are related to cancer progression. In this study, we evaluated the lipidomic profile of two-dimensional (2D) monolayer and multicellular tumor spheroids from the HCT 116 colon carcinoma cell line. We utilized serial trypsinization on the spheroid samples to generate three cellular populations representing the proliferative, quiescent, and necrotic regions of the spheroid. This analysis enabled a comprehensive identification and quantification of lipids produced in each of the spheroid layer and 2D cultures. We show that lipid subclasses associated with lipid droplets form in oxygen-restricted and acidic regions of spheroids and are produced at higher levels than in 2D cultures. Additionally, sphingolipid production, which is implicated in cell death and survival pathways, is higher in spheroids relative to 2D cells. Finally, we show that increased numbers of lipids composed of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are produced in the quiescent and necrotic regions of the spheroid. The lipidomic signature for each region and cell culture type highlights the importance of understanding the spatial aspects of cancer biology. These results provide additional lipid biomarkers in colon cancer cells that can be further studied to target pivotal lipid production pathways.","2022","2022 Aug","Fernando Tobias; Amanda B Hummon","Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA."

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a potential approach to improving the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, whereas the detailed mechanisms and the applicability of this combination therapy remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the synergistic effect of FMT with anti-PD-1 in curing colorectal tumor-bearing mice using a multi-omics approach. Mice treated with the combination therapy showed superior survival rate and tumor control, compared to the mice received anti-PD-1 therapy or FMT alone. Metagenomic analysis showed that composition of gut microbiota in tumor-bearing mice treated with anti-PD-1 therapy was remarkably altered through receiving FMT. Particularly, Bacteroides genus, including FMT-increased B. thetaiotaomicron, B. fragilis, and FMT-decreased B. ovatus might contribute to the enhanced efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis upon mouse plasma revealed several potential metabolites that upregulated after FMT, including punicic acid and aspirin, might promote the response to anti-PD-1 therapy via their immunomodulatory functions. This work broadens our understanding of the mechanism by which FMT improves the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, which may contribute to the development of novel microbiota-based anti-cancer therapies.","2022","2022","Jiayuan Huang; Xing Zheng; Wanying Kang; Huaijie Hao; Yudan Mao; Hua Zhang; Yuan Chen; Yan Tan; Yulong He; Wenjing Zhao; Yiming Yin","School of Medicine, Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen, China.; Department of Research and Development, Shenzhen Xbiome Biotech Co.

Here, using an animal model of colitis to colon-cancerous transformation, we demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress couples with metabolic reprogramming to promote a malignant transformation of chronic inflammation. The animal model for chronic colitis to colon-cancerous transformation was established in C57BL/6N mice by azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatments. The differential proteins in control and AOM/DSS-treated colon mucosa were determined using proteomic analysis; the kinetics of metabolic modifications were monitored by mitochondrial oxygen flux, extracellular acidification, and targeted metabolomics; the molecule linker between ER stress and metabolic modifications were identified by coimmunoprecipitation, KEGG pathway analysis, and the subcutaneous tumor model using gene-specific knockdown colon cancer cells. Tissue array analysis were used to evaluate the differential protein in cancer and cancer-adjacent tissues. AOM/DSS treatment induced 38 tumors in 10 mice at the 14th week with the mean tumor size 9.35 ± 3.87 mm2, which was significantly decreased to 5.85 ± 0.95 mm2 by the ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (4PBA). Seven differential proteins were determined from control (1,067 ± 48) and AOM/DSS-treated mucosa (1,077 ± 59); the level of ER protein PDIA2 (protein disulfide isomerase-associated 2) was increased over 7-fold in response to AOM/DSS treatment. PDIA2 interacted with 420 proteins that were involved in 8 signaling pathways, in particular with 53 proteins in metabolic pathways. PDIA2 translocated from ER to mitochondria and interacted with the components of complexes I and II to inhibit oxophosphorylation but increase glycolysis. Knockdown PDIA2 in colon cancer cells restored the metabolic imbalance and significantly repressed tumor growth in the xenograft animal model. 4PBA therapy inhibited the AOM/DSS-mediated overexpression of PDIA2 and metabolic modifications and suppressed colon cancer growth. In clinic, PDIA2 was overexpressed in colon cancer tissues rather than cancer-adjacent tissues and was related with the late stages and lymph node metastasis of colon cancer. Persistent ER stress reprograms the metabolism to promote the malignant transformation of chronic colitis; PDIA2 serves as a molecule linker between ER stress and metabolic reprogramming. The inhibition of ER stress restores metabolic homeostasis and attenuates the cancerous transformation of chronic inflammation.","2022","2022","Jie Tao; Lin Yin; Ao Wu; Jiaoli Zhang; Jingpu Zhang; Huichun Shi; Siyuan Liu; Liangfei Niu; Li Xu; Yanling Feng; Shixian Lian; Lei Li; Liyan Zeng; Xianmin Meng; Xiaohui Zhou; Tiefu Liu; Lijun Zhang","Scientific Research Institute, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Scientific Research Institute, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Scientific Research Institute, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Scientific Research Institute, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Scientific Research Institute, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Scientific Research Institute, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; The College of Information, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China.; Scientific Research Institute, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Scientific Research Institute, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Clinical Pathology Laboratory, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Surgery, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Surgery, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Clinical Research Center, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Clinical Research Center, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Animal Research Center, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Scientific Research Institute, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Scientific Research Institute, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Clinical Research Center, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."

Methods: Tumor-bearing mice and normal mice were administered different doses of FFCT. The tumor volume of tumor-bearing mice was observed. The levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the blood, spleen, and tumor of mice were determined using a flow cytometer. The bacterial microbiota in stool samples from mice and the serum metabolomics of FFCT-treated mice and fecal microbiota transplantation mice were detected using 16s RNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS), respectively. Results: The tumor volume of mice showed no significant decrease after FFCT intervention. The levels of CD4+ and CD8+T lymphocytes showed a significant increase under the intervention of FFCT. GM of colorectal tumor-bearing mice and healthy mice were determined, and the diversity and abundance of Firmicutes, Deferribacteres, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were significantly different between the two groups. Furthermore, we found that the levels of matrine, isogingerenone B, and armillaripin were significantly decreased in tumor-bearing mice after FFCT intervention, indicating that the tumor-induced dysbiosis of gut bacteria may affect the absorption and metabolism of FFCT. Under the intervention of FFCT, serum metabolism of mice transplanted with feces from CRC patients showed less metabolites related to FFCT than that from healthy people, indicating that GM could be a single factor affecting the metabolism of FFCT. Furthermore, we found that different doses of FFCT-treated mice had higher abundance of Roseburia, Turicibacter, and Flexispira than that in the non-intervention control group. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in FFCT-treated groups showed a similar trend compared to the healthy group, indicating that FFCT might correct the intestinal microenvironment by modulating gut microbiota in colorectal tumor-bearing mice.

As there are no effective biomarkers for the early diagnosis and intervention tracking, the incidence of CC is increasing every year. Cholesterol is an important component of cell membrane, and it has been shown to be associated with CC. Oxysterol is an oxidized derivative of cholesterol, which plays an important role in many malignant tumors. In this study, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to determine serum cholesterol and ten oxysterol metabolites related to cholesterol in CC patients and healthy controls, and qualitative and quantitative analyses were carried out. Raw data were processed and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.3.0 and the MetaboAnalyst 5.0 platform (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/ModuleView.xhtml). To perform the independent sample t-test, it was necessary to ensure that all the sample data followed a normal distribution; therefore, the normal distribution test was performed in advance. The Mann-Whitney U test, which is a nonparametric test, was adopted for samples without a normal distribution. For the processed data, we used the statistical analysis function module of the MetaboAnalyst 5.0 platform to perform partial least-square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least-square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Both PLS-DA and OPLS-DA are supervised discriminant analysis methods. The OPLS-DA model is based on the PLS-DA model and eliminates variables that are unrelated to the experiment. In both models, the samples from the two groups were well separated by the score plot. In the PLS-DA model, the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the score plot represent the interpretation rates of the principal components of the model. The horizontal coordinates show the differences between groups, and the vertical coordinates show the differences within groups. In addition to the score plot in the PLS-DA model, another crucial factor is variable importance in the projection (VIP). When VIP>1, the compound makes an important contribution to the model and is also used as a criterion for screening differential metabolites. Based on 10-fold cross-validation (CV) of the PLS-DA model, the performance of the model was the best when the number of components was three. To avoid overfitting of the data, three metabolic markers were selected by using not only the VIP values of metabolites of the PLS-DA model, but also the optimal compositions and K-mean clusters. The three biomarkers were 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4β-OHC), cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol (Triol), and cholesterol. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed. The area under the curve (AUC) was generally between 0.5 and 1.0. In the case of AUC>0.5, the closer the AUC is to 1, the better is the performance of the model. In this study, the area under the ROC curve constructed jointly by the three metabolic markers was 0.998, indicating that their combined ability to predict CC was strong and that the diagnostic performance was excellent. In addition, to understand the role of the three metabolic markers in the pathogenesis of CC, the genes associated with the metabolic markers were identified using GeneCards (https://www.genecards.org/). Finally, 110 genes were identified. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used to analyze the biological processes, metabolic pathways, and possible roles in the body. GO enrichment showed that the three markers are mainly distributed in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and coated vesicles, and they are mainly involved in biological processes such as cholesterol metabolism, transportation, and low-density lipoprotein particle remodeling. Their molecular functions are cholesterol transfer activity and low-density lipoprotein particle receptor binding. KEGG pathway analysis showed that biomarkers are enriched in steroid biosynthesis, PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) signaling pathways, and ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transport pathways. The results of this study are helpful to understand the role of cholesterol and oxysterol in the pathogenesis of CC and to elucidate the pathogenesis of CC.","2022","2022 Jun","Zhanjun Ma; Zhenguo Li; Huan Wang; Renjun Wang; Xiaofei Han","College of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University, Key Laboratory of Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism Research, Key Laboratory of Dalian Synthetic Biology, Dalian 116622, China.; The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, China.; College of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University, Key Laboratory of Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism Research, Key Laboratory of Dalian Synthetic Biology, Dalian 116622, China.; College of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University, Key Laboratory of Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism Research, Key Laboratory of Dalian Synthetic Biology, Dalian 116622, China.; College of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University, Key Laboratory of Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism Research, Key Laboratory of Dalian Synthetic Biology, Dalian 116622, China."

Here, we evaluated the effects of the MPs and NPs on normal human intestinal CCD-18Co cells. Our results show that internalization of NPs and MPs induces metabolic changes under both acute and chronic exposure by inducing oxidative stress, increasing glycolysis via lactate to sustain energy metabolism and glutamine metabolism to sustain anabolic processes. We also show that this decoupling of nutrients mirrors the effect of the potent carcinogenic agent azoxymethane and HCT15 colon cancer cells, carrying out the typical strategy of cancer cells to optimize nutrients utilization and allowing metabolic adaptation to environmental stress conditions.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether L. plantarum-12 could ameliorate the colon cancer symptoms of azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS-treated C57BL/6 mice. The results showed that L. plantarum-12 alleviated colonic shortening (from 7.43 ± 0.15 to 8.23 ± 0.25) and weight loss (from 25.92 ± 0.21 to 27.75 ± 0.88) in AOM/DSS-treated mice. L. plantarum-12 oral administration down-regulated pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α (from 350.41 ± 15.80 to 247.72 ± 21.91), IL-8 (from 322.19 ± 11.83 to 226.08 ± 22.06), and IL-1β (111.43 ± 8.14 to 56.90 ± 2.70) levels and up-regulated anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 (from 126.08 ± 24.92 to 275.89 ± 21.87) level of AOM/DSS-treated mice. L. plantarum-12 oral administration restored the intestinal microbiota dysbiosis of the AOM/DSS treated mice by up-regulating beneficial Muribaculaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Bifidobacteriaceae levels and down-regulating pathogenic Proteobacteria, Desulfovibrionaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae levels. As a result, the fecal metabolites of the AOM/DSS-treated mice were altered, including xanthosine, uridine, 3,4-methylenesebacic acid, 3-hydroxytetradecanedioic acid, 4-hydroxyhexanoylglycine, beta-leucine, and glycitein, by L. plantarum-12 oral administration. Furthermore, L. plantarum-12 oral administration significantly ameliorated the colon injury of the AOM/DSS-treated mice by enhancing colonic tight junction protein level and promoting tumor cells death via down-regulating PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and up-regulating pro-apoptotic Bax. (p < 0.05). Taken together, L. plantarum-12 oral administration could ameliorate the colon cancer burden and inflammation of AOM-DSS-treated C57BL/6 mice through regulating the intestinal microbiota, manipulating fecal metabolites, enhancing colon barrier function, and inhibiting NF-κB signaling. These results suggest that L. plantarum-12 might be an excellent probiotic candidate for the prevention of colon cancer.","2022","2022 May 03","Fenglian Ma; Mengying Sun; Yinglong Song; Arong Wang; Shujuan Jiang; Fang Qian; Guangqing Mu; Yanfeng Tuo","School of Food Science and Technology, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; Dalian Probiotics Function Research Key Laboratory, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; School of Food Science and Technology, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; Dalian Probiotics Function Research Key Laboratory, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; School of Food Science and Technology, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; Dalian Probiotics Function Research Key Laboratory, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; School of Food Science and Technology, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; Dalian Probiotics Function Research Key Laboratory, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; School of Food Science and Technology, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; Dalian Probiotics Function Research Key Laboratory, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; School of Food Science and Technology, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; Dalian Probiotics Function Research Key Laboratory, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; School of Food Science and Technology, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; Dalian Probiotics Function Research Key Laboratory, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; School of Food Science and Technology, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China.; Dalian Probiotics Function Research Key Laboratory, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian 116034, China."

Our SCMS results indicate that Iri-resistant cancer cells possess higher levels of unsaturated lipids compared with the regular cancer cells. In addition, multiple protein biomarkers and their corresponding mRNAs of colon cancer stem cells are overexpressed in Iri-resistance cells. Particularly, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is upregulated with the development of drug resistance in Iri-resistant cells, whereas inhibiting the activity of SCD1 efficiently increase their sensitivity to Iri treatment.

Sodium butyrate (NaB) dose-dependently inhibits the growth of CRC HCT116 cells. NaB inhibits NRF2/NRF2-target genes and blocks NRF2-ARE signaling. NaB increases NRF2 negative regulator KEAP1 expression through inhibiting its promoter methylation. Associative analysis of DEGs (differentially expressed genes) from RNA-seq and DMRs (differentially methylated regions) from CpG methyl-seq identified the tumor suppressor gene ABCA1 and tumor promote gene EGR3 are correlated with their promoters' CpG methylation indicating NaB regulates cancer markers through modulating their promoter methylation. NaB activated the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle while inhibited the methionine metabolism which are both tightly coupled to the epigenetic machinery. NaB regulates the epigenetic enzymes/genes including DNMT1, HAT1, KDM1A, KDM1B, and TET1. Altogether, B's regulation of metabolites coupled to the epigenetic enzymes illustrates the potential underlying biological connectivity between metabolomics and epigenomics.

Sturgeon, the largest soft bone animal with ~20% cartilage content, is a great candidate for CS production. Our recent study confirmed the role of sturgeon chondroitin sulfate (SCS) in reducing colorectal cancer cell proliferation and tumor formation. Here, we further studied the effect of SCS on modulating gut microbiome structure in colorectal cancer bearing mice. In this study, the transplanted tumor mice model was constructed to demonstrate that SCS can effectively halt the growth of transplanted colorectal tumor cells. Next, we showed that SCS significantly altered the gut microbiome, such as the abundance of Lactobacillales, Gastranaerophilales, Ruminiclostridiun_5 and Ruminiclostridiun_6. According to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and abundance map analysis of the microbial metabolic pathways, the changes in microbial abundance led to an increase of certain metabolites (e.g., Phe, Tyr, and Gly). Fecal metabolome results demonstrated that SCS can significantly reduce the amount of certain amino acids such as Phe, Pro, Ala, Tyr and Leu presented in the feces, suggesting that SCS might inhibit colorectal cancer growth by modulating the gut microbiome and altering the production of certain amino acids.

Previously, hyperglycemia, the DM hallmark, has been shown to lead to aberrant glycosylation of CRC cells, heightening their malignancy both in vivo and in vitro. Here we use mass spectrometry to elucidate the composition and putative structures of N-glycans expressed by MC38 cultured in normoglycemic (LG) and hyperglycemic-like conditions (HG). N-glycans, 67, were identified in MC38 cells cultured in LG and HG. The cells grown in HG showed a greater abundance of N-glycans when compared to LNG cells, without changes in the proportion of sialylated, fucosylated and mannosylated N-glycans. Among the identified N-glycans, 16 were differentially expressed, mostly mannosylated and fucosylated, with a minority of them being sialylated. Metabolomics analysis indicates that the alterations observed in the N-glycosylation may be mostly due to increase of the activated monosaccharides pool, through an increased glucose entrance into the cells.

Identifying metabolic changes as vulnerabilities opens up novel approaches for the prevention or targeting of acquired therapy resistance. Insights into metabolic alterations underlying ruthenium-based chemotherapy resistance remain widely elusive. In this study, colon cancer HCT116 and pancreatic cancer Capan-1 cells were selected for resistance against the clinically evaluated ruthenium complex sodium trans-[tetrachlorobis(1H-indazole)ruthenate(III)] (BOLD-100). Gene expression profiling identified transcriptional deregulation of carbohydrate metabolism as a response to BOLD-100 and in resistance against the drug. Mechanistically, acquired BOLD-100 resistance is linked to elevated glucose uptake and an increased lysosomal compartment, based on a defect in downstream autophagy execution. Congruently, metabolomics suggested stronger glycolytic activity, in agreement with the distinct hypersensitivity of BOLD-100-resistant cells to 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG). In resistant cells, 2-DG induced stronger metabolic perturbations associated with ER stress induction and cytoplasmic lysosome deregulation. The combination with 2-DG enhanced BOLD-100 activity against HCT116 and Capan-1 cells and reverted acquired BOLD-100 resistance by synergistic cell death induction and autophagy disturbance. This newly identified enhanced glycolytic activity as a metabolic vulnerability in BOLD-100 resistance suggests the targeting of glycolysis as a promising strategy to support BOLD-100 anticancer activity.","2022","2022 Jan 20","Dina Baier; Beatrix Schoenhacker-Alte; Mate Rusz; Christine Pirker; Thomas Mohr; Theresa Mendrina; Dominik Kirchhofer; Samuel M Meier-Menches; Katharina Hohenwallner; Martin Schaier; Evelyn Rampler; Gunda Koellensperger; Petra Heffeter; Bernhard Keppler; Walter Berger","Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Center for Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine I, Medical University Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Research Cluster ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Center for Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine I, Medical University Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Research Cluster ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Center for Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine I, Medical University Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Research Cluster ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Center for Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine I, Medical University Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Center for Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine I, Medical University Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Research Cluster ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Center for Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine I, Medical University Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Center for Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine I, Medical University Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Research Cluster ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Research Cluster ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Center for Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine I, Medical University Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Research Cluster ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", 1090 Vienna, Austria."

Screening programs facilitate early diagnosis and can help to reduce poor outcomes. Serum metabolomics can extract vital molecular information that may increase the sensitivity and specificity of colonoscopy in combination with histopathological examination. The present study identifies serum metabolite patterns of treatment-naïve patients, diagnosed with either advanced adenoma (AA) or CRC in colonoscopy screenings, in the framework of the SAKKOPI (Salzburg Colon Cancer Prevention Initiative) program. We used a targeted flow injection analysis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics approach (FIA- and LC-MS/MS) to characterise the serum metabolomes of an initial screening cohort and two validation cohorts (in total 66 CRC, 76 AA and 93 controls). The lipidome was significantly perturbed, with a proportion of lipid species being downregulated in CRC patients, as compared to AA and controls. The predominant alterations observed were in the levels of lyso-lipids, glycerophosphocholines and acylcarnitines, but additionally, variations in the quantity of hydroxylated sphingolipids could be detected. Changed amino acid metabolism was restricted mainly to metabolites of the arginine/dimethylarginine/NO synthase pathway. The identified metabolic divergences observed in CRC set the foundation for mechanistic studies to characterise biochemical pathways that become deregulated during progression through the adenoma to carcinoma sequence and highlight the key importance of lipid metabolites. Biomarkers related to these pathways could improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis, as well as the monitoring of therapies.","2022","2022 Jan 29","Julia Tevini; Sebastian K Eder; Ursula Huber-Schönauer; David Niederseer; Georg Strebinger; Johanna M Gostner; Elmar Aigner; Christian Datz; Thomas K Felder","Department of Laboratory Medicine, Paracelsus Medical University, 5020 Salzburg, Austria.; First Department of Medicine, Paracelsus Medical University, 5020 Salzburg, Austria.; Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Oberndorf, Teaching Hospital of the Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, 5110 Oberndorf, Austria.; Department of Cardiology, University Heart Center Zurich, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Oberndorf, Teaching Hospital of the Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, 5110 Oberndorf, Austria.; Institute of Medical Biochemistry, Innsbruck Medical University, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.; First Department of Medicine, Paracelsus Medical University, 5020 Salzburg, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Oberndorf, Teaching Hospital of the Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, 5110 Oberndorf, Austria.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Paracelsus Medical University, 5020 Salzburg, Austria."

Clinical translation of these findings to at-risk patients might provide valuable quality-of-life benefits by delaying surgical interventions and drug therapies with adverse side effects.","2022","2022 Feb 07","Ying-Shiuan Chen; Jia Li; Sultan Neja; Sabeeta Kapoor; Jorge Enrique Tovar Perez; Chakrapani Tripathi; Rani Menon; Arul Jayaraman; Kyongbum Lee; Wan Mohaiza Dashwood; Shan Wang; Ke Zhang; Koichi Kobayashi; Praveen Rajendran; Roderick Dashwood","Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Texas A&M Health, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Texas A&M Health, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Texas A&M Health, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Texas A&M Health, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Texas A&M Health, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Texas A&M Health, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Department of Chemical Engineering, College of Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77840, USA.; Department of Chemical Engineering, College of Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77840, USA.; Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Tufts University, Medford, MA 02155, USA.; Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Texas A&M Health, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA.; Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Texas A&M Health, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Department of Immunology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo 060-8638, Japan.; Department of Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunology, Texas A&M Health Science Center, Bryan, TX 77087, USA.; Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Texas A&M Health, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Department of Translational Medical Sciences, and Antibody & Biopharmaceutics Core, Texas A&M College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Texas A&M Health, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Department of Translational Medical Sciences, and Antibody & Biopharmaceutics Core, Texas A&M College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."

Here, we characterized the mode of action of ADC costing of a TWEAKR-specific monoclonal antibody conjugated to a small molecule kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitor (KSPi). These TWEAKR-KSPi-ADCs showed strong efficacy in a TWEAKR expressing CT26 colon cancer model in mice. TWEAKR-KSPi-ADCs controlled the growth of CT26 colon cancers in immunodeficient as well as in immunocompetent mice. However, when treated with suboptimal doses, TWEAKR-KSPi-ADCs were still active in immunocompetent but not in immunodeficient mice, indicating that TWEAKR-KSPi-ADCs act - in addition to the cytotoxic mode of action - through an immunological mechanism. Indeed, in vitro experiments performed with a cell-permeable small molecule KSPi closely related to the active payload released from the TWEAKR-KSPi-ADCs revealed that KSPi was capable of stimulating several hallmarks of immunogenic cell death (ICD) on three different human cancer cell lines: cellular release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and high mobility group B1 protein (HMGB1), exposure of calreticulin on the cell surface as well as a transcriptional type-I interferon response. Further, in vivo experiments confirmed that treatment with TWEAKR-KSPi-ADCs activated immune responses via enhancing the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in tumors and the local production of interferon-γ, interleukin-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α. In conclusion, the antineoplastic effects of TWEAKR-KSPi-ADCs can partly be attributed to its ICD-stimulatory properties.","2022","2022","Anette Sommer; Sandra Berndt; Hans-Georg Lerchen; Sabrina Forveille; Allan Sauvat; Dominik Mumberg; Guido Kroemer; Oliver Kepp","Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.; Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.; Vincerx Pharma GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany.; Bayer AG, Wuppertal, Germany.; Equipe Labellisée Par la Ligue Contre le Cancer, Université de Paris, Sorbonne Université, INSERM UMR1138, Centre de Recherche Des Cordeliers, Paris, France.; Metabolomics and Cell Biology Platforms, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.; Equipe Labellisée Par la Ligue Contre le Cancer, Université de Paris, Sorbonne Université, INSERM UMR1138, Centre de Recherche Des Cordeliers, Paris, France.; Metabolomics and Cell Biology Platforms, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.; Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.; Equipe Labellisée Par la Ligue Contre le Cancer, Université de Paris, Sorbonne Université, INSERM UMR1138, Centre de Recherche Des Cordeliers, Paris, France.; Metabolomics and Cell Biology Platforms, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.; Suzhou Institute for Systems Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Suzhou, China.; Pôle de Biologie, Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou, AP-HP, Paris, France.; Karolinska Institutet, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Equipe Labellisée Par la Ligue Contre le Cancer, Université de Paris, Sorbonne Université, INSERM UMR1138, Centre de Recherche Des Cordeliers, Paris, France.; Metabolomics and Cell Biology Platforms, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France."

Identifying a novel and more effective platform with fewer side effects is still progress. In various cancer types, Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Src (a key mediator in EGFR signaling pathway) are the key targets for cancer therapy. Moreover, insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (IRTKS or BAI1-associated protein 2-like 1: BAIAP2L1) is a member of the subfamily of inverse BAR (I-BAR) domain proteins, which mediates cell morphology and movement through regulation of actin polymerization. In this study, we employed a co-culture system using Transwell six-well plates. After 72 h, hAMSCs-treated HT-29 cells, EGFR, c-Src, IRTKS, p38, and ERK1/2 expression were analyzed using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot methods. The significant reduction in tumor cell growth and motility through downregulation of EGFR/c-Src/IRTKS expression and p38/ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HT-29 cells was demonstrated based on 2D and 3D cell culture models. The induction of cellular apoptosis was also found. Our results support the idea that the hAMSCS secretome has therapeutic effects on cancer cells.

We previously reported that a Sanghuangporus vaninii extract could lead to apoptosis in HT-29 cells through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. We further found that Inoscavin A exhibited anti-colon cancer activity, but its specific mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Inoscavin A was obtained from Sanghuangporus vaninii by the classic phytochemical separation technology. The male BALB/c nude mice were injected with HT-29 colon cancer cells as animal model. In order to observe the pathological changes of tumor section, the hematoxylin-eosin(H&E) staining was applied in the histological analysis. Metabolomics was utilized for the investigation of the overall changes of serum metabolites in animal model, and the potential targets of Inoscavin A were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). We further employed a molecular docking approach to predict the degree of combination of Inoscavin A and Smo. Then we further performed Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis to investigate the expression of proteins involved in Hh-related pathways in tumor tissues. In addition, the colony formation assay, scratch-wound assay and transwell migration and invasion assay were conducted to evaluate the anti-colon-cancer activity of Inoscavin A. Concurrently, the mitochondrial membrane potential assay and TUNEL apoptosis assay were detected to demonstrate the effect of Inoscavin A on promoting HT-29 cells apoptosis. Western blot experiments verified the anti-tumor effects of Inoscavin A were modulated the protein expression of Shh, Ptch1, Smo and Gli1 in HT-29 cells. We showed that Inoscavin A, a pyrone compound isolated from the Sanghuangporus vaninii extract, exerted its antitumor activity in an HT-29 colon cancer cell xenograft mouse model. Subsequently, we first time prove that the antitumor effects of Inoscavin A were related to the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Smo, the core receptor of the Hh pathway, was critical for the induction of apoptosis of Inoscavin A and that overexpression of this target could significantly rescue cell apoptosis induced by Inoscavin A treatment. Thus, our studies first propose that the natural outgrowth Inoscavin A exerted its anti-cancer effects by inhibiting Smo to suppress the activity of the Hh pathway though inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. These findings further indicate that Inoscavin A will be expected to be a prospective remedical compound for the treatment of colon cancer.","2022","2022 Feb","Ping Qiu; Jingqun Liu; Lisha Zhao; Pinghu Zhang; Weike Wang; Dan Shou; Jinjun Ji; Changyu Li; Kequn Chai; Yu Dong","Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hang zhou, China.; Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hang zhou, China.; Department of Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hang zhou 310007, China.; Medical College, Yangzhou University, Yang zhou, China.; Hangzhou Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hang zhou, China.; Department of Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hang zhou 310007, China.; Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hang zhou, China.; Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hang zhou, China.; Department of Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hang zhou 310007, China.

Gut microbes signal via metabolites, but how the metabolites impact CRC is largely unknown. We interrogated fecal metabolites associated with mouse models of colon tumorigenesis with varying mutational load. We find that microbial metabolites from healthy mice or humans are growth-repressive, and this response is attenuated in mice and patients with CRC. Microbial profiling reveals that Lactobacillus reuteri and its metabolite, reuterin, are downregulated in mouse and human CRC. Reuterin alters redox balance, and reduces proliferation and survival in colon cancer cells. Reuterin induces selective protein oxidation and inhibits ribosomal biogenesis and protein translation. Exogenous Lactobacillus reuteri restricts colon tumor growth, increases tumor reactive oxygen species, and decreases protein translation in vivo.

Chemotherapy results in drug resistance in some cases; hence, herbal medicines are sometimes used in adjunct with it. Eugenol has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Metabolomics is a study of metabolic changes within an organism using high-throughput technology. The purpose of this research was to investigate the anticancer effects of eugenol and variations in p53, KRAS, and APC gene expression and metabolic changes associated with the abovementioned gene expressions using 1HNMR spectroscopy. The MTT method was used to determine cell viability and its IC50 detected. After treating HT-29 cells with IC50 concentration of eugenol, RNA was extracted and cDNA was obtained from them and the expression of p53, KRAS, and APC genes was measured using the qRT-PCR technique. Metabolites were extracted using the chloroform-ethanol method, lyophilized, and sent for 1HNMR spectroscopy using the 1D-NOESY protocol. Chemometrics analysis such as PLS-DA was performed, and differentiated metabolites were identified using the Human Metabolome Database. Integrated metabolic analysis using the metabolites and gene expression was performed by the MetaboAnalyst website. The observed IC50 for eugenol was 500 μM, and the relative expression of APC and p53 genes in the treated cells increased compared to the control group, and the expression of KRAS oncogene gene decreased significantly. The crucial changes in convergent metabolic phenotype with genes were identified.

The aim of the present study was to clarify the contribution of liver and gut microbiota to BA metabolism disturbance in cancer cachexia and to check the possibility of targeting BA metabolism using agents such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) for cancer cachexia therapy. The BA profiles in liver, intestine, and serum of mice with cancer cachexia induced by inoculation of colon C26 tumour cells were analysed using metabolomics methods and compared with that of control mice. Proteomic analysis of liver protein expression profile and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of gut microbiota composition in cancer cachexia mice were conducted. Expression levels of genes related to farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signalling pathway in the intestine and liver tissues were analysed using RT-PCR analysis. The BA profiles in serum of clinical colon cancer patients with or without cachexia were also analysed and compared with that of healthy volunteers. The effects of TUDCA in treating cancer cachexia mice were observed. In the liver of cancer cachexia mice, expression of BA synthesis enzymes was inhibited while the amount of total BAs increased (P < 0.05). The ratios of conjugated BAs/un-conjugated BAs significantly increased in cancer cachexia mice liver (P < 0.01). Gut microbiota dysbiosis such as decrease in Lachnospiraceae and increase in Enterobacteriaceae was observed in the intestine of cancer cachexia mice, and microbial metabolism of BAs was reduced. Increase in expression of FGF15 in intestine (P < 0.01) suggested the activation of FXR signalling pathway which might contribute to the regulation of BA synthesis enzymes, transporters, and metabolic enzymes. Increase in the BA conjugation was observed in the serum of cancer cachexia mice. Results of clinical patients showed changes in BA metabolism, especially the increase in BA conjugation, and also suggested compensatory mechanism in BA metabolism regulation. Oral administration of 50 mg/kg TUDCA could significantly ameliorate the decrease in body weight (P < 0.001), muscle loss (P < 0.001), and atrophy of heart and liver (P < 0.05) in cancer cachexia mice without influence on tumour growth. Bile acid metabolism dysregulation such as decrease in BA synthesis, increase in BA conjugation, and decrease in BA microbial metabolism was involved in development of cancer cachexia in mice. Targeting BA metabolism using agents such as TUDCA might be helpful for cancer cachexia therapy.","2021","2021 Dec","Lixing Feng; Wanli Zhang; Qiang Shen; Chunxiao Miao; Lijuan Chen; Yiwei Li; Xiaofan Gu; Meng Fan; Yushui Ma; Hui Wang; Xuan Liu; Xiongwen Zhang","Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.; Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Oncology, The Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.; Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China."

Accurate determination of ACs remains challenging due to their low abundance, high structure diversity, and limited availability of standard compounds. In this study, microwave-assisted Tmt-PP (p-[3,5-(dimethylamino)-2,4,6-triazine] benzene-1-sulfonyl piperazine) derivatization was utilized to facilitate the liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) determination of ACs. The result indicated that Tmt-PP labeling enables the prediction of the retention time and MS response of ACs and enhances their MS response up to 4 times. The introduction of the microwave during the derivatization procedure greatly improved the reaction efficiency, demonstrated by the shortened reaction time from 90 to 1 min. Furthermore, we applied a strategy named quantitative analysis of multi-components by a single marker (QAMS) for the assay of 26 ACs with only 5 AC standards, solving the standard availability issue to a large extent. The established workflow was applied to discover dysregulated ACs in xenograft colon cancer mice, and the quantification results were highly comparable with traditional methods where there were the corresponding standards for each AC. Our study demonstrated that chemical derivatization-based LC-MS/MS integrated with the QAMS strategy is robust for the identification and quantification of ACs and has great potential in targeted metabolomics study.","2021","2021 Sep 28","Tian Tang; Pei Zhang; Siqi Li; Doudou Xu; Wei Li; Yuan Tian; Yu Jiao; Zunjian Zhang; Fengguo Xu","Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance (Ministry of Education), State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicine, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, P.

We sought to gain insight into the mechanisms of cancer suppression by the MDD diet and to identify biomarkers of cancer risk reduction. A plasma metabolomic analysis was performed on ApcΔ14/+ mice maintained on either a methyl donor sufficient (MDS) diet or the protective MDD diet. A group of MDS animals was also pair-fed with the MDD mice to normalize caloric intake, and another group was shifted from an MDD to MDS diet to determine the durability of the metabolic changes. In addition to the anticipated changes in folate one-carbon metabolites, plasma metabolites related to fatty acid metabolism were generally decreased by the MDD diet, including carnitine, acylcarnitines, and fatty acids. Some fatty acid selectivity was observed; the levels of cancer-promoting arachidonic acid and 2-hydroxyglutarate were decreased by the MDD diet, whereas eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels were increased. Machine-learning elastic net analysis revealed a positive association between the fatty acid-related compounds azelate and 7-hydroxycholesterol and tumor development, and a negative correlation with succinate and β-sitosterol. Methyl donor restriction causes dramatic changes in systemic fatty acid metabolism. Regulating fatty acid metabolism through methyl donor restriction favorably effects fatty acid profiles to achieve cancer protection.","2021","2021 Sep 03","Oladimeji Aladelokun; Matthew Hanley; Jinjian Mu; John C Giardina; Daniel W Rosenberg; Charles Giardina","Center for Molecular Oncology, University of Connecticut Health Center, The University of Connecticut School of Medicine, 263 Farmington Ave., Farmington, CT, 06030-3101, USA. oladimeji.aladelokun@uconn.edu.; Center for Molecular Oncology, University of Connecticut Health Center, The University of Connecticut School of Medicine, 263 Farmington Ave., Farmington, CT, 06030-3101, USA.; Statistical Consulting Services, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA.; Center for Health Decision Science, Harvard T.H.

We examined the role of high-fat diet (HFD) in driving CRC through modulating gut microbiota and metabolites. HFD or control diet was fed to mice littermates in CRC mouse models of an azoxymethane (AOM) model and Apcmin/+ model, with or without antibiotics cocktail treatment. Germ-free mice for fecal microbiota transplantation were used for validation. Gut microbiota and metabolites were detected using metagenomic sequencing and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Gut barrier function was determined using lipopolysaccharides level and transmission electron microscopy. HFD promoted colorectal tumorigenesis in both AOM-treated mice and Apcmin/+ mice compared with control diet-fed mice. Gut microbiota depletion using antibiotics attenuated colon tumor formation in HFD-fed mice. A significant shift of gut microbiota composition with increased pathogenic bacteria Alistipessp.Marseille-P5997 and Alistipessp.5CPEGH6, and depleted probiotic Parabacteroides distasonis, along with impaired gut barrier function was exhibited in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, HFD-modulated gut microbiota promotes colorectal tumorigenesis in AOM-treated germ-free mice, indicating gut microbiota was essential in HFD-associated colorectal tumorigenesis. Gut metabolites alteration, including elevated lysophosphatidic acid, which was confirmed to promote CRC cell proliferation and impair cell junction, was also observed in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, transfer of stools from HFD-fed mice to germ-free mice without interference increased colonic cell proliferation, impaired gut barrier function, and induced oncogenic genes expression. HFD drives colorectal tumorigenesis through inducing gut microbial dysbiosis, metabolomic dysregulation with elevated lysophosphatidic acid, and gut barrier dysfunction in mice.","2022","2022 Jan","Jia Yang; Hong Wei; Yunfei Zhou; Chun-Ho Szeto; Chuangen Li; Yufeng Lin; Olabisi O Coker; Harry Cheuk Hay Lau; Anthony W H Chan; Joseph J Y Sung; Jun Yu","Institute of Digestive Disease and The Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, CUHK Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Laboratory Animal Science, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China; Department of Precision Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.; Institute of Digestive Disease and The Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, CUHK Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Institute of Digestive Disease and The Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, CUHK Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Institute of Digestive Disease and The Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, CUHK Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Institute of Digestive Disease and The Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, CUHK Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Institute of Digestive Disease and The Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, CUHK Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Institute of Digestive Disease and The Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, CUHK Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Institute of Digestive Disease and The Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, CUHK Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Institute of Digestive Disease and The Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, CUHK Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.

Fibre foods fermented by gut microbiota produce metabolites that not only provide food for the colonic epithelium but also exert regulatory effects on colonic mucosal inflammation and proliferation. We describe methods used in a double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial with Alaska Native (AN) people to determine if dietary fibre supplementation can substantially reduce CRC risk among people with the highest reported CRC incidence worldwide. Eligible patients undergoing routine screening colonoscopy consent to baseline assessments and specimen/data collection (blood, urine, stool, saliva, breath and colon mucosal biopsies) at the time of colonoscopy. Following an 8-week stabilisation period to re-establish normal gut microbiota post colonoscopy, study personnel randomise participants to either a high fibre supplement (resistant starch, n=30) or placebo (digestible starch, n=30) condition, repeating stool sample collection. During the 28-day supplement trial, each participant consumes their usual diet plus their supplement under direct observation. On day 29, participants undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy to obtain mucosal biopsy samples to measure the effect of the supplement on inflammatory and proliferative biomarkers of cancer risk, with follow-up assessments and data/specimen collection similar to baseline. Secondary outcome measures include the impact of a high fibre supplement on the oral and colonic microbiome and biofluid metabolome. Approvals were obtained from the Alaska Area and University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Boards and Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and Southcentral Foundation research review bodies. A data safety monitoring board, material transfer agreements and weekly study team meetings provide regular oversight throughout the study. Study findings will first be shared with AN tribal leaders, health administrators, providers and community members.

To foster optimal model selection from a translational perspective, we performed untargeted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry-based polar metabolomics and lipidomics to non-transformed (CCD841-CON and FHC) and transformed (HCT116, HT29, Caco2, SW480 and SW948) colon cell lines as well as tissue samples from ten colorectal cancer patients. This unveiled metabolic signatures discriminating the transformed from the non-transformed state. Metabolites involved in glutaminolysis, tryptophan catabolism, pyrimidine, lipid and carnitine synthesis were elevated in transformed cells and cancerous tissue, whereas those involved in the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle, urea cycle and redox reactions were lowered. The degree of glutaminolysis and lipid synthesis was specific to the colon cancer cell line at hand. Thus, our study exposed pathways that are specifically associated with the transformation state and revealed differences between colon cancer cell lines that should be considered when targeting cancer-associated pathways.","2021","2021 Aug 26","Caroline Rombouts; Margot De Spiegeleer; Lieven Van Meulebroek; Lynn Vanhaecke; Winnok H De Vos","Laboratory of Chemical Analysis, Department of Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, 9820, Merelbeke, Belgium.; Department of Molecular Biotechnology, Cell Systems and Imaging, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.; Laboratory of Cell Biology and Histology, Department of Veterinary Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Antwerp University, Universiteitsplein 1, 2610, Wilrijk, Belgium.; Laboratory of Chemical Analysis, Department of Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, 9820, Merelbeke, Belgium.; Laboratory of Chemical Analysis, Department of Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, 9820, Merelbeke, Belgium.; Laboratory of Chemical Analysis, Department of Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, 9820, Merelbeke, Belgium.

However, the underlying metabolic basis remains to be determined. In the present study, we hypothesize that AOM treatment results in different plasma metabolomic responses in diet-induced obese mice. An untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed on the plasma samples by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). We found that 53 of 144 identified metabolites were different between the 4 groups of mice (AIN, AIN + AOM, HFD, HFD + AOM), and sparse partial least-squares discriminant analysis showed a separation between the HFD and HFD + AOM groups but not the AIN and AIN + AOM groups. Moreover, the concentrations of dihydrocholesterol and cholesterol were inversely associated with AOM-induced colonic ACF formation. Functional pathway analyses indicated that diets and AOM-induced colonic ACF modulated five metabolic pathways. Collectively, in addition to differential plasma metabolomic responses, AOM treatment decreases dihydrocholesterol and cholesterol levels and alters the composition of plasma metabolome to a greater extent in mice fed a HFD compared to the AIN.","2021","2021 Jul 09","Huawei Zeng; Shahid Umar; Zhenhua Liu; Michael R Bukowski","Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center, Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Grand Forks, ND 58203, USA.; Department of Surgery and University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.; School of Public Health and Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, USA.; Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center, Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Grand Forks, ND 58203, USA."

Here, combining MCA with Linear Programming, an efficient computational strategy is developed to infer additional non-measured changes at the molecular level that are required to satisfy these constraints. An application of this strategy is illustrated by using a set of fluxes, concentrations, and differentially expressed genes that characterize the response to cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibition in colon cancer cells. Decreases and increases in transporter and enzyme individual activities required to reprogram the measured changes in fluxes and concentrations are compared with down-regulated and up-regulated metabolic genes to unveil those that are key molecular drivers of the metabolic response.","2021","2021 Jul","Pedro de Atauri; Míriam Tarrado-Castellarnau; Josep Tarragó-Celada; Carles Foguet; Effrosyni Karakitsou; Josep Joan Centelles; Marta Cascante","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine & Institute of Biomedicine of Universitat de Barcelona, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Hepáticas y Digestivas (CIBEREHD) and Metabolomics node at Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB-ISCIII-ES-ELIXIR), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine & Institute of Biomedicine of Universitat de Barcelona, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Hepáticas y Digestivas (CIBEREHD) and Metabolomics node at Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB-ISCIII-ES-ELIXIR), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine & Institute of Biomedicine of Universitat de Barcelona, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine & Institute of Biomedicine of Universitat de Barcelona, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Hepáticas y Digestivas (CIBEREHD) and Metabolomics node at Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB-ISCIII-ES-ELIXIR), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine & Institute of Biomedicine of Universitat de Barcelona, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine & Institute of Biomedicine of Universitat de Barcelona, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Hepáticas y Digestivas (CIBEREHD) and Metabolomics node at Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB-ISCIII-ES-ELIXIR), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine & Institute of Biomedicine of Universitat de Barcelona, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Hepáticas y Digestivas (CIBEREHD) and Metabolomics node at Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB-ISCIII-ES-ELIXIR), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain."

In this study, we investigated whether a crude acetone extract of Momordica balsamina (MBE) can interfere with the metastatic ability of HT-29 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The phytochemical composition of MBE was determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and cytotoxic effects by the MTT and acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining assays. The effect of MBE on the formation of reactive oxygen species was assessed using the DCFH2 -DA assay. Wound healing assay, transwell cell invasion assay, cell adhesion assay, and the extracellular matrix-cell adhesion array were used to assess the antimetastatic effects of MBE. The effect of MBE on the expression of TNF-α, NF-κB, TIMP-3, MMP-2, and MMP-9 was assessed by western blot analysis. Our results showed that MBE consists of a mixture of compounds without a known anticancer activity in CRC and exhibits cytotoxicity against HT-29 cells. MBE also suppressed reactive oxygen species formation, cell invasion, cell migration, and cell adhesion. The reduction of cell invasion was associated with the downregulation of TNF-α, NF-κB, MMP2, and MMP9 and upregulation of TIMP-3 proteins.

Developments of efficient therapeutic strategies are required for the CAC treatments. This long-term process could be shortened by the drug-repositioning approach which exploits old drugs approved for non-cachexia disease. Amiloride, a diuretic drug, is clinically used for treatments of hypertension and edema due to heart failure. Here, we explored the effects of the amiloride treatment for ameliorating muscle wasting in murine models of cancer cachexia. The CT26 and LLC tumor cells were subcutaneously injected into mice to induce colon cancer cachexia and lung cancer cachexia, respectively. Amiloride was intraperitoneally injected daily once tumors were formed. Cachexia features of the CT26 model and the LLC model were separately characterized by phenotypic, histopathologic and biochemical analyses. Plasma exosomes and muscle atrophy-related proteins were quantitatively analyzed. Integrative NMR-based metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were conducted to identify significantly altered metabolic pathways and distinctly changed metabolism-related biological processes in gastrocnemius. The CT26 and LLC cachexia models displayed prominent cachexia features including decreases in body weight, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and muscle strength. The amiloride treatment in tumor-bearing mice distinctly alleviated muscle atrophy and relieved cachexia-related features without affecting tumor growth. Both the CT26 and LLC cachexia mice showed increased plasma exosome densities which were largely derived from tumors. Significantly, the amiloride treatment inhibited tumor-derived exosome release, which did not obviously affect exosome secretion from non-neoplastic tissues or induce observable systemic toxicities in normal healthy mice. Integrative-omics revealed significant metabolic impairments in cachectic gastrocnemius, including promoted muscular catabolism, inhibited muscular protein synthesis, blocked glycolysis, and impeded ketone body oxidation. The amiloride treatment evidently improved the metabolic impairments in cachectic gastrocnemius. Amiloride ameliorates cachectic muscle wasting and alleviates cancer cachexia progression through inhibiting tumor-derived exosome release. Our results are beneficial to understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms, shedding light on the potentials of amiloride in cachexia therapy.","2021","2021 Jul 06","Lin Zhou; Tong Zhang; Wei Shao; Ruohan Lu; Lin Wang; Haisheng Liu; Bin Jiang; Shiqin Li; Huiqin Zhuo; Suheng Wang; Qinxi Li; Caihua Huang; Donghai Lin","Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China.; Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China.; Xiamen Cardiovascular Hospital, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361000, China.; Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China.; Department of Oncology, Institute of Gastrointestinal Oncology, Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361004, China.; Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361102, China.; Department of Medical Oncology, Xiang'an Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.; Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, The Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361004, Fujian, China.; Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361102, China.; Research and Communication Center of Exercise and Health, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen, 361024, China. huangcaihua@xmut.edu.cn.; Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China. dhlin@xmu.edu.cn.; High-field NMR Center, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China. dhlin@xmu.edu.cn."

Here, we analyzed in detail the phospholipid (PL), lysophospholipid (lysoPL), and fatty acid (FA) profiles of purified EpCAM+ cells, isolated from tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues of colon cancer patients. We found that a number of FAs increased significantly in isolated tumor cells, which also included a number of long polyunsaturated FAs. Higher levels of FAs were associated with increased expression of FA synthesis genes, as well as with altered expression of enzymes involved in FA elongation and desaturation, including particularly fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, fatty acid desaturase 2 and ELOVL5 fatty acid elongase 5 We identified significant changes in ratios of specific lysoPLs and corresponding PLs. A number of lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine species, containing long-chain and very-long chain FAs, often with high numbers of double bonds, were significantly upregulated in tumor cells. Increased de novo synthesis of very long-chain FAs, or, altered uptake or incorporation of these FAs into specific lysoPLs in tumor cells, may thus contribute to reprogramming of cellular phospholipidome and membrane alterations observed in colon cancer.","2021","2021 Jun 22","Jiřina Hofmanová; Josef Slavík; Miroslav Ciganek; Petra Ovesná; Zuzana Tylichová; Martina Karasová; Ondřej Zapletal; Nicol Straková; Jiřina Procházková; Jan Bouchal; Zdeněk Kolář; Jiří Ehrmann; Monika Levková; Zlatka Hušková; Pavel Skalický; Alois Kozubík; Miroslav Machala; Jan Vondráček","Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Veterinary Research Institute, 621 00 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Veterinary Research Institute, 621 00 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.; Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, 602 00 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Veterinary Research Institute, 621 00 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Veterinary Research Institute, 621 00 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Clinical and Molecular Pathology, Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Palacký University and University Hospital, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic.; Department of Clinical and Molecular Pathology, Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Palacký University and University Hospital, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic.; Department of Surgery, University Hospital, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic.; Department of Clinical and Molecular Pathology, Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Palacký University and University Hospital, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic.; Department of Clinical and Molecular Pathology, Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Palacký University and University Hospital, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic.; Department of Surgery, University Hospital, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Veterinary Research Institute, 621 00 Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic."

Our aim was to define the mechanisms coupling fibrin(ogen) to CRC growth. CRC tumors transplanted into the dorsal subcutis of Fib- mice were less proliferative and demonstrated increased senescence relative to those grown in Fib+ mice. RNA-seq analyses of Fib+ and Fib- tumors revealed 213 differentially regulated genes. One gene highly upregulated in tumors from Fib- mice was stratifin, encoding 14-3-3σ, a master regulator of proliferation/senescence. In a separate cohort, we observed significantly increased protein levels of 14-3-3σ and its upstream and downstream targets (i.e., p53 and p21) in tumors from Fib- mice. In vitro analyses demonstrated increased tumor cell proliferation in a fibrin printed three-dimensional environment compared with controls, suggesting that fibrin(ogen) in the tumor microenvironment promotes tumor growth in this context via a tumor cell intrinsic mechanism. In vivo analyses showed diminished activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a key negative regulator of p53, in Fib- tumors. Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics demonstrated significantly reduced metabolic activity in tumors from Fib- relative to Fib+ mice. Together, these findings suggest that fibrin(ogen)-mediated engagement of colon cancer cells activates FAK, which inhibits p53 and its downstream targets including 14-3-3σ and p21, thereby promoting cellular proliferation and preventing senescence. These studies suggest that fibrin(ogen) is an important component of the colon cancer microenvironment and may be exploited as a potential therapeutic target.","2021","2021 Oct","Bal Krishan Sharma; Duaa Mureb; Sumit Murab; Leah Rosenfeldt; Brenton Francisco; Rachel Cantrell; Rebekah Karns; Lindsey Romick-Rosendale; Miki Watanabe-Chailland; Jacob Mast; Matthew J Flick; Patrick W Whitlock; Joseph S Palumbo","Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Division of Orthopaedics Surgery, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the UNC Blood Research Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; Division of Orthopaedics Surgery, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."

Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of autophagy inhibits cell growth in colon cancer-derived cell lines and patient-derived enteroid models. Importantly, normal colon epithelium and patient-derived normal enteroid growth were not decreased following autophagy inhibition. To couple the role of autophagy to cellular metabolism, a cell culture screen in conjunction with metabolomic analysis was performed. We identified a critical role of autophagy to maintain mitochondrial metabolites for growth. Loss of mitochondrial recycling through inhibition of mitophagy hinders colon cancer cell growth.

Serine metabolic reprogramming is a major feature of tumor metabolism. Yes-associated protein (YAP) participates in organ size control and tumorigenesis. However, the relationship between YAP and serine metabolism in colon cancer is unclear. In this study, RNA sequencing and metabolomics analyses indicated significant enrichment of the glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism pathways in serine starvation-resistant cells. Short-term serine deficiency inhibited YAP activation, whereas a prolonged response dephosphorylated YAP and promoted its activity. Mechanistically, USP7 increases YAP stability under increased serine conditions by regulating deubiquitination. Verteporfin (VP) effectively inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells and organoids and could even modulate serine metabolism by inhibiting USP7 expression. Clinically, YAP was significantly activated in colon tumor tissues and positively correlated with the expression of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and USP7. Generally, our study uncovered the mechanism by which serine metabolism regulates YAP via USP7 and identified the crucial role of YAP in the regulation of cell proliferation and tumor growth; thus, VP may be a new treatment for colon cancer.","2021","2021","Xiaoya Zhao; Jianfei Fu; Bin Hu; Lin Chen; Jing Wang; Jinyong Fang; Chenyang Ge; Haiping Lin; Kailing Pan; Liang Fu; Lude Wang; Jinlin Du; Wenxia Xu","Central Laboratory, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China.; Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Medical Oncology, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China.; Department of Pathology, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China.; Central Laboratory, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China.; Central Laboratory, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China.; Department of Science and Education, Jinhua Guangfu Oncology Hospital, Huancheng, Jinhua, China.; Department of Colorectal Surgery, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China.; Central Laboratory, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China.; Central Laboratory, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China.; Central Laboratory, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China.; Department of Nursing, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China.; Central Laboratory, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China.; Department of Colorectal Surgery, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China.; Central Laboratory, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China."

However, the development of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) in tumor chemotherapy has seriously reduced the therapeutic efficacy of Dox. Natural product curcumin (Cur) was demonstrated to have a variety of pharmacological effects, such as anti-tumor, anti-oxidation and anti-aging activities. Here, we examined the MDR reversal capability of Cur in drug sensitive-(SW620) and resistant-(SW620/Ad300) colon cancer cells, and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms at the metabolic level. It was found that Cur reversed P-gp-mediated resistance in SW620/Ad300 cells by enhancing the Dox-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Further mechanistic studies indicated that Cur inhibited the ATP-dependent transport activity of P-gp, thereby increasing the intra-celluar accumulation of Dox in drug-resistant cells. Metabolomics analysis based on UPLC-MS/MS showed that the MDR phenomenon in SW620/Ad300 cells was closely correlated with the upregulation of spermine and spermidine synthesis and D-glutamine metabolism. Cur significantly inhibited the biosynthesis of spermine and spermidine by decreasing the expression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and suppressed D-glutamine metabolism, which in turn decreased the anti-oxidative stress ability and P-gp transport activity of SW620/Ad300 cells, eventually reversed MDR. These findings indicated the MDR reversal activity and the related mechanism of action of Cur, suggesting that Cur could be a promising MDR reversal agent for cancer treatment.","2021","2021 Jul 15","Nan Zhang; Ming Gao; Zihan Wang; Jingxian Zhang; Weiqi Cui; Jinjin Li; Xiaolin Zhu; Hang Zhang; Dong-Hua Yang; Xia Xu","Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.

The current study investigated the effects of FFAR2 signaling on energy metabolism and gut microbiota profiling in a colorectal cancer mouse model (Apc Min/+ ). Ffar2 deficiency promoted colonic polyp development and enhanced fatty acid oxidation and bile acid metabolism. Gut microbiome sequencing analysis showed distinct clustering among wild-type, Apc Min/+ , and Apc Min/+ -Ffar2 -/- mice. The relative abundance of Flavobacteriaceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae was significantly increased in the Apc Min/+ -Ffar2 -/- mice compared to the Apc Min/+ mice. In addition, knocking-down FFAR2 in the human colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and HT29) resulted in increased expression of several key enzymes in fatty acid oxidation, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, C-2 to C-3 short chain, and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/enoyl-CoA hydratase, alpha subunit.

These studies emphasized that AT13387 downregulates HSP90 client proteins involved in oncogenic signaling and DNA repair mechanisms as major drivers of enhanced radiosensitivity. Given the large array of client proteins HSP90 directs, we hypothesized that other key proteins or signaling pathways may be inhibited by AT13387 and contribute to enhanced radiosensitivity. Metabolomic analysis of HSP90 inhibition by AT13387 was conducted to identify metabolic biomarkers of radiosensitization and whether modulations of key proteins were involved in IR-induced tumor vasculogenesis, a process involved in tumor recurrence. HNSCC and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines were used to evaluate the AT13387 radiosensitization effect in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot analysis were used to evaluate cell cycle changes and HSP90 client protein's role in DNA damage repair. Metabolic analysis was performed using liquid chromatography-Mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemical examination of resected tumors post-AT13387 and IR treatment were conducted to identify biomarkers of IR-induced tumor vasculogenesis. In agreement with recent studies, AT13387 treatment combined with IR resulted in a G2/M cell cycle arrest and inhibited DNA repair. Metabolomic profiling indicated a decrease in key metabolites in glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle by AT13387, a reduction in Adenosine 5'-triphosphate levels, and rate-limiting metabolites in nucleotide metabolism, namely phosphoribosyl diphosphate and aspartate. HNSCC xenografts treated with the combination exhibited increased tumor regrowth delay, decreased tumor infiltration of CD45 and CD11b+ bone marrow-derived cells, and inhibition of HIF-1 and SDF-1 expression, thereby inhibiting IR-induced vasculogenesis. AT13387 treatment resulted in pharmacologic inhibition of cancer cell metabolism that was linked to DNA damage repair. AT13387 combined with IR inhibited IR-induced vasculogenesis, a process involved in tumor recurrence postradiotherapy.

The 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) synthase 2 (PAPSS2) is the key enzyme to generate PAPS, which is the universal sulfonate donor for all sulfation reactions. The goal of this study was to determine whether and how PAPSS2 plays a role in colitis and colonic carcinogenesis. Tissue arrays of human colon cancer specimens, gene expression data, and clinical features of cancer patients were analyzed. Intestinal-specific Papss2 knockout mice (Papss2ΔIE) were created and subjected to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis and colonic carcinogenesis induced by a combined treatment of azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate or azoxymethane alone. The expression of PAPSS2 is decreased in the colon cancers of mice and humans. The lower expression of PAPSS2 in colon cancer patients is correlated with worse survival. Papss2ΔIE mice showed heightened sensitivity to colitis and colon cancer by damaging the intestinal mucosal barrier, increasing intestinal permeability and bacteria infiltration, and worsening the intestinal tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, the Papss2ΔIE mice exhibited reduced intestinal sulfomucin content. Metabolomic analyses revealed the accumulation of bile acids, including the Farnesoid X receptor antagonist bile acid tauro-β-muricholic acid, and deficiency in the formation of bile acid sulfates in the colon of Papss2ΔIE mice. We have uncovered an important role of PAPSS2-mediated sulfation in colitis and colonic carcinogenesis.

The integrated analysis transcriptomics and metabolomics was conducted using R programs and online tools, including ClusterProfiler R program, GSEA, Prognoscan and Cytoscape.

Structural maintenance of chromosome 3 (SMC3), Topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) and Glycogen phosphorylase B (PYGB) are the most significant DEGs which bring poor clinical prognosis in colon cancer. The analysis of metabolomics presented that most of the differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were amino acids, such as L-glutamine, DL-serine and aspartic acid. The joint analysis of DEGs and DAMs showed that they were mainly involved in protein digestion and absorption, ABC transporters, central carbon metabolism, choline metabolism and Gap junction.

However, its role in cancer development remains to be elucidated. The metabolic subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC) was recently established. We investigated ACO2's potential role in CRC progression through mediating metabolic alterations. We compared the mRNA and protein expression of ACO2 between paired CRC and non-tumor tissues from 353 patients. Correlations between ACO2 levels and clinicopathological features were examined. CRC cell lines with knockdown or overexpression of ACO2 were analyzed for cell proliferation and tumor growth. Metabolomics and stable isotope tracing analyses were used to study the metabolic alterations induced by loss of ACO2. ACO2 decreased in >50% of CRC samples compared with matched non-tumor tissues. Decreased ACO2 levels correlated with advanced disease stage (P < 0.001) and shorter patient survival (P < 0.001). Knockdown of ACO2 in CRC cells promoted cell proliferation and tumor formation, while ectopic expression of ACO2 restrained tumor growth. Specifically, blockade of ACO2 caused a reduction in TCA cycle intermediates and suppression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in an increase in glycolysis and elevated citrate flux for fatty acid and lipid synthesis. Increased citrate flux induced upregulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1), which enhanced lipid desaturation in ACO2-deficent cells to favor colorectal cancer growth. Pharmacological inhibition of SCD selectively reduced tumor formation of CRC with ACO2 deficiency. Our study demonstrated that the rewiring metabolic pathway maintains CRC survival during compromised TCA cycles and characterized the therapeutic vulnerability of lipid desaturation in a meaningful subset of CRC with mitochondrial dysfunction.","2021","2021 Jun","Xin You; Jingyu Tian; Hui Zhang; Yunhua Guo; Jing Yang; Chaofeng Zhu; Ming Song; Peng Wang; Zexian Liu; John Cancilla; Wenhua Lu; Christophe Glorieux; Shijun Wen; Hongli Du; Peng Huang; Yumin Hu","Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China; Department of Oncology, Molecular Oncology Research Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou 350005, Fujian, China.; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China; Sun Yat-sen University Metabolomics Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510080, China.; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China; Sun Yat-sen University Metabolomics Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510080, China.; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China; Sun Yat-sen University Metabolomics Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510080, China.; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China.; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China.; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China.; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China.; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China.; Scintillon Institute, San Diego, CA 92121, USA.; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China; Sun Yat-sen University Metabolomics Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510080, China.; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China.; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China.; School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510006, China.; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China; Sun Yat-sen University Metabolomics Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510080, China.; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China; Sun Yat-sen University Metabolomics Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510080, China.

This work aims at unraveling novel meat-associated mechanisms that are involved in disease development. A non-hypothesis driven strategy of untargeted metabolomics is applied to assess colon tissue from rats (fed a high dose of beef vs. white meat) and from pigs (fed red/processed meat vs. white meat), receiving a realistic human background diet. An increased carnitine metabolism is observed, which is reflected by higher levels of acylcarnitines and 3-dehydroxycarnitine (rats and pigs) and trimethylamine-N-oxide (rats). While 3-dehydroxycarnitine is higher in HT29 cells, incubated with colonic beef digests, acylcarnitine levels are reduced. This suggests an altered response from colon cancer cell line towards meat-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, metabolic differences between rat and pigs are observed in N-glycolylneuraminic acid incorporation, prostaglandin, and fatty acid synthesis. This study demonstrates elevated (acyl)carnitine metabolism in colon tissue of animals that follow a red meat-based diet, providing mechanistic insights that may aid in explaining the nutritional-physiological correlation between red/processed meat and Western diseases.","2021","2021 Apr","Caroline Rombouts; Lieven Van Meulebroek; Margot De Spiegeleer; Sophie Goethals; Thomas Van Hecke; Stefaan De Smet; Winnok H De Vos; Lynn Vanhaecke","Department of Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety, Laboratory of Chemical Analysis, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, 9820, Merelbeke, Belgium.; Department of Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety, Laboratory of Chemical Analysis, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, 9820, Merelbeke, Belgium.; Department of Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety, Laboratory of Chemical Analysis, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, 9820, Merelbeke, Belgium.; Department of Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety, Laboratory of Chemical Analysis, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, 9820, Merelbeke, Belgium.; Department of Animal Sciences and Aquatic Ecology, Laboratory for Animal Nutrition and Animal Product Quality, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.; Department of Animal Sciences and Aquatic Ecology, Laboratory for Animal Nutrition and Animal Product Quality, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.; Department of Animal Sciences and Aquatic Ecology, Laboratory for Animal Nutrition and Animal Product Quality, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.; Department of Molecular Biotechnology, Cell Systems & Imaging, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.; Department of Veterinary Sciences, Laboratory of Cell Biology and Histology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Antwerp, Campus Drie Eiken Universiteitsplein 1, 2610, Wilrijk, Belgium.; Department of Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety, Laboratory of Chemical Analysis, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, 9820, Merelbeke, Belgium.; School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University Belfast, Lisburn Road 97, Belfast, UK."

Dietary rice bran intake was shown to modify human stool metabolites as a result of modifications to metabolism by gut microbiota. In this study, human stool microbiota from colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors that consumed rice bran daily was examined by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for protection from azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) induced colon carcinogenesis in germ-free mice. Mice transfaunated with rice bran-modified microbiota communities (RMC) harbored fewer neoplastic lesions in the colon and displayed distinct enrichment of Flavonifractor and Oscillibacter associated with colon health, and the depletion of Parabacteroides distasonis correlated with increased tumor burden. Two anti-cancer metabolites, myristoylcarnitine and palmitoylcarnitine were increased in the colon of RMC transplanted mice. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and tartarate that are implicated in CRC development were reduced in murine colon tissue after FMT with rice bran-modified human microbiota. Findings from this study show that rice bran modified gut microbiota from humans confers protection from colon carcinogenesis in mice and suggests integrated dietary-FMT intervention strategies should be tested for colorectal cancer control, treatment, and prevention.","2021","2021 Feb 03","Kristopher D Parker; Akhilendra K Maurya; Hend Ibrahim; Sangeeta Rao; Petronella R Hove; Dileep Kumar; Rama Kant; Bupinder Raina; Rajesh Agarwal; Kristine A Kuhn; Komal Raina; Elizabeth P Ryan","Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.; Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig 44511, Egypt.; Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD 57007, USA.; Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA."

However, the systematic pathways involved in Shikonin intervention in human colon cancer has not yet clearly defined. This study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of Shikonin in colon cancer, as well as investigate the potential biomarkers from a global perspective and the possible antitumor mechanisms involved. In this work, cell viability, cell cycle and cell apoptosis in human colon cancer cells were assessed to evaluate the antitumor activity of Shikonin. Transcriptomics and metabolomics were integrated to provide the perturbed pathways and explore the potential mechanisms. The crucial proteins and genes involved were further validated by immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative PCR. Shikonin revealed a remarkable antitumor potency in colon cancer. Cell cycle was significantly arrested at the S phase as well as apoptosis was induced in SW480 cell line. Furthermore, a total of 1642 differentially expressed genes and 40 metabolites were detected after Shikonin intervention. The integrated analysis suggested that the antitumor effect was mainly attributed to purine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, pyrimidine metabolism, urea cycle and metabolism of amino acids. The up-regulated expression of proteins vital for arginine biosynthesis was subsequently validated by immunohistochemistry in xenograft mice. Notably, supplemental dNTPs and arginine could significantly reverse the cytotoxic effect induced by Shikonin and the genes participating in purine metabolism and arginine biosynthesis were further determined by RT-qPCR. Our findings provide a systematic perspective in the therapeutic effect of Shikonin which might lay a foundation for further research on Shikonin in colon cancer.","2021","2021 Feb","Yang Chen; Leting Si; Jinghui Zhang; Hengyuan Yu; Xuesong Liu; Yong Chen; Yongjiang Wu","College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.

Annona muricata L. (Graviola) which is belonging to the Annonaceae family has been traditionally used due to its medicinal abilities including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cancer cell growth inhibition. Graviola is claimed to be a potential antitumor due to its selective cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines. However, the metabolic mechanism information underlying the anticancer activity remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ionic liquid-Graviola fruit pulp extract (IL-GPE) on the metabolomics behavior of colon cancer (HT29) by using an untargeted GC-TOFMS-based metabolic profiling. Multivariate data analysis was used to determine the metabolic profiling, and the ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was used to predict the altered canonical pathways after treating the HT29 cells with crude IL-GPE and Taxol (positive control). The principal components analysis (PCA) identified 44 metabolites with the most reliable factor loading, and the cluster analysis (CA) separated three groups of metabolites: metabolites specific to the non-treated HT29 cells, metabolites specific to the treated HT29 cells with the crude IL-GPE and metabolites specific to Taxol treatment. Pathway analysis of metabolomic profiles revealed an alteration of many metabolic pathways, including amino acid metabolism, aerobic glycolysis, urea cycle and ketone bodies metabolism that contribute to energy metabolism and cancer cell proliferation. The crude IL-GPE can be one of the promising anticancer agents due to its selective inhibition of energy metabolism and cancer cell proliferation.","2021","2021 Apr 24","Djabir Daddiouaissa; Azura Amid; Muhamad Shirwan Abdullah Sani; Ahmed A M Elnour","Biotechnology Engineering Department, Kulliyyah of Engineering, International Islamic University, Malaysia (IIUM), P.

In this study, we compared fecal metabolites between age-matched and age-mismatched elderly subjects to examine the roles of the gut microbiota in the health of the elderly. Fecal metabolites in 16 elderly subjects who fell into an age-matched cluster (elderly-type gut microbiota group, E-GM) and another 16 elderly subjects who fell into an age-mismatched cluster (adult-type gut microbiota group, A-GM) were measured by CE-TOF-MS. A total of eight metabolites were significantly different between the groups: cholic acid and taurocholic acid were enriched in the A-GM group, whereas choline, trimethylamine (TMA), N8-acetylspermidine, propionic acid, 2-hydroxy-4-methylvaleric acid, and 5-methylcytosine were enriched in the E-GM group. Some metabolites (choline, TMA, N8-acetylspermidine) elevated in the E-GM group were metabolites or precursors reported as risk factors for age-associated diseases such as arteriosclerosis and colorectal cancer. The abundance of some species belongs to Proteobacteria, which were known as TMA-producing bacteria, was increased in the E-GM group and correlated with fecal TMA levels. In vitro assays showed that these elderly-type fecal metabolites suppressed the expression of genes related to tight junctions in normal colonic epithelial cells and induced the expression of inflammatory cytokines in colon cancer cells. These findings suggest that metabolites produced by the aged gut microbiota could contribute to intestinal and systemic homeostasis and could be targeted for preventing aging-associated diseases.","2021","2021 Jan-Dec","Shin Yoshimoto; Eri Mitsuyama; Keisuke Yoshida; Toshitaka Odamaki; Jin-Zhong Xiao","Next Generation Science Institute, Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd ., Kanagawa, Japan.; Next Generation Science Institute, Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd ., Kanagawa, Japan.; Next Generation Science Institute, Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd ., Kanagawa, Japan.; Next Generation Science Institute, Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd ., Kanagawa, Japan.; Next Generation Science Institute, Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd ., Kanagawa, Japan."

In many cancers, increased infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells associates with good prognosis. Although the mechanisms that enable NK cells to restrain colorectal cancer (CRC) are unclear, the current study suggests the involvement of Smad4. We found suppressed Smad4 expression in circulating NK cells of untreated metastatic CRC patients. Moreover, NK cell-specific Smad4 deletion promoted colon adenomas in DSS-treated ApcMin/+ mice and adenocarcinomas in AOM/DSS-treated mice. Other studies have shown that Smad4 loss or weak expression in colonic epithelium associates with poor survival in CRC patients. Therefore, targeting Smad4 in both colonic epithelium and NK cells could provide an excellent opportunity to manage CRC. Toward this end, we showed that dietary intervention with black raspberries (BRBs) increased Smad4 expression in colonic epithelium in patients with FAP or CRC and in the two CRC mouse models. Also, benzoate metabolites of BRBs, such as hippurate, upregulated Smad4 and Gzmb expression that might enhance the cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells. Of note, increased levels of hippurate is a metabolomic marker of a healthy gut microbiota in humans, and hippurate also has antitumor effects. In conclusion, our study suggests a new mechanism for the action of benzoate metabolites derived from plant-based foods. This mechanism could be exploited clinically to upregulate Smad4 in colonic epithelium and NK cells, thereby delaying CRC progression.","2020","2020","Yi-Wen Huang; Chien-Wei Lin; Pan Pan; Tianjiao Shan; Carla Elena Echeveste; Yue Yang Mo; Hsin-Tzu Wang; Mohammed Aldakkak; Susan Tsai; Kiyoko Oshima; Martha Yearsley; Jianbo Xiao; Hui Cao; Chongde Sun; Ming Du; Weibin Bai; Jianhua Yu; Li-Shu Wang","Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States.; Division of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States.; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States.; Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States.; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States.; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States.; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States.; Department of Surgery, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States.; Department of Surgery, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States.; Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.; Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, University of Macau, Macau, Macau.; Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, University of Macau, Macau, Macau.; Laboratory of Fruit Quality Biology/Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Integrative Biology/The State Agriculture Ministry Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Growth, Development and Quality Improvement, Zhejiang University, Zijingang Campus, Hangzhou, China.; School of Food Science and Technology, National Engineering Research Center of Seafood, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian, China.; Department of Food Science and Engineering, Institute of Food Safety and Nutrition, Guangdong Engineering Technology Center of Food Safety Molecular Rapid Detection, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Comprehensive Cancer Center, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States."

Human studies support that dietary navy bean intake modulates metabolism by the gut microbiome. This study investigated the effect of navy bean ingestion on plasma and urine metabolite profiles of overweight and obese colorectal cancer survivors. Twenty participants completed a single-blinded, randomized-controlled dietary intervention with precooked navy beans (35 g bean powder/day) or control (0 g/day) for 4 weeks. Plasma and urine were collected at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks following consumption. Nontargeted metabolomics was applied to study meals and snacks, navy beans, plasma, and urine. Increased navy bean consumption was hypothesized to (i) delineate dietary biomarkers and (ii) promote metabolic shifts relevant for cancer protection in the plasma and urine metabolome. At 4 weeks, 16 plasma and 16 urine metabolites were significantly different in the navy bean intervention group compared with placebo control (P < 0.05). Increased plasma 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (1.34-fold), S-methylcysteine (1.92-fold), and pipecolate (3.89-fold), and urine S-adenosylhomocysteine (2.09-fold) and cysteine (1.60-fold) represent metabolites with cancer-protective actions following navy bean consumption. Diet-derived metabolites were detected in plasma or urine and confirmed for presence in the navy bean intervention meals and snacks. These included 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, betaine, pipecolate, S-methylcysteine, choline, eicosapentaenoate (20:5n3), benzoate, S-adenosylhomocysteine, N-delta-acetylornithine, cysteine, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate, gentisate, hippurate, 4-hydroxyhippurate, and salicylate. The navy bean dietary intervention for 4 weeks showed changes to pathways of metabolic importance to colorectal cancer prevention and merit continued attention for dietary modulation in future high-risk cohort investigations.

Further, the metabolic alterations mediating the effects of adiposity on CRC are not fully understood. We examined sex- and site-specific associations of adiposity with CRC risk and whether adiposity-associated metabolites explain the associations of adiposity with CRC. Genetic variants from genome-wide association studies of body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR, unadjusted for BMI; N = 806,810), and 123 metabolites from targeted nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics (N = 24,925), were used as instruments. Sex-combined and sex-specific Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted for BMI and WHR with CRC risk (58,221 cases and 67,694 controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium, Colorectal Cancer Transdisciplinary Study, and Colon Cancer Family Registry). Sex-combined MR was conducted for BMI and WHR with metabolites, for metabolites with CRC, and for BMI and WHR with CRC adjusted for metabolite classes in multivariable models. In sex-specific MR analyses, higher BMI (per 4.2 kg/m2) was associated with 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08, 1.38) times higher CRC odds among men (inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) model); among women, higher BMI (per 5.2 kg/m2) was associated with 1.09 (95% CI = 0.97, 1.22) times higher CRC odds. WHR (per 0.07 higher) was more strongly associated with CRC risk among women (IVW OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.08, 1.43) than men (IVW OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.81, 1.36). BMI or WHR was associated with 104/123 metabolites at false discovery rate-corrected P ≤ 0.05; several metabolites were associated with CRC, but not in directions that were consistent with the mediation of positive adiposity-CRC relations. In multivariable MR analyses, associations of BMI and WHR with CRC were not attenuated following adjustment for representative metabolite classes, e.g., the univariable IVW OR for BMI with CRC was 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00, 1.26), and this became 1.11 (95% CI = 0.99, 1.26) when adjusting for cholesterol in low-density lipoprotein particles. Our results suggest that higher BMI more greatly raises CRC risk among men, whereas higher WHR more greatly raises CRC risk among women. Adiposity was associated with numerous metabolic alterations, but none of these explained associations between adiposity and CRC. More detailed metabolomic measures are likely needed to clarify the mechanistic pathways.","2020","2020 Dec 17","Caroline J Bull; Joshua A Bell; Neil Murphy; Eleanor Sanderson; George Davey Smith; Nicholas J Timpson;

Multiple differentially expressed metabolic genes have been identified in colon cancer (CC), and their biological functions and prognostic values have been well explored. The purpose of the present study was to establish a metabolic signature to optimize the prognostic prediction in CC. The related data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) combined with GSE39582 set, GSE17538 set, GSE33113 set, and GSE37892 set. The differentially expressed metabolic genes were selected for univariate Cox regression and lasso Cox regression analysis using TCGA and GTEx datasets. Finally, a seventeen-gene metabolic signature was developed to divide patients into a high-risk group and a low-risk group. Patients in the high-risk group presented poorer prognosis compared to the low-risk group in both TCGA and GEO datasets. Moreover, gene set enrichment analyses demonstrated multiple significantly enriched metabolism-related pathways. To sum up, our study described a novel seventeen-gene metabolic signature for prognostic prediction of colon cancer.","2020","2020","Dakui Luo; Zezhi Shan; Qi Liu; Sanjun Cai; Qingguo Li; Xinxiang Li","Department of Colorectal Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai 200032, China.; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.; Department of Colorectal Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai 200032, China.; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.; Department of Colorectal Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai 200032, China.; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.; Department of Colorectal Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai 200032, China.; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.; Department of Colorectal Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai 200032, China.; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.; Department of Colorectal Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai 200032, China.; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."

Shikonin, a naphthoquinone compound extracted from the root of Lithospermum erythrorhizon, is extensively reported to exert antitumor activity against various types of cancer. However, the systematic effect of shikonin in colon cancer remains poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated the antitumor activity of shikonin in human colon cancer cells and the therapeutic effect on a xenograft mouse model. Transcriptomics and metabolomics were further integrated to provide a systematic perspective of the shikonin-induced antitumor mechanism. The results demonstrated that shikonin had a remarkable antitumor potency both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, metabolic pathways, including the purine metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism, were perturbed and subsequently led to cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. In particular, the disturbance of purine metabolism may account for the major mechanism resulting from shikonin antitumor activity.","2020","2020","Yang Chen; Yun Gao; Xiaojiao Yi; Jinghui Zhang; Zhongjian Chen; Yongjiang Wu","College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Institute of Cancer and Basic Medicine (ICBM), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, China.; Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, China.; Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, China.; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Institute of Cancer and Basic Medicine (ICBM), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, China.; Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, China.; Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, China.; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."

Here, we identified an ileal immune profile associated with the prognosis of colon cancer and responses to chemotherapy. The whole immune ileal transcriptome was upregulated in poor-prognosis patients with proximal colon cancer, while the colonic immunity of healthy and neoplastic areas was downregulated (except for the Th17 fingerprint) in such patients. Similar observations were made across experimental models of implanted and spontaneous murine colon cancer, showing a relationship between carcinogenesis and ileal inflammation. Conversely, oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy could restore a favorable, attenuated ileal immune fingerprint in responders. These results suggest that chemotherapy inversely shapes the immune profile of the ileum-tumor axis, influencing clinical outcome.","2021","2021 May","Marion Picard; Satoru Yonekura; Karolina Slowicka;

To explore these changes, EVs from prostate, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), colon cancer cell lines, and control EVs from their noncancerous counterparts were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation and analyzed by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), electron microscopy (EM), Western blotting, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Although minor differences between the cancerous and non-cancerous cell-derived EVs were observed by NTA and Western blotting, the largest differences were detected in their metabolite cargo. Compared to EVs from noncancerous cells, cancer EVs contained elevated levels of soluble metabolites, e.g., amino acids and B vitamins. Two metabolites, proline and succinate, were elevated in the EV samples of all three cancer types. In addition, folate and creatinine were elevated in the EVs from prostate and CTCL cancer cell lines. In conclusion, we present the first evidence in vitro that the altered metabolism of different cancer cells is reflected in common metabolite changes in their EVs.

In this study, we firstly have characterized the glycoengineered cell line SW620 transfected with the fucosyltransferase 6 (FUT6) coding for the α1,3-fucosyltransferase 6 (FUT6), which is the main enzyme responsible for the synthesis of sLeX in CRC. The SW620FUT6 cell line expressed high levels of sLeX antigen and E-selectin ligands. Moreover, it displayed increased migration ability. E-selectin ligand glycoproteins were isolated from the SW620FUT6 cell line, identified by mass spectrometry, and validated by flow cytometry and Western blot (WB). The most prominent E-selectin ligand we identified was the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM).

Astragalus membranaceus-Curcuma wenyujin (AC) was a classic drug pair that has a good clinical effect on gastrointestinal inflammation and many tumors. Our previous research proved that AC can inhibit tumor growth and metastasis especially the colorectal cancer (CRC), also promote the normalization of tumor blood vessels, but its optimal ratio and the specific mechanism is still not clear. In this study, colon cancer mice of orthotopic transplantion model was used to screen the best proportion, UPLC-Q-TOF/MS metabolomics analysis method was established to explore the pathogenesis of colon cancer and the molecular mechanism of AC. The correlation analysis of metabolite changes and tumor growth was analyzed by R language. The result showed that AC at the ratio of 2:1 showed the best effect on inhibiting tumor growth, also the liver and spleen metastasis rate. A total of 23 potential biomarkers were detected in the serum of colon cancer mice by the analysis of Progenesis QI (Version 2.4) software. Among this, 11 metabolites including purines, steroids, phytosphingosine and l-palmitoylcarnitine were up-regulated in CC mice, while 12 metabolites like amino acids, deoxyribose and dihydrobiopterin were down-regulated in CC mice. After the treatment of AC for 15 days, 8 biomarkers were up-regulated, and 9 biomarkers down-regulated. Especially, AC at the ratio of 2:1 showed a significant callback effect on metabolic biomarkers, such as hypoxanthine, xanthosine, 7-methylxanthine, all-trans-retinoic acid, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid. 8 metabolic pathways: Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, Valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, Phenylalanine metabolism, Caffeine metabolism, Retinol metabolism, Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism were selected as the model group disturbed metabolic pathways after the enrichment of MetaboAnalyst 4.0 online analysis software. And compared with the model group, Valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, Caffeine metabolism pathway and Retinol metabolism pathways were altered after the intervention of AC. The correlation analysis results showed that various endogenous metabolites in serum have a strong correlation with tumor weight, such as hypoxanthine, which provides a basis for the selection of clinical markers. The results showed that AC can partially regulate metabolic disorder of CC mice by reversing the changes of metabolites, so as to inhibit the growth and metastasis of colon cancer, especially at the ratio of 2:1. These findings can provide a scientific basis for exploring the diagnostic biomarkers of colon cancer, and for clinical application of AC in the treatment of CRC program.","2021","2021 Jan 30","Ruolan Sun; Junfei Gu; Xiangwei Chang; Fuyan Liu; Yan Liang; Xinyue Yang; Li Liang; Decai Tang","School of Traditional Chinese Medicine and School of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing Jiangsu 210046, China.; School of Traditional Chinese Medicine and School of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing Jiangsu 210046, China.

In contrast, metabolic changes in tumor tissues were very significant in the PP242-treated group compared to the xenograft control (XC) group, and revealed that energy and lipid metabolism were mainly altered by PP242 treatment like other cancer inhibitors. Additionally, in this study, it was discovered that not only TCA cycle but also fatty acid β-oxidation (β-FAO) for energy metabolism was inhibited and clear reduction in glycerophospholipid was observed. This study reveals new insights into the underlying anticancer mechanism of the dual mTOR inhibitor PP242, and could help further to facilitate the understanding of PP242 effects in the clinical application.","2020","2020 Oct 16","Md Mamunur Rashid; Hyunbeom Lee; Byung Hwa Jung","Molecular Recognition Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, 02792, South Korea.; Division of Bio-Medical Science and Technology, KIST School, Korea University of Science and Technology (UST), Seoul, 02792, South Korea.; Molecular Recognition Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, 02792, South Korea.; Molecular Recognition Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, 02792, South Korea. jbhluck@kist.re.kr.; Division of Bio-Medical Science and Technology, KIST School, Korea University of Science and Technology (UST), Seoul, 02792, South Korea. jbhluck@kist.re.kr."

The development of effective anti-cancer treatments targeting metabolism may be facilitated by the identification and rational combinatorial targeting of metabolic pathways. We performed mass spectrometric metabolomics analysis in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the efficacy of drugs and identify metabolic connectivity. We show that K-Ras-mutant lung and colon cancer cells exhibit a distinct metabolic rewiring, the latter being more dependent on respiration. Combined treatment with the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 and the PI3K/aldolase inhibitor NVP-BKM120 more consistently reduces cell growth of tumor xenografts. Maximal growth inhibition correlates with the disruption of redox homeostasis, involving loss of reduced glutathione regeneration, redox cofactors, and a decreased connectivity among metabolites primarily involved in nucleic acid metabolism. Our findings open the way to develop metabolic connectivity profiling as a tool for a selective strategy of combined drug repositioning in precision oncology.","2020","2020","Daniela Gaglio; Marcella Bonanomi; Silvia Valtorta; Rohit Bharat; Marilena Ripamonti; Federica Conte; Giulia Fiscon; Nicole Righi; Elisabetta Napodano; Federico Papa; Isabella Raccagni; Seth J Parker; Ingrid Cifola; Tania Camboni; Paola Paci; Anna Maria Colangelo; Marco Vanoni; Christian M Metallo; Rosa Maria Moresco; Lilia Alberghina","Institute of Molecular Bioimaging and Physiology (IBFM), National Research Council (CNR), Segrate, MI Italy.; ISBE.

Despite progress in surgery and therapy options, CRC is still a considerable cause of cancer mortality worldwide. In this study, a colon cancer patient-derived xenograft model was established to evaluate the antitumor activity of Shikonin. The protective effect underlying Shikonin was determined through assessing serum levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and kidney functions (BuN, Scr) in PDX mice. Proteomics and metabolomics profiles were integrated to provide a systematic perspective in dynamic changes of proteins and global endogenous metabolites as well as their perturbed pathways. A total of 456 differently expressed proteins (DEPs), 32 differently expressed metabolites (DEMs) in tumor tissue, and 20 DEMs in mice serum were identified. The perturbation of arginine biosynthesis, purine metabolism, and biosynthesis of amino acids may mainly account for therapeutic mechanism of Shikonin. Furthermore, the expression of mRNAs participating in arginine biosynthesis (CPS1, OTC, Arg1) and do novo purine synthesis (GART, PAICS, ATIC) were validated through RT-qPCR. Our study provides new insights into the drug therapeutic strategies and a better understanding of antitumor mechanisms that might be valuable for further studies on Shikonin in the clinical treatment of colorectal cancer.","2020","2020 Aug 24","Yang Chen; Juan Ni; Yun Gao; Jinghui Zhang; Xuesong Liu; Yong Chen; Zhongjian Chen; Yongjiang Wu","College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.; Institute of Cancer and Basic Medicine (ICBM), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, 310022, China.; Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, 310022, China.; Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, 310022, China.; Institute of Cancer and Basic Medicine (ICBM), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, 310022, China.; Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, 310022, China.; Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, 310022, China.; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.; Institute of Cancer and Basic Medicine (ICBM), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, 310022, China. chenzj@zjcc.org.cn.; Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, 310022, China. chenzj@zjcc.org.cn.; Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, 310022, China. chenzj@zjcc.org.cn.; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China. yjwu@zju.edu.cn."

Apoptosis can occur via a death receptor-dependent extrinsic or a mitochondrial-dependent intrinsic pathway and can be induced by various chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, the anticancer activity of Saussurea costus and its mode of intervention in human cancer cells of breast, colon, and liver were investigated. In this study, the bioactives of S. costus leaves were extensively extracted in five solvents of different polarity. The cytotoxicity and anticancer effect of the extracted secondary metabolites were investigated against breast (MCF-7), liver (HepG2), and colon (HCT116) cancer cell lines using a Sulphorhodamine B (SRB) assay. Secondary metabolites extracted using hexane, methanol, ethyl acetate, and chloroform had the highest cytotoxicity and thus the greatest anticancer effect on all the cancer cell lines tested (IC50; ranging from 0.25 to 2.5 μg/ml), while butanol was comparatively less active (IC50; ranging from 23.2 to 25.5 μg/ml). Further investigation using DNA flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy revealed that the extract arrested the cells in the G1 phase of cell cycle and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the elevated expression level of proapoptotic proteins and decreased expression level of antiapoptotic proteins confirmed that the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway was involved in mediating the apoptosis of cancer cells upon treatment with S. costus extract. These results altogether suggest that S. costus could be a potential anticancer agent. These results suggest that the S. costus extract is the potential source of the secondary metabolites that could be used as anticancer agent to treat diverse cancers of breast, colon, and liver.","2020","2020","Ali A Shati; Mohammed A Alkahtani; Mohamed Y Alfaifi; Serag Eldin I Elbehairi; Fahmy G Elsaid; Rajagopalan Prasanna; Mushtaq A Mir","Biology Department, Faculty of Science, King Khalid University, Abha 9004, Saudi Arabia.; Biology Department, Faculty of Science, King Khalid University, Abha 9004, Saudi Arabia.; Biology Department, Faculty of Science, King Khalid University, Abha 9004, Saudi Arabia.; Biology Department, Faculty of Science, King Khalid University, Abha 9004, Saudi Arabia.; Cell Culture Lab, Egyptian Organization for Biological Products and Vaccines (VACSERA Holding Company), 51 Wezaret El-Zeraa St., Agouza, Giza 12311, Egypt.; Biology Department, Faculty of Science, King Khalid University, Abha 9004, Saudi Arabia.; Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.; Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Khalid University, P.

Warb. (Myristicaceae), popularly known in Brazil as ""mucuíba"", ""ucuúba"", ""ucuúba-branca"" or ""ucuúba do igapó"", is a medicinal plant used to treat a variety of diseases, including infections, inflammatory processes and cancer. In the present work, we investigated the chemical constituents and the in vitro and in vivo inhibition of human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells by essential oils obtained from the bark (EOB) and leaves (EOL) of V. surinamensis. EOB and EOL were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed via gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. In vitro cytotoxic activity was determined in cultured cancer cells HCT116, HepG2, HL-60, B16-F10 and MCF-7 and in a non-cancerous cell line MRC-5 by the Alamar blue assay after 72 h of treatment. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining, mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cell cycle distribution were evaluated by flow cytometry in HCT116 cells treated with essential oils after 24 and 48 h of treatment. The cells were also stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa to analyze cell morphology. In vivo antitumor activity was evaluated in C.B-17 SCID mice with HCT116 cells. The main constituents in EOB were aristolene (28.0 ± 3.1%), α-gurjunene (15.1 ± 2.4%), valencene (14.1 ± 1.9%), germacrene D (7.5 ± 0.9%), δ-guaiene (6.8 ± 1.0%) and β-elemene (5.4 ± 0.6%). On the other hand, EOL displayed α-farnesene (14.5 ± 1.5%), β-elemene (9.6 ± 2.3%), bicyclogermacrene (8.1 ± 2.0%), germacrene D (7.4 ± 0.7%) and α-cubebene (5.6 ± 1.1%) as main constituents. EOB showed IC50 values for cancer cells ranging from 9.41 to 29.52 μg/mL for HCT116 and B16-F10, while EOL showed IC50 values for cancer cells ranging from 7.07 to 26.70 μg/mL for HepG2 and HCT116, respectively. The IC50 value for a non-cancerous MRC-5 cell was 34.7 and 38.93 μg/mL for EOB and EOL, respectively. Both oils induced apoptotic-like cell death in HCT116 cells, as observed by the morphological characteristics of apoptosis, externalization of phosphatidylserine, mitochondrial depolarization and fragmentation of internucleosomal DNA. At a dose of 40 mg/kg, tumor mass inhibition rates were 57.9 and 44.8% in animals treated with EOB and EOL, respectively.

HILIC and RPLC are respectively performed on two ultra-high performance LC (UHPLC) systems, and coupled to one mass spectrometer to acquire the data. When HILIC gradient elution is running RPLC is in a washing and equilibration state, and vice versa. As a result, the total analysis time was reduced by about one third to 25.4 min. Two hundred and eight representative standards including at least twelve types of commonly met metabolites, SRM 1950 plasma, serum, urine and liver tissue samples were used to test the established alternate HILIC/RPLC-MS method. The results demonstrated that the method possessed high metabolite coverage. The developed method was validated to have good linearity and repeatability.

Systematic ganglioside profiling is challenging because of their naturally low abundance and highly diverse species. Herein, a new data-independent acquisition and parallel reaction monitoring (DIA/PRM) method with superior sensitivity was developed. The untargeted DIA acquisition consecutively records all the precursor ion and fragment ions at the same time, while the targeted PRM analysis with versatile higher collisional dissociation generates full MS/MS spectra for structure elucidation and verification. As compared with traditional data-dependent acquisition (DDA), the DIA/PRM method unbiasedly detected the majority of abundant ganglioside species and as low as 50 pg of ganglioside in an untargeted manner. Gangliosides in four kinds of biological samples including the mouse brain, mouse plasma, HeLa cell, and human colon cancer tissue were systematically identified, and low-abundance ganglioside species were further extended on the basis of linear chromatography retention rules of the most frequently detected ganglioside species. A total of 383 ganglioside features were defined with 329 of them derived from 32 ganglioside species. Taking advantage of the high-resolution MS analysis, rare ganglioside species were further elucidated according to their characteristic fragment ions and neutral losses. In total, 18 gangliosides with a ceramide carbon number from 20 to 25 and modified gangliosides, including 18 acetylated, 8 diacetylated, 1 phosphorylated, 36 N-glycolyneuraminic acid (NeuGc)-containing, and 7 di-NeuGc-containing gangliosides, were newly identified. The developed DIA/PRM method therefore generated a rich ganglioside resource for further functional exploration and is a unique alternative for DDA analysis for global ganglioside profiling in various biological systems.","2020","2020 Aug 04","Hua Li; Ruilian Xu; Lijun Yang; Hemi Luan; Shili Chen; Lan Chen; Zongwei Cai; Ruijun Tian","SUSTech Core Research Facilities, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China.; State Key Laboratory of Environmental and Biological Analysis, Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of SUSTech and Shenzhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen 518020, China.; Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of SUSTech and Shenzhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen 518020, China.; Department of Chemistry, College of Science, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China.; SUSTech Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China.; Department of General Surgery and Shanghai Key Laboratory of Biliary Tract Disease Research, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200092, China.; Department of Chemistry, College of Science, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China.; State Key Laboratory of Environmental and Biological Analysis, Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Chemistry, College of Science, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China."

Based on this finding, here, we quantify the quality of a given normalization method according to how well a GGM inferred from the respective normalized data reconstructs known synthesis reactions in the glycosylation pathway. The method therefore exploits a biological measure of goodness. We analyzed 23 different normalization combinations applied to six large-scale glycomics cohorts across three experimental platforms: Liquid Chromatography - ElectroSpray Ionization - Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS), Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection (UHPLC-FLD), and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Furier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance - Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-FTICR-MS). Based on our results, we recommend normalizing glycan data using the 'Probabilistic Quotient' method followed by log-transformation, irrespective of the measurement platform. This recommendation is further supported by an additional analysis, where we ranked normalization methods based on their statistical associations with age, a factor known to associate with glycomics measurements.","2020","2020 Jul 02","Elisa Benedetti; Nathalie Gerstner; Maja Pučić-Baković; Toma Keser; Karli R Reiding; L Renee Ruhaak; Tamara Štambuk; Maurice H J Selman; Igor Rudan; Ozren Polašek; Caroline Hayward; Marian Beekman; Eline Slagboom; Manfred Wuhrer; Malcolm G Dunlop; Gordan Lauc; Jan Krumsiek","Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10022, USA.; Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum München-German Research Center for Environmental Health, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany.; Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum München-German Research Center for Environmental Health, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany.; Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry, 80804 Munich, Germany.; Genos Glycoscience Research Laboratory, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.; Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.; Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research and Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Utrecht, 3584 CH Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZC Leiden, The Netherlands.; Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZC Leiden, The Netherlands.; Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZC Leiden, The Netherlands.; Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.; Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research and Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Utrecht, 3584 CH Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics, University of Edinburgh, EH8 9AG Edinburgh, UK.; Medical School, University of Split, 21000 Split, Croatia.; Gen-info Ltd., 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.; Medical Research Council Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, UK.; Section of Molecular Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZC Leiden, The Netherlands.; Section of Molecular Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZC Leiden, The Netherlands.; Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZC Leiden, The Netherlands.; Colon Cancer Genetics Group, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh and Medical Research Council Human Genetics Unit, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, UK.; Genos Glycoscience Research Laboratory, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.; Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.; Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10022, USA.; Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum München-German Research Center for Environmental Health, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany."

Despite recent studies identifying CRC molecular subtypes, a metabolite classification system is still lacking. We aimed to explore the distinct phenotypes and subtypes of CRC at the metabolite level. Methods: We conducted an untargeted metabolomics analysis of 51 paired tumor tissues and adjacent mucosa using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Multivariate analysis including principal component analysis, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis and heat maps, univariate analysis, and pathway analysis were used to identify potential metabolite phenotypes of CRC. Unsupervised consensus clustering was used to identify robust metabolite subtypes, and evaluated their clinical relevance. Results: A total of 173 metabolites (including nucleotides, carbohydrates, free fatty acids, and choline) were identified between CRC tumor tissue and adjacent mucosa. We found that lipid metabolism was closely related to the occurrence and progression of CRC. In particular, CRC tissues could be divided into three subtypes, and statistically significant correlations between different subtypes and clinical prognosis were observed. Conclusions: CRC tumor tissue exhibits distinct metabolite phenotypes. Metabolite differences between subtypes may provide a basis and direction for further clinical individualized treatment planning.","2020","2020","Zhiping Long; Junde Zhou; Kun Xie; Zhen Wu; Huihui Yin; Volontovich Daria; Jingshen Tian; Nannan Zhang; Liangliang Li; Yashuang Zhao; Fan Wang; Maoqing Wang; Yunfu Cui","Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.; Department of Colorectal Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.; Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China."

This expression indicates the crucial role FOXP3 takes up as the disease progresses. However, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastasis is still mostly unknown. This study set out to explore the molecular characteristics of FOXP3 in driving the liver metastasis within CRC. We downloaded the RNA-seq data from the GSE50760. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)WGCNA and RNA-Seq analysis were applied to find the key gene network associated with colorectal cancer liver metastasis. Then we performed pathway enrichment analysis on liver metastasis-associated gene set. Immunohistochemistry, in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to test expression and function of FOXP3 in CRC tissues and liver metastasis tissues. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis was performed to identify the alteration of FOXP3 expression in metabolites of colorectal cancer liver metastasis. Western blot was performed to confirm changes of matrix metalloproteinase 9MMP9 expression were downstream events of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM). We found that FOXP3 and MMP9 exhibited co-expression relationships and affected liver metastasis in CRC. Upregulation of FOXP3 promotes cell migration and invasion in CRC, which suggests a pro-cancer effect. Moreover, metabolomics analysis showed that knockdown of FOXP3 significantly reduced SAM levels, and changes of MMP9 expression were downstream events of SAM, which is concentration-dependent. Besides, The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Western blot analysis confirmed that overexpression of FOXP3 activates the Wnt pathway to promote colon cancer metastasis. Our results altogether suggested that FOXP3 expression inhibited the SAM cycle to reduce SAMe levels, resulting in altered MMP9 expression and helped CRC liver metastasis.","2020","2020 May","Zhe Wang; Jingdong Zhang","Medical Oncology Department of Gastrointestinal Cancer, Liaoning Cancer Hospital & Institute, Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110042, China.; Medical Oncology Department of Gastrointestinal Cancer, Liaoning Cancer Hospital & Institute, Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110042, China."

However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. We investigated the effects of EGCG on activities of CRC cells and the exact molecular mechanism. We used human colon cancer cells (HT-29) and exposed them to EGCG at various concentrations. The MTT assay, flow cytometry, and TUNEL staining were used to study the underlying mechanisms of EGCG (proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy). Western blotting was used to measure expression of marker proteins of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy. Using a combined microarray-based transcriptomic and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS)-based metabolomic approach, we investigated the perturbed pathways induced by EGCG treatment at transcript and metabolite levels. Transcriptomic analyses showed that 486 genes were differentially expressed between untreated and EGCG-treated cells. Also, 88 differentially expressed metabolites were identified between untreated and EGCG-treated cells. The altered metabolites were involved in the metabolism of glutathione, glycerophospholipids, starch, sucrose, amino sugars, and nucleotide sugars. There was substantial agreement between the results of transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses. Our data indicate that the anticancer activity of EGCG against HT-29 cells is mediated by induction of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy. EGCG modulates cancer-cell metabolic pathways. These results provide a platform for future molecular mechanistic studies of EGCG.","2020","2020 Aug 15","Zheyu Zhang; Sifang Zhang; Jingjing Yang; Pengji Yi; Panpan Xu; Min Yi; Weijun Peng","Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese &Western Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China; Department of Gastroenterology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, China; Department of Gastroenterology, Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, Guangxi 541001, China.; Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese &Western Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.; Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, China.; Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese &Western Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.; Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese &Western Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.; Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese &Western Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.

It remains unclear whether gut microbes contribute to the elicitation of TFH cell-driven responses. Here, we show that the ileal microbiota dictates tolerogenic versus immunogenic cell death of ileal intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and the accumulation of TFH cells in patients with CC and mice. Suppression of IEC apoptosis led to compromised chemotherapy-induced immunosurveillance against CC in mice. Protective immune responses against CC were associated with residence of Bacteroides fragilis and Erysipelotrichaceae in the ileum. In the presence of these commensals, apoptotic ileal IECs elicited PD-1+ TFH cells in an interleukin-1R1- and interleukin-12-dependent manner. The ileal microbiome governed the efficacy of chemotherapy and PD-1 blockade in CC independently of microsatellite instability. These findings demonstrate that immunogenic ileal apoptosis contributes to the prognosis of chemotherapy-treated CC.","2020","2020 Jun","Maria Paula Roberti; Satoru Yonekura; Connie P M Duong; Marion Picard;

The natural flavonoid Quercetin (Que) has been reported to be able to inhibit P-gp-mediated MDR in various cancer cells. However, the MDR reversal effect of Que on human colon cancer cells and its mechanism at the metabolic level requires further clarification. This study was designed to provide a better understanding of the MDR reversal effect of Que. Our present results showed that 33 μM of Que significantly improved the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin (Dox) to P-gp-overexpressed SW620/Ad300 cells by proliferation and apoptpsis assay. Further mechanism studies demonstrated that Que inhibited the ATP-driven transport activity of P-gp, which in turn increased the intracellular accumulation of Dox. The metabolomics studies based on UPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed that Que could reverse the MDR by significantly blocking D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, and the underlying mechanism is that Que down-regulated the expression of the glutamine transporter solute sarrier family 1, member 5 (SLC1A5) in SW620/Ad300 cells. This is the first time to report that Que was a SLC1A5 inhibitor, which could be served as a template compound to potentially develop novel P-gp-mediated MDR reversal modulators in cancer chemotherapy.","2020","2020 Aug 15","Yuanyuan Zhou; Junhong Zhang; Kaili Wang; Wenchao Han; Xinying Wang; Ming Gao; Zihan Wang; Yaxin Sun; Hao Yan; Hang Zhang; Xia Xu; Dong-Hua Yang","Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R&D and Preclinical Safety, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450001, China.

The aim of the present study was to identify and evaluate serum metabolites as biomarkers for the detection of tumor lymph node metastasis and the prediction of patient survival. The present study analyzed the metabolites in the serum of patients with advanced colon cancer both with and without lymph node metastasis. Blood samples from 104 patients with stage T3 colon cancer were collected and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The metabolites were structurally confirmed with data from the Human Metabolome Database. The association between the serum metabolites and the clinicopathological characteristics and survival time of patients from the present study was analyzed. Overall, 227 different metabolites were identified in the serum of patients with stage T3 colon cancer with or without lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, 17 of these metabolites may potentially distinguish those patients with lymph node metastasis from those patients without. In addition, five factors, including abscisic acid, calcitroic acid and glucosylsphingosine presence in the serum, age and sex, were identified as independent predictors for lymph node metastasis (P<0.05). Furthermore, three factors, including abscisic acid, calcitroic acid and glucosylsphingosine presence in the serum were independent predictors for patient survival (P<0.05). In conclusion, the serum levels of abscisic acid, calcitroic-acid and glucosylsphingosine may be considered as potential biomarkers to predict the occurrence of lymph node metastasis and the survival time of patients with colon cancer.","2020","2020 Jun","Yang Zhang; Yechao Du; Zheyu Song; Suoning Liu; Wei Li; Daguang Wang; Jian Suo","The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130021, P.R.

The aim of our study was to investigate the beneficial effect of Bifidobacterium bifidum CGMCC 15068 on an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis-associated CRC (CAC) mouse model. CAC was induced by an intra-peritoneal injection of AOM (10 mg/kg) and three 7-day cycles of 2% DSS in drinking water with a 14-day recovery period between two consecutive DSS administrations. B. bifidum CGMCC 15068 (3 × 109 CFU/mL) was gavaged once daily during the recovery period. Then, the faecal microbial composition and metabolome were profiled using the 16S rRNA sequencing technology and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. The administration of B. bifidum CGMCC 15068 attenuated tumourigenesis in the CAC mouse model. In addition, B. bifidum CGMCC 15068 pre-treatment increased the relative abundance of Akkermansia, Desulfovibrionaceae, Romboutsia, Turicibacter, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_013, Lachnospiraceae_UCG_004, and Lactobacillus. Meanwhile, B. bifidum CGMCC 15068 altered metabolites involved in the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), glycolysis, butyrate metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and galactose metabolism. Several significant correlations were identified between the differentially abundant microbes and metabolites. These findings supported the beneficial role of B. bifidum CGMCC 15068 in intestinal health by modulating dysbiosis and the gut metabolic profile. The manipulation of the gut microbial composition using probiotics might be a promising prevention strategy for CRC. Long-term and large-scale clinical trials are warranted for the potential clinical applications of this strategy in the future.","2020","2020 Jul","Qing Wang; Kaicen Wang; Wenrui Wu; Longxian Lv; Xiaoyuan Bian;

Differential metabolites in the preoperative RC and CC samples and HVs were identified as potential biomarkers and evaluated for their utilities by receiver operating characteristic analyses. The different metabolic markers between CC and RC patients were identified, which may assist in distinguishing the two types of cancers. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.805 for combination of d-glucose and d-mannose for CC diagnosis, and 0.889 for combination of 2-aminobutanoic acid, 3-hydroxypyridine, d-glucose, d-mannose, isoleucine, l-tryptophan, urea, and uric acid for RC diagnosis. The combinations of metabolite markers showed a better predictability than CEA and CA199 two commonly used protein markers for CRC diagnosis in clinical practice. Combining the metabolite markers with these two protein markers effectively improved the diagnostic accuracy with the AUC reaching 0.936 and 0.937 for CC and RC diagnosis, respectively.

Fusobacterium nucleatum is the most commonly observed species in the colorectal tumor microenvironment and reportedly influences disease progression through numerous mechanisms. However, a detailed understanding of the role of this organism in cancer progression is limited, in part due to challenges in maintaining F. nucleatum viability under standard aerobic cell culture conditions. Herein we describe the development of a 3-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroid model that can harbor and promote the growth of anaerobic bacteria. Bacteria-tumor cell interactions and metabolic crosstalk were extensively studied by measuring the kinetics of bacterial growth, cell morphology and lysis, cancer-related gene expression, and metabolomics. We observed that viable F. nucleatum assembles biofilm-like structures in the tumor spheroid microenvironment, whereas heat-killed F. nucleatum is internalized and sequestered in the cancer cells. Lastly, we use the model to co-culture 28 Fusobacterium clinical isolates and demonstrate that the model successfully supports co-culture with diverse fusobacterial species. This bacteria-spheroid co-culture model enables mechanistic investigation of the role of anaerobic bacteria in the tumor microenvironment.","2020","2020 Mar 24","Stephen H Kasper; Carolina Morell-Perez; Thomas P Wyche; Theodore R Sana; Linda A Lieberman; Erik C Hett","Exploratory Science Center, Merck & Co., Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. stephen.kasper@merck.com.; Exploratory Science Center, Merck & Co., Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Exploratory Science Center, Merck & Co., Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Exploratory Science Center, Merck & Co., Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Exploratory Science Center, Merck & Co., Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Exploratory Science Center, Merck & Co., Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. erik.hett@merck.com."

Here, we show that active c-Src stimulates glycolysis by phosphorylating (Tyr194) and activating PFKFB3, a key enzyme that boosts glycolysis by producing fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and activating PFK1. Increased glycolysis intermediates replenish non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and serine pathway for biosynthesis of cancer cells. PFKFB3 knockout (KO) cells and their counterpart reconstituted with PFKFB3-Y194F show comparably impaired abilities for proliferation, migration, and xenograft formation. Furthermore, PFKFB3-Y194F knockin mice show impaired glycolysis and, mating of these mice with APCmin/+ mice attenuates spontaneous colon cancer formation in APCmin/+ mice. In summary, we identify a specific mechanism by which c-Src mediates glucose metabolism to meet cancer cells' requirements for maximal biosynthesis and proliferation. The PFKFB3-Tyr194 phosphorylation level highly correlates with c-Src activity in clinical tumor samples, indicating its potential as an evaluation for tumor prognosis.","2020","2020 Mar 24","Huanhuan Ma; Jia Zhang; Lin Zhou; Shixiong Wen; Hsiang-Yu Tang; Bin Jiang; Fengqiong Zhang; Muhammad Suleman; Dachao Sun; Ai Chen; Wentao Zhao; Furong Lin; Ming-Tong Tsau; Lu-Min Shih; Changchuan Xie; Xiaotong Li; Donghai Lin; Li-Man Hung; Mei-Ling Cheng; Qinxi Li","State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.; Metabolomics Core Laboratory, Healthy Aging Research Center, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City 33302, Taiwan.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.; Metabolomics Core Laboratory, Healthy Aging Research Center, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City 33302, Taiwan.; Metabolomics Core Laboratory, Healthy Aging Research Center, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City 33302, Taiwan.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.; Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361005, China.; Department and Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Tao-Yuan 33302, Taiwan; Center for Healthy and Aging Research, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City 33302, Taiwan; Kidney Research Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City 33302, Taiwan.

This is of concern as patients with RCC have the poorest clinical outcomes among all CRC patients. Aberrant metabolism is a known hallmark and therapeutic target for cancer. We propose that metabolic subphenotypes exist between CRCs due to intertumoral molecular and genomic variation, and differences in environmental milieu of the colon which vary between the sexes. Metabolomics analysis of patient colon tumors (n = 197) and normal tissues (n = 39) revealed sex-specific metabolic subphenotypes dependent on anatomic location. Tumors from women with RCC were nutrient-deplete, showing enhanced energy production to fuel asparagine synthesis and amino acid uptake. The clinical importance of our findings were further investigated in an independent data set from The Cancer Genomic Atlas, and demonstrated that high asparagine synthetase (ASNS) expression correlated with poorer survival for women. This is the first study to show a unique, nutrient-deplete metabolic subphenotype in women with RCC, with implications for tumor progression and outcomes in CRC patients.","2020","2020 Mar 17","Yuping Cai; Nicholas J W Rattray; Qian Zhang; Varvara Mironova; Alvaro Santos-Neto; Kuo-Shun Hsu; Zahra Rattray; Justin R Cross; Yawei Zhang; Philip B Paty; Sajid A Khan; Caroline H Johnson","Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.; Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.; Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK.; Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Surgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. sajid.khan@yale.edu.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA. caroline.johnson@yale.edu."

The bioactive extract was shown to arrest HT-29 cells in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, which might be mediated by the inactivation of the FAT10 cancer signalling pathway among other genes identified as altered in the transcriptomic analysis. In addition, cellular redox homeostasis, as well as the polyamines pathway and methionine metabolism were found to be affected as suggested from the metabolomics data. Finally, the Foodomics integration enabled the identification of genes, such as MAD2L1, involved in the polyamine and glutathione metabolism, or the inactivation of the NUPR1 transcription factor, that might be related with the alteration of the intracellular ceramide levels in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress.","2020","2020 Apr","Diego Ballesteros-Vivas; Gerardo Alvarez-Rivera; Carlos León; Sandra Johanna Morantes; Elena Ibánez; Fabián Parada-Alfonso; Alejandro Cifuentes; Alberto Valdés","Laboratory of Foodomics, Institute of Food Science Research, CIAL, CSIC, Nicolás Cabrera 9, 28049 Madrid, Spain; High Pressure Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Carrera 30 #45-03, Bogotá D.C. 111321, Colombia.; Laboratory of Foodomics, Institute of Food Science Research, CIAL, CSIC, Nicolás Cabrera 9, 28049 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Bioengineering, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Leganés, Madrid, Spain.; Unit of Basic Oral Investigation (UIBO), School of Dentistry, Universidad El Bosque, Av.

Here, we used LC-MS/MS-based PL profiling of cell lines derived from normal colon mucosa, or isolated at distinct stages of CRC development, in order to study alterations of PL species potentially linked with cell transformation. We found that a detailed evaluation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylserine (PS) classes allowed us to cluster the studied epithelial cell lines according to their origin: i) cells originally derived from normal colon tissue (NCM460, FHC); ii) cell lines derived from colon adenoma or less advanced differentiating adenocarcinoma cells (AA/C1, HT-29); or, iii) cells obtained by in vitro transformation of adenoma cells and advanced colon adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-116, AA/C1/SB10, SW480, SW620). Although we tentatively identified several PS and PI species contributing to cell line clustering, full PI and PS profiles appeared to be a key to the successful cell line discrimination. In parallel, we compared PL composition of primary epithelial (EpCAM-positive) cells, isolated from tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues of colon cancer patients, with PL profiles of cell lines derived from normal colon mucosa (NCM460) and from colon adenocarcinoma (HCT-116, SW480) cells, respectively. In general, higher total levels of all PL classes were observed in tumor cells. The overall PL profiles of the cell lines, when compared with the respective patient-derived cells, exhibited similarities. Nevertheless, there were also some notable differences in levels of individual PL species. This indicated that epithelial cell lines, derived either from normal colon tissue or from CRC cells, could be employed as models for functional lipidomic analyses of colon cells, albeit with some caution. The biological significance of the observed PL deregulation, or their potential links with specific CRC stages, deserve further investigation.","2020","2020","Jiřina Hofmanová; Josef Slavík; Petra Ovesná; Zuzana Tylichová; Ladislav Dušek; Nicol Straková; Alena Hyršlová Vaculová; Miroslav Ciganek; Zdeněk Kala; Miroslav Jíra; Igor Penka; Jitka Kyclová; Zdeněk Kolář; Alois Kozubík; Miroslav Machala; Jan Vondráček","Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic.; Veterinary Research Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic.; Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic.; Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic.; Veterinary Research Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Surgery, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Anesthesiology, Resuscitation and Intensive Care, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Surgery, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Pathology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Clinical and Molecular Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacký University Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.; Veterinary Research Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic."

To examine right and left colon tissue metabolites according to body mass index that may serve as mechanistic targets for interventions and biomarkers for colon cancer risk. Global, non-targeted metabolomics was applied to assess right-ascending and left-descending colon tissue collected from healthy adults undergoing screening colonoscopies to test the hypothesis that BMI differentially impacts colon tissue metabolite profiles. The colon tissue and stool metabolome of healthy adults (n = 24) was analyzed for metabolite signatures and metabolic pathway networks implicated in progression of colorectal cancer. Ascending and descending colon contained 504 host, food, and microbiota-derived metabolites from normal weight, overweight and obese adults grouped according to body mass index. Amino acids, lipids, and nucleotides were among the chemical types that further differentiated from the stool metabolite profiles. Normal weight adults had 46 significantly different metabolites between ascending and descending colon tissue locations, whereas there were 37 metabolite differences in overweight and 28 metabolite differences for obese adults (P < 0.05). Obese adults had trimethylamine N-oxide, endocannabinoids and monoacylglycerols with different relative abundances identified between ascending and descending colon. Primary and secondary bile acids, vitamins, and fatty acids also showed marked relative abundance differences in colon tissue from overweight/obese adults. There were metabolite profile differences between right-ascending and left-descending colon tissue in healthy adults.

Although general mechanisms of thrombosis are enhanced in these patients, malignancy-specific triggers and their therapeutic implication remain poorly understood. Here we examined a colon cancer-specific VTE model and probed a set of metabolites with prothrombotic propensity in the inferior vena cava (IVC) ligation model. Athymic mice injected with human colon adenocarcinoma cells exhibited significantly higher IVC clot weights, a biological readout of venous thrombogenicity, compared with the control mice. Targeted metabolomics analysis of plasma of mice revealed an increase in the blood levels of kynurenine and indoxyl sulfate (tryptophan metabolites) in xenograft-bearing mice, which correlated positively with the increase in the IVC clot size. These metabolites are ligands of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling. Accordingly, plasma from the xenograft-bearing mice activated the AHR pathway and augmented tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) levels in venous endothelial cells in an AHR-dependent manner. Consistent with these findings, the endothelium from the IVC of xenograft-bearing animals revealed nuclear AHR and upregulated TF and PAI-1 expression, telltale signs of an activated AHR-TF/PAI-1 axis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of AHR activity suppressed TF and PAI-1 expression in endothelial cells of the IVC and reduced clot weights in both kynurenine-injected and xenograft-bearing mice. Together, these data show dysregulated tryptophan metabolites in a mouse cancer model, and they reveal a novel link between these metabolites and the control of the AHR-TF/PAI-1 axis and VTE in cancer.","2019","2019 Dec 26","Mostafa Belghasem; Daniel Roth; Sean Richards; Marc Arthur Napolene; Joshua Walker; Wenqing Yin; Nkiruka Arinze; Chimera Lyle; Cheryl Spencer; Jean M Francis; Cristal Thompson; Christopher Andry; Stephen A Whelan; Norman Lee; Katya Ravid; Vipul C Chitalia","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and.; Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.; Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.; Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.; Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.; Department of Surgery, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, MA.; Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and.; Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.; Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.; Whitaker Cardiovascular Institute, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and.; Chemical Instrumentation Center, Boston University, Boston, MA.; Chemical Instrumentation Center, Boston University, Boston, MA.; Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.; Whitaker Cardiovascular Institute, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.; Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.; Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA; and.; Global Co-Creation Labs, Institute of Medical Engineering and Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA."

However, the metabolic alterations caused by azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) are still unknown. In the present study, a mice colon cancer model was established by treatment with AOM/DSS. LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics studies were performed to analyze metabolic alterations at the tissue level. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to identify differentially expressed metabolites. Nineteen distinct metabolites were identified that were associated with disruptions in the following pathways: biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, pyrimidine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, folate biosynthesis, and inositol phosphate metabolism. Furthermore, six significantly altered metabolites were involved in these six pathways. Compared with the Model group, the expression of cytosine, deoxyuridine, 20-hydroxy-leukotriene E4, and L-homocysteic acid was lower, whereas that of 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-6-phospho-D-gluconic acid and hematoporphyrin was higher in the EPS1-1 group.

Previous studies indicate that a methyl donor-deficient (MDD) diet lacking folic acid, choline, methionine, and vitamin B12 is associated with long-lasting changes to the intestinal epithelium and sustained tumor protection in Apc-mutant mice. However, the metabolic pathways by which the MDD diet affects these changes are unknown. Colon samples harvested from ApcΔ14/+ mice fed the MDD diet for 18 weeks were profiled using a GC-MS and LC-MS/MS metabolomics platform. Random forest and pathway analyses were used to identify altered metabolic pathways, and associated gene expression changes were analyzed by RT-PCR. Approximately 100 metabolites affected by the MDD diet were identified. As expected, metabolites within the methionine cycle, including methionine (-2.9-fold, P < 0.001) and betaine (-3.3-fold, P < 0.001), were reduced. Elevated homocysteine (110-fold, P < 0.001) was associated with increased flux through the transsulfuration pathway. Unexpectedly, levels of deoxycholic acid (-4.5-fold, P < 0.05) and several other secondary bile acids were reduced. There were also unexpected reductions in the levels of carnitine (-2.0-fold, P < 0.01) and a panel of acylcarnitines involved in fatty acid β-oxidation. Finally, metabolites involved in redox balance, including ascorbate and hypotaurine, were found to be persistently elevated. These findings provide clues to the molecular changes underlying MDD-mediated tumor protection and identify regulatable metabolic pathways that may provide new targets for colon cancer prevention and treatment.

Activation of the WNT pathway ultimately leads to the nuclear translocation of β-catenin which, in complex with TCF/LEF factors, promotes the transcription of genes necessary for growth. The proto-oncogene MYC is one of the most critical genes activated downstream the WNT pathway in colon cancer. Here, we investigate the converse regulation of the WNT pathway by MYC. We performed RNA-seq analyses to identify genes regulated in cells expressing MYC. We validated the regulation of genes in the WNT pathway including LEF1 by MYC using RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and ChIP-seq. We investigated the importance of LEF1 for the viability of MYC-expressing cells in in fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and colon cells. Bioinformatic analyses were utilized to define the expression of MYC-regulated genes in human colon cancer and metabolomics analyses were used to identify pathways regulated by LEF1 in MYC expressing cells. MYC regulates the levels of numerous WNT-related genes, including the β-catenin co-transcription factor LEF1. MYC activates the transcription of LEF1 and is required for LEF1 expression in colon cancer cells and in primary colonic cells transformed by APC loss of function, a common mutation in colon cancer patients. LEF1 caused the retention of β-catenin in the nucleus, leading to the activation of the WNT pathway in MYC-expressing cells. Consequently, MYC-expressing cells were sensitive to LEF1 inhibition. Moreover, we describe two examples of genes induced in MYC-expressing cells that require LEF1 activity: the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARδ) and the Acyl CoA dehydrogenase 9 (ACAD9). We demonstrated that MYC is a transcriptional regulator of LEF1 in colonic cells. Our work proposes a novel pathway by which MYC regulates proliferation through activating LEF1 expression which in turn activates the WNT pathway.","2019","2019 Oct 17","Yi-Heng Hao; M Carmen Lafita-Navarro; Lauren Zacharias; Nofit Borenstein-Auerbach; Min Kim; Spencer Barnes; Jiwoong Kim; Jerry Shay; Ralph J DeBerardinis; Maralice Conacci-Sorrell","Department of Cell Biology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.; Department of Cell Biology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Children's Research Institute, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.; Department of Cell Biology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.; Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.; Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.; Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.; Department of Cell Biology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.; Harold C.

This dose was selected for further metabolomic analysis, which revealed that 81 metabolites, such glutathione (GSH), phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and creatine, and 17 metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, pyruvate metabolism, and GSH metabolism, were significantly altered after Al exposure. The RT-qPCR results further confirmed these findings.

Amongst the phenotypic changes exhibited by tumor cells, a wide range of glycosylation has been reported for colon cancer-derived cell lines and CRC tissues. These aberrant modifications affect different aspects of glycosylation, including an increase in core fucosylation and GlcNAc branching on N-glycans, alteration of O-glycans, upregulated sialylation, and O-GlcNAcylation. Although O-GlcNAcylation and complex glycosylations differ in many aspects, sparse evidences report on the interference of O-GlcNAcylation with complex glycosylation. Nevertheless, this relationship is still a matter of debate. Combining different approaches on three human colon cell lines (HT29, HCT116 and CCD841CoN), it is herein reported that silencing O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT, the sole enzyme driving O-GlcNAcylation), only slightly affects overall N- and O-glycosylation patterns. Interestingly, silencing of OGT in HT29 cells upregulates E-cadherin (a major actor of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition) and changes its glycosylation. On the other hand, OGT silencing perturbs biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids resulting in a decrease in gangliosides and an increase in globosides. Together, these results provide novel insights regarding the selective regulation of complex glycosylations by O-GlcNAcylation in colon cancer cells.","2019","2019 Nov","James Biwi; Charlotte Clarisse; Christophe Biot; Radoslaw Pawel Kozak; Katarina Madunic; Marlène Mortuaire; Manfred Wuhrer; Daniel Ian Richard Spencer; Céline Schulz; Yann Guerardel; Tony Lefebvre; Anne-Sophie Vercoutter-Edouart","Université de Lille, CNRS, UMR 8576, UGSF, Unité de Glycobiologie Structurale et Fonctionnelle, F-59000, Lille, France.; Université de Lille, CNRS, UMR 8576, UGSF, Unité de Glycobiologie Structurale et Fonctionnelle, F-59000, Lille, France.; Université de Lille, CNRS, UMR 8576, UGSF, Unité de Glycobiologie Structurale et Fonctionnelle, F-59000, Lille, France.; Ludger Ltd, Culham Science Centre, OX14 3EB, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom.; Leiden University Medical Centre, Centre for Proteomics and Metabolomics, 2333ZA, Leiden, Netherlands.; Université de Lille, CNRS, UMR 8576, UGSF, Unité de Glycobiologie Structurale et Fonctionnelle, F-59000, Lille, France.; Leiden University Medical Centre, Centre for Proteomics and Metabolomics, 2333ZA, Leiden, Netherlands.; Ludger Ltd, Culham Science Centre, OX14 3EB, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom.; Université de Lille, CNRS, UMR 8576, UGSF, Unité de Glycobiologie Structurale et Fonctionnelle, F-59000, Lille, France.; Université de Lille, CNRS, UMR 8576, UGSF, Unité de Glycobiologie Structurale et Fonctionnelle, F-59000, Lille, France.; Université de Lille, CNRS, UMR 8576, UGSF, Unité de Glycobiologie Structurale et Fonctionnelle, F-59000, Lille, France.; Université de Lille, CNRS, UMR 8576, UGSF, Unité de Glycobiologie Structurale et Fonctionnelle, F-59000, Lille, France."

Understanding the biological processes responsible for the development and progression of colorectal cancer could aid the development of new diagnostic and treatment approaches. We used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis to measure metabolite levels in pairs of colorectal cancer tissue samples and samples of the adjacent macroscopically normal mucosal tissue from 10 colon cancer patients. Regarding nucleotide metabolomic intermediates, the colorectal cancer tissue contained lower levels of ribulose 5-phosphate and higher levels of xanthine, adenine, and hypoxanthine than the normal tissue. The levels of antioxidant metabolites, such as sulfur-containing amino acids, were also significantly higher in the colorectal cancer tissue. The level of tryptophan was decreased, and the levels of molecules downstream of the tryptophan pathway, such as kynurenine and quinolinic acid, which protect colorectal cancer against the host's immune system and function in de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthesis, were increased in the colorectal cancer tissue. The colorectal cancer tissue samples also contained higher levels of lysophospholipids and fatty acids, especially stearic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids, including arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Thus, understanding these cancer-specific alterations could make it possible to detect colorectal cancer early and aid the development of additional treatments for the disease, leading to improvements in colorectal cancer patients' quality of life.","2019","2019 May 24","Megumi Kibi; Shin Nishiumi; Takashi Kobayashi; Yuzo Kodama; Masaru Yoshida","Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.; Division of Metabolomics Research, Department of Internal Related, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.; AMED-CREST, AMED, Kobe, Japan."

We isolated EVs by ultracentrifugation from 25 ascitic fluids and 25 peritoneal lavages from non-cancer and CRC patients, respectively. Analysis of the expression of EV-associated miRNAs was performed using Taqman OpenArray technology through which we could detect 371 miRNAs. 210 miRNAs were significantly dysregulated (adjusted p value < 0.05 and abs(logFC) ≥ 1).

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) is a nuclear receptor that regulates systemic lipid homeostasis. We explored the role of intestinal PPARα in colon carcinogenesis. Colon cancer was induced in mice with intestine-specific disruption of Ppara (PparaΔIE), Pparafl/fl (control), and mice with disruption of Ppara that express human PPARA (human PPARA transgenic mice), by administration of azoxymethane with or without dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Colons were collected from mice and analyzed by immunoblots, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and histopathology. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analyses were performed on urine and colons. We used molecular biology and biochemical approaches to study mechanisms in mouse colons, primary intestinal epithelial cells, and colon cancer cell lines. Gene expression data and clinical features of patients with colorectal tumors were obtained from Oncomine, and human colorectal-tumor specimens and adjacent normal tissues were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Levels of Ppara messenger RNA were reduced in colon tumors from mice. PparaΔIE mice developed more and larger colon tumors than control mice following administration of azoxymethane, with or without DSS. Metabolomic analyses revealed increases in methylation-related metabolites in urine and colons from PparaΔIE mice, compared with control mice, following administration of azoxymethane, with or without DSS. Levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) were increased in colon tumors from PparaΔIE mice, compared with colon tumors from control mice. Depletion of PPARα reduced the expression of retinoblastoma protein, resulting in increased expression of DNMT1 and PRMT6. DNMT1 and PRMT6 decreased expression of the tumor suppressor genes Cdkn1a (P21) and Cdkn1b (p27) via DNA methylation and histone H3R2 dimethylation-mediated repression of transcription, respectively. Fenofibrate protected human PPARA transgenic mice from azoxymethane and DSS-induced colon cancer. Human colon adenocarcinoma specimens had lower levels of PPARA and retinoblastoma protein and higher levels of DNMT1 and PRMT6 than normal colon tissues. Loss of PPARα from the intestine promotes colon carcinogenesis by increasing DNMT1-mediated methylation of P21 and PRMT6-mediated methylation of p27 in mice. Human colorectal tumors have lower levels of PPARA messenger RNA and protein than nontumor tissues. Agents that activate PPARα might be developed for chemoprevention or treatment of colon cancer.","2019","2019 Sep","Yuhong Luo; Cen Xie; Chad N Brocker; Jie Fan; Xuan Wu; Lijin Feng; Qiong Wang; Jie Zhao; Dasheng Lu; Mayank Tandon; Maggie Cam; Kristopher W Krausz; Weiwei Liu; Frank J Gonzalez","Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Department of Pathology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Central Laboratory and Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai Skin Disease Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Pathology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.; Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; CCR Collaborative Bioinformatics Resource, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland; Advanced Biomedical Computational Science, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, Maryland.; CCR Collaborative Bioinformatics Resource, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Central Laboratory and Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai Skin Disease Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.

In this study, we assess the effects of dietary supplementation with walnuts on colonic mucosal injury induced in mice by the ulcerogenic agent, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). C57Bl/6J mice were started on the Total Western Diet supplemented with freshly-ground whole walnuts (0, 3.5, 7 and 14% g/kg) 2 weeks prior to a 5-day DSS treatment and walnut diets were continued throughout the entire experimental period. Mice were examined at 2 days or 10 days after withdrawal of DSS. In a separate study, a discovery-based metabolite profiling analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed on fecal samples and colonic mucosa following two weeks of walnut supplementation. Dietary walnut supplementation showed significant effects in the 10-day post-DSS recovery-phase study, in which the extent of ulceration was significantly reduced (7.5% vs. 0.3%, p < 0.05) with 14% walnuts. In the metabolite-profiling analysis, walnuts caused a significant increase in several polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 9-oxo-10(E),12(E)-octadecadienoic acid (9-oxoODA), as well as kynurenic acid. In colon tissue samples, walnuts caused a significant increase in the levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and betaine, important components of fatty acid β-oxidation.

However, the mechanism controlling this reprogramming is poorly understood. We searched for upregulated signaling in metastatic colorectal cancer and investigated the mechanism by which Glut3 promotes tumor metastasis. Methods: We compared RNA levels and glycolytic capacity in primary and metastatic colon cancer. The expression and association of Glut3 with clinical prognosis in colon cancer tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry. Glut3 gain-of-function and loss-of-function were established using colon cancer HCT116, HT29, and metastatic 116-LM cells, and tumor invasiveness and stemness properties were evaluated. Metabolomic profiles were analyzed by GC/MS and CE-TOF/MS. The metastatic burden in mice fed a high-fat sucrose diet was assessed by intravenous inoculation with Glut3 knockdown 116-LM cells. Results: Upregulation of glycolytic genes and glycolytic capacity was detected in metastatic colorectal cancer cells. Specifically, Glut3 overexpression was associated with metastasis and poor survival in colorectal cancer patients. Mechanistically, Glut3 promoted invasiveness and stemness in a Yes-associated protein (YAP)-dependent manner. Activation of YAP in turn transactivated Glut3 and regulated a group of glycolytic genes. Interestingly, the expression and phosphorylation of PKM2 were concomitantly upregulated in metastatic colorectal cancer, and it was found to interact with YAP and enhance the expression of Glut3. Importantly, a high-fat high-sucrose diet promoted tumor metastasis, whereas the inhibition of either Glut3 or YAP effectively reduced the metastatic burden. Conclusion: Activation of the Glut3-YAP signaling pathway acts as a master activator to reprogram cancer metabolism and thereby promotes metastasis. Our findings reveal the importance of metabolic reprogramming in supporting cancer metastasis as well as possible therapeutic targets.","2019","2019","Chih-Chia Kuo; Hsiang-Hsi Ling; Ming-Chen Chiang; Chu-Hung Chung; Wen-Ying Lee; Cheng-Ying Chu; Yu-Chih Wu; Cheng-Hsun Chen; Yi-Wen Lai; I-Lin Tsai; Chia-Hsiung Cheng; Cheng-Wei Lin","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Cytopathology, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; TMU Research Center of Cancer Translational Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Center for Cell Therapy and Regeneration Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Center for Cell Therapy and Regeneration Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan."

In a previous study, we showed that inhibition of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-like-2 (NFE2L2; NRF2), a master regulator of many genes coping with electrophilic and oxidative stress, elevated the level of miR-181c and induced mitochondrial dysfunction in colon cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrate that NRF2-silencing hindered HIF-1α accumulation in hypoxic breast cancer cells and subsequently suppressed hypoxia-inducible expression of glycolysis-associated glucose transporter-1, hexokinase-2, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1, and lactate dehydrogenase A. HIF-1α dysregulation in NRF2-silenced cancer cells was associated with miR-181c elevation. Overexpression of miR-181c in breast cancer cells blocked HIF-1α accumulation and diminished hypoxia-inducible levels of glycolysis enzymes, whereas the inhibition of miR-181c in NRF2-silenced cells restored HIF-1α accumulation. In a subsequent metabolomic analysis, hypoxic incubation increased the levels of metabolites involved in glycolysis and activated the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in control cells. However, these elevations were less pronounced in NRF2-silenced cells. In particular, hypoxic incubation increased the levels of amino acids, which implies a shift to catabolic metabolism, and the increased levels were higher in control cells than in NRF2-silenced cells. Concurrently, hypoxia activated BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3)-mediated autophagy in the control cells and miR-181c was found to be involved in this autophagy activation. Taken together, these results show that hypoxia-induced metabolic changes to glycolysis, the PPP, and autophagy are inhibited by NRF2-silencing through miR-181c-mediated HIF-1α dysregulation. Therefore, targeting NRF2/miR-181c could be an effective strategy to counteract HIF-1α-orchestrated metabolic adaptation of hypoxic cancer cells.","2019","2019 Jun","Sujin Lee; Steffanus Pranoto Hallis; Kyeong-Ah Jung; Dayoung Ryu; Mi-Kyoung Kwak","Department of Pharmacy and BK21PLUS Team for Creative Leader Program for Pharmacomics-based Future Pharmacy, Graduate School of The Catholic University of Korea, 43 Jibong-ro, Bucheon, Gyeonggi-do, 14662, Republic of Korea.; Department of Pharmacy and BK21PLUS Team for Creative Leader Program for Pharmacomics-based Future Pharmacy, Graduate School of The Catholic University of Korea, 43 Jibong-ro, Bucheon, Gyeonggi-do, 14662, Republic of Korea; Faculty of Biotechnology, Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia, Jakarta, 12930, Indonesia.; Integrated Research Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, The Catholic University of Korea, Republic of Korea.; Department of Pharmacy and BK21PLUS Team for Creative Leader Program for Pharmacomics-based Future Pharmacy, Graduate School of The Catholic University of Korea, 43 Jibong-ro, Bucheon, Gyeonggi-do, 14662, Republic of Korea.; Department of Pharmacy and BK21PLUS Team for Creative Leader Program for Pharmacomics-based Future Pharmacy, Graduate School of The Catholic University of Korea, 43 Jibong-ro, Bucheon, Gyeonggi-do, 14662, Republic of Korea; Integrated Research Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, The Catholic University of Korea, Republic of Korea; College of Pharmacy, The Catholic University of Korea, Republic of Korea.

To date, faecal metabolomics is still in its infancy and the compounds of low abundance present in faecal extracts poorly characterised. In this study, extracts of faeces from healthy subjects were profiled using a sensitive nanoflow-nanospray LC-MS platform which resulted in highly repeatable peak retention times (<2% CV) and intensities (<15% CV). Analysis of the extracts revealed wide coverage of the faecal metabolome including detection of low abundant signalling compounds such as sex steroids and eicosanoids, alongside highly abundant pharmaceuticals and tetrapyrrole metabolites. A small pilot study investigating differences in metabolomics profiles of faecal samples obtained from 7 CRC, 25 adenomatous polyp and 26 healthy groups revealed that secondary bile acids, conjugated androgens, eicosanoids, phospholipids and an unidentified haem metabolite were potential classes of metabolites that discriminated between the CRC and control sample groups. However, much larger follow up studies are needed to confirm which components of the faecal metabolome are associated with actual CRC disease rather than dietary influences.

Although the involvement of CDX genes in the regulation of the expression levels of a few glycosyltransferases has been shown, associations between glycosylation phenotypes and CDX1 mRNA expression have hitherto not been well studied. Triggered by our previous study, we here characterized the N-glycomic phenotype of 16 colon cancer cell lines, selected for their differential CDX1 mRNA expression levels. We found that high CDX1 mRNA expression associated with a higher degree of multi-fucosylation on N-glycans, which is in line with our previous results and was supported by up-regulated gene expression of fucosyltransferases involved in antenna fucosylation. Interestingly, hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF)4A and HNF1A were, among others, positively associated with high CDX1 mRNA expression and have been previously proven to regulate antenna fucosylation. Besides fucosylation, we found that high CDX1 mRNA expression in cancer cell lines also associated with low levels of sialylation and galactosylation and high levels of bisection on N-glycans. Altogether, our data highlight a possible role of CDX1 in altering the N-glycosylation of colorectal cancer cells, which is a hallmark of tumor development.","2019","2019 Mar 22","Stephanie Holst; Jennifer L Wilding; Kamila Koprowska; Yoann Rombouts; Manfred Wuhrer","Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands. stephanie.holst@gmx.net.; Cancer and Immunogenetics Laboratory, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK. wildingjl@gmail.com.; Cancer and Immunogenetics Laboratory, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK. kamila.koprowska@gmail.com.; Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands. yoann.rombouts@ipbs.fr.; Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, IPBS, Université de Toulouse, CNRS, UPS, 31077 Toulouse, France. yoann.rombouts@ipbs.fr.; Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands. m.wuhrer@lumc.nl."

We explored cell sensitivity to calcium electroporation and electroporation with bleomycin, using viability assays at different time and temperature points, as well as heat calorimetry, lipidomics, and flow cytometry. Three cell lines: HT29 (colon cancer), MDA-MB231 (breast cancer), and HDF-n (normal fibroblasts) were investigated for; (a) cell survival dependent on time of addition of drug relative to electroporation (1.2 kV/cm, 8 pulses, 99 µs, 1 Hz), at different temperatures (37 °C, 27 °C, 17 °C); (b) heat capacity profiles obtained by differential scanning calorimetry without added calcium; (c) lipid composition by mass spectrometry; (d) phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane outer leaflet using flow cytometry. Temperature as well as time of drug administration affected treatment efficacy in HT29 and HDF-n cells, but not MDA-MB231 cells. Interestingly the HT29 cell line displayed a higher phase transition temperature (approximately 20 °C) versus 14 °C (HDF-n) and 15 °C (MDA-MB231). Furthermore the HT29 cell membranes had a higher ratio of ethers to esters, and a higher expression of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet. In conclusion, lipid composition and heat capacity of the membrane might influence permeabilisation of cells and thereby the effect of calcium electroporation and electrochemotherapy.","2019","2019 Mar 18","K L Hoejholt; T Mužić; S D Jensen; L T Dalgaard; M Bilgin; J Nylandsted; T Heimburg; S K Frandsen; J Gehl","Center for Experimental Drug and Gene Electrotransfer, Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Herlev, Denmark.; Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Center for Experimental Drug and Gene Electrotransfer, Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Herlev, Denmark.; Department of Science and Environment, Roskilde University, Roskilde, Denmark.; Danish Cancer Society Research Center (DCRC), Copenhagen, Denmark.; Danish Cancer Society Research Center (DCRC), Copenhagen, Denmark.; Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Center for Experimental Drug and Gene Electrotransfer, Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Herlev, Denmark. stfra@regionsjaelland.dk.; Center for Experimental Drug and Gene Electrotransfer, Department of Clinical Oncology and Palliative Care, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark. stfra@regionsjaelland.dk.; Center for Experimental Drug and Gene Electrotransfer, Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Herlev, Denmark. kgeh@regionsjaelland.dk.; Center for Experimental Drug and Gene Electrotransfer, Department of Clinical Oncology and Palliative Care, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark. kgeh@regionsjaelland.dk.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. kgeh@regionsjaelland.dk."

It is well recognized to regulate glycolysis and is a target for therapy. However, how tumor cells adapt to grow in the absence of HIF1α is poorly understood and an important concept to understand for developing targeted therapies is the flexibility of the metabolic response to hypoxia via alternative pathways. We analyzed pathways that allow cells to survive hypoxic stress in the absence of HIF1α, using the HCT116 colon cancer cell line with deleted HIF1α versus control. Spheroids were used to provide a 3D model of metabolic gradients. We conducted a metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analysis and integrated the results. These showed surprisingly that in three-dimensional growth, a key regulatory step of glycolysis is Aldolase A rather than phosphofructokinase. Furthermore, glucose uptake could be maintained in hypoxia through upregulation of GLUT14, not previously recognized in this role. Finally, there was a marked adaptation and change of phosphocreatine energy pathways, which made the cells susceptible to inhibition of creatine metabolism in hypoxic conditions. Overall, our studies show a complex adaptation to hypoxia that can bypass HIF1α, but it is targetable and it provides new insight into the key metabolic pathways involved in cancer growth. IMPLICATIONS: Under hypoxia and HIF1 blockade, cancer cells adapt their energy metabolism via upregulation of the GLUT14 glucose transporter and creatine metabolism providing new avenues for drug targeting.","2019","2019 Jul","Alessandro Valli; Matteo Morotti; Christos E Zois; Patrick K Albers; Tomoyoshi Soga; Katharina Feldinger; Roman Fischer; Martin Frejno; Alan McIntyre; Esther Bridges; Syed Haider; Francesca M Buffa; Dilair Baban; Miguel Rodriguez; Oscar Yanes; Hannah J Whittington; Hannah A Lake; Sevasti Zervou; Craig A Lygate; Benedikt M Kessler; Adrian L Harris","Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. alevalli14@gmail.com alessandro.valli@cardiologicomonzino.it.; Target Discovery Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, Japan.; Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Target Discovery Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Target Discovery Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Metabolomics Platform, IISPV, Department of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Spanish Biomedical Research Center in Diabetes and Associated Metabolic Disorders-CIBERDEM, Madrid, Spain.; Metabolomics Platform, IISPV, Department of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Spanish Biomedical Research Center in Diabetes and Associated Metabolic Disorders-CIBERDEM, Madrid, Spain.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Target Discovery Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."

Using a metabolomics approach, we report here that epoxygenated fatty acids (EpFA), which are eicosanoid metabolites produced by cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenases, were increased in both the plasma and colon of azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colon cancer mice. CYP monooxygenases were overexpressed in colon tumor tissues and colon cancer cells. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic ablation of CYP monooxygenases suppressed AOM/DSS-induced colon tumorigenesis in vivo. In addition, treatment with 12,13-epoxyoctadecenoic acid (EpOME), which is a metabolite of CYP monooxygenase produced from linoleic acid, increased cytokine production and JNK phosphorylation in vitro and exacerbated AOM/DSS-induced colon tumorigenesis in vivo. Together, these results demonstrate that the previously unappreciated CYP monooxygenase pathway is upregulated in colon cancer, contributes to its pathogenesis, and could be therapeutically explored for preventing or treating colon cancer.

Methionine adenosyltransferases (MAT) produce the cellular methyl donor, S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe). Dysregulation of SAMe level is a relevant event in many diseases, including cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma and colon cancer. In addition, mutation of Arg264 in MATα1 causes isolated persistent hypermethioninemia, which is characterized by low activity of the enzyme in liver and high level of plasma methionine. In mammals, MATα1/α2 and MATβV1/V2 are the catalytic and the major form of regulatory subunits, respectively. A gating loop comprising residues 113-131 is located beside the active site of catalytic subunits (MATα1/α2) and provides controlled access to the active site. Here, we provide evidence of how the gating loop facilitates the catalysis and define some of the key elements that control the catalytic efficiency. Mutation of several residues of MATα2 including Gln113, Ser114, and Arg264 lead to partial or total loss of enzymatic activity, demonstrating their critical role in catalysis. The enzymatic activity of the mutated enzymes is restored to varying degrees upon complex formation with MATβV1 or MATβV2, endorsing its role as an allosteric regulator of MATα2 in response to the levels of methionine or SAMe. Finally, the protein-protein interacting surface formed in MATα2:MATβ complexes is explored to demonstrate that several quinolone-based compounds modulate the activity of MATα2 and its mutants, providing a rational for chemical design/intervention responsive to the level of SAMe in the cellular environment.

However, the systemic mechanistic link between feces and colonic tissues of CRC patients is still limited. The current study was a paralleled investigation of colonic tumor tissues and their normal adjacent tissues alongside patient-matched feces by using 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with pattern recognition to investigate how fecal metabolic phenotypes are linked to the changes in colorectal tumor profiles. A set of overlapping discriminatory metabolites across feces and tumor tissues of CRC were identified, including elevated levels of lactate, glutamate, alanine, succinate and reduced amounts of butyrate. These changes could indicate the networks for metabolic pathway perturbations in CRC potentially involved in the disruptions of glucose and glycolytic metabolism, TCA cycle, glutaminolysis, and short chain fatty acids metabolism. Furthermore, changes in fecal acetate were positively correlated with alterations of glucose and myo-inositol in colorectal tumor tissues, implying enhanced energy production for rapid cell proliferation. Compared to other fecal metabolites, acetate demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for diagnosing CRC, with an AUC of 0.843 in the training set, and a good predictive ability in the validation set. Overall, these associations provide evidence of distinct metabolic signatures and metabolic pathway disturbances between the colonic tissues and feces within the same individual, and changes of fecal metabolic signature could reflect the CRC tissue microenvironment, highlighting the significance of the distinct fecal metabolic profiles as potential novel and noninvasive relevant indicators for CRC detection.","2019","2019 Sep 15","Yan Lin; Changchun Ma; Tedros Bezabeh; Zhening Wang; Jiahao Liang; Yao Huang; Jiayun Zhao; Xinmu Liu; Wei Ye; Wan Tang; Ting Ouyang; Renhua Wu","Department of Radiology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.; Radiation Oncology, Cancer Hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.; College of Natural & Applied Sciences, University of Guam, UOG Station, Mangilao, Guam.; Department of Radiology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.; Department of Radiology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.; Department of Radiology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.; Department of Radiology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.; Department of Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.; Department of Radiology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.; Department of Radiology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.; Department of Radiology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.; Department of Radiology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China."

However, metabolite biomarkers discovered in biofluids may not necessarily reflect the pathological status of tumor tissue, which makes these biomarkers difficult to reproduce. In this study, we developed a new analysis strategy by integrating the univariate and multivariate correlation analysis approach to discover tumor tissue derived (TTD) metabolites in plasma samples. Specifically, untargeted metabolomics was first used to profile a set of paired tissue and plasma samples from 34 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Next, univariate correlation analysis was used to select correlative metabolite pairs between tissue and plasma, and a random forest regression model was utilized to define 243 TTD metabolites in plasma samples. The TTD metabolites in CRC plasma were demonstrated to accurately reflect the pathological status of tumor tissue and have great potential for metabolite biomarker discovery. Accordingly, we conducted a clinical study using a set of 146 plasma samples from CRC patients and gender-matched polyp controls to discover metabolite biomarkers from TTD metabolites. As a result, eight metabolites were selected as potential biomarkers for CRC diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity. For CRC patients after surgery, the survival risk score defined by metabolite biomarkers also performed well in predicting overall survival time ( p = 0.022) and progression-free survival time ( p = 0.002). In conclusion, we developed a new analysis strategy which effectively discovers tumor tissue related metabolite biomarkers in plasma for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.","2019","2019 Feb 05","Zhuozhong Wang; Binbin Cui; Fan Zhang; Yue Yang; Xiaotao Shen; Zhong Li; Weiwei Zhao; Yuanyuan Zhang; Kui Deng; Zhiwei Rong; Kai Yang; Xiwen Yu; Kang Li; Peng Han; Zheng-Jiang Zhu","Interdisciplinary Research Center on Biology and Chemistry, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200032 , P.R.

However, the underlying biological mechanism that can account for these differences is unclear. In this study, plasma metabolic profiles in 147 LCC patients and 105 RCC patients were systematically analyzed by the ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) platform in conjunction with univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Metabolic signatures revealed considerable differences between patients with RCC and LCC, and clear separations were observed between the two groups in partial least-squares discriminant analysis score plots. In total, six metabolites were identified as potential metabolite markers for tumor location in RCC compared with LCC, including upregulated trimethylamine N-oxide and indoxyl sulfate, and downregulated anserine, L-targinine, gamma-glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyraldehyde and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. These differences highlight that significant alternations occur in the pathways of methane metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, histidine metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism and vitamin B6 metabolism in RCC compared with LCC. Identified biomarkers and metabolic pathways may facilate our understanding of the different mortality rates and prognoses between RCC and LCC.","2018","2018 Dec","Kui Deng; Peng Han; Wei Song; Zhuozhong Wang; Fan Zhang; Hongyu Xie; Weiwei Zhao; Huan Xu; Yuqing Cai; Zhiwei Rong; Xiwen Yu; Bin-Bin Cui; Kang Li","Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.; Department of Colorectal Surgery, The Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.; Heilongjiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.; Department of Colorectal Surgery, The Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.

In particular, carnosic acid (CA), carnosol (CS) and rosmanol (RS) diterpenes have shown interesting results on anti-cancer activity. However, little is known about the toxic effects of rosemary diterpenes at the concentrations needed to exert their antiproliferative effect on cancer cells. In our study, CA, CS and RS exhibited a concentration-dependent effect on cell viability of two human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29 and HCT116) after 24 h exposure. HT-29 cell line was more resistant to the inhibitory effect of the three diterpenes than HCT116 cell line. Among the three diterpenes, RS exerted the strongest effect in both cell lines. To investigate the hepatotoxicity of CA, CS and RS, undifferentiated and differentiated HepaRG cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of the diterpenes (from 10 to 100 μM). Differentiated cells were found to be more resistant to the toxic activity of the three diterpenes than undifferentiated HepaRG, probably related to a higher detoxifying function of differentiated HepaRG cells compared with the undifferentiated cells. The metabolic profiles of differentiated HepaRG cells in response to CA, CS and RS were examined to determine biochemical alterations and deepen the study of the effects of rosemary phenolic diterpenes at molecular level. A multiplatform metabolomics study based on liquid- and gas-chromatography hyphenated to high resolution mass spectrometry revealed that rosemary diterpenes exerted different effects when HepaRG cells were treated with the same concentration of each diterpene. RS revealed a greater metabolome alteration followed by CS and CA, in agreement with their observed cytotoxicity. Metabolomics provided valuable information about early events in the metabolic profiles after the treatment with the investigated diterpenes from rosemary.","2018","2018 Dec 11","Tanize Acunha; Virginia García-Cañas; Alberto Valdés; Alejandro Cifuentes; Carolina Simó","CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil, 70040-020 Brasília, DF, Brazil; Laboratory of Foodomics, Institute of Food Science Research (CIAL, CSIC), Nicolas Cabrera 9, 28049 Madrid, Spain.; Molecular Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute of Food Science Research (CIAL, CSIC), Nicolas Cabrera 9, 28049 Madrid, Spain.

In this study, cytotoxic effect of celastrol against HCT116 colon cancer cells was investigated based on cell viability assay and flow cytometry assay, and the possible mechanism was explored using a strategy combining metabolic profiling and targeted metabolite analysis based on ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)/MS. Celastrol was found to inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells and induce apoptosis. Metabolomics analysis revealed characteristic changes in metabolic profiles of the colon cancer cells, revealing altered levels of amino acids, carnitine, and lipid markers. Most interestingly, with the assistance of targeted metabolite analysis, tryptophan (Trp) level was significantly increased whereas kynurenine (Kyn) level was decreased in colon cancer cells after celastrol treatment, together with markedly declined Kyn/Trp ratios. Western blot analysis revealed that expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the enzyme catalyzing Trp to generate Kyn, was dramatically inhibited in colon cancer cells after celastrol treatment, with a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that suppression of IDO expression and tryptophan catabolism may be part of the mechanisms of celastrol in its cytotoxic effect against HCT116 colon cancer cells. This study provided scientific basis for further development of celastrol on treating colon cancer.","2018","2018","Yunpeng Qi; Renping Wang; Liang Zhao; Lei Lv; Fan Zhou; Tian Zhang; Feng Lu; Hongli Yan; Gengli Duan","School of Pharmacy, Fudan University.; School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University.; School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University.; Department of Pharmacy, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Second Military Medical University.; Department of Pharmacy, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Second Military Medical University.; Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital affiliated to Medical School of Nanjing University.; School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University.; School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University.; School of Pharmacy, Fudan University."

St.-Hil., belonging to the family Lythraceae and popularly known as 'dedaleira' and 'mangava-brava,' is a native tree of the Brazilian Cerrado, and its barks have been traditionally used as a tonic to treat inflammatory conditions, particularly related to gastric ulcers, wounds or fevers and various types of cancer. We have previously demonstrated the apoptogenic effects of the methanolic extract of L. pacari using various cancer cell lines. In the present study, this extract has been partitioned into fractions to identify the components that might be responsible for the apoptogenic effects using HRT-18 cells, which have been previously demonstrated to be sensitive to this extract. A standard methanolic extract was prepared and fractionated by centrifugal partition chromatography. The fractions were submitted to cytotoxicity and clonogenic assays to monitor the effects in parallel with LC-DAD-MS and statistical analyses to suggest the potential bioactive compounds. Besides ellagic acid, the primary constituent of the plant and also the biomarker of the species, punicalin, pedunculagin and punicalagin isomers, catechin and ellagic acid derivatives were putatively identified. The barks of L. pacari are rich in ellagic acid and various hydrolysable tannins, some of which were reported for the first time in this species, such as punicalagin and ellagitannins. This mixture of substances had the ability to kill proliferating cells and abrogate the growth of clonogenic cells in a similar manner shown by the methanolic extract of our previous study. The collective data reported herein suggest that the biological activities of the L. pacari barks used by population to treat cancer conditions are due to the apoptogenic effects promoted by a mixed content of ellagitannins.","2018","2018 Oct 05","Cristiane Loiva Reichert; D B Silva; Carlos Alexandre Carollo; Almeriane Maria Weffort-Santos; C A M Santos","Programa de Pós-graduação em Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade Federal do Paraná, Curitiba, PR, Brazil.; Laboratório de Produtos Naturais e Espectrometria de Massas, Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas, Alimentos e Nutrição, Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.; Laboratório de Produtos Naturais e Espectrometria de Massas, Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas, Alimentos e Nutrição, Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.; Departamento de Análises Clínicas, Licity of Lafoensia pacari preparations and fractions on HRaboratório de Hematologia, Universidade Federal do Paraná, Curitiba, PR, Brazil.; Departamento de Farmácia, Laboratório de Farmacognosia, Universidade Federal do Paraná, Curitiba, PR, Brazil.

However, drawing biologically relevant conclusions from this data and combining it with additional layers of information collected by other omic technologies present a significant bioinformatic challenge. To address this, a data processing approach was designed to automate the comprehensive prediction of dysregulated metabolic pathways/networks from multiple data sources. The platform autonomously integrates multiple MS-based metabolomics data types without constraints due to different sample preparation/extraction, chromatographic separation, or MS detection method. This multimodal analysis streamlines the extraction of biological information from the metabolomics data as well as the contextualization within proteomics and transcriptomics data sets. As a proof of concept, this multimodal analysis approach was applied to a colorectal cancer (CRC) study, in which complementary liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data were combined with proteomic and transcriptomic data. Our approach provided a highly resolved overview of colon cancer metabolic dysregulation, with an average 17% increase of detected dysregulated metabolites per pathway and an increase in metabolic pathway prediction confidence. Moreover, 95% of the altered metabolic pathways matched with the dysregulated genes and proteins, providing additional validation at a systems level.

Although their mode of action was evaluated previously, the molecular mechanisms of resistance development are unknown. Hence, we have established destruxin-resistant sublines of HCT116 colon carcinoma cells by selection with the most prevalent derivatives, destruxin (dtx)A, dtxB and dtxE. Various cell biological and molecular techniques were applied to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying these acquired and highly stable destruxin resistance phenotypes. Interestingly, well-known chemoresistance-mediating ABC efflux transporters were not the major players. Instead, in dtxA- and dtxB-resistant cells a hyper-activated mevalonate pathway was uncovered resulting in increased de-novo cholesterol synthesis rates and elevated levels of lanosterol, cholesterol as well as several oxysterol metabolites. Accordingly, inhibition of the mevalonate pathway at two different steps, using either statins or zoledronic acid, significantly reduced acquired but also intrinsic destruxin resistance. Vice versa, cholesterol supplementation protected destruxin-sensitive cells against their cytotoxic activity. Additionally, an increased cell membrane adhesiveness of dtxA-resistant as compared to parental cells was detected by atomic force microscopy. This was paralleled by a dramatically reduced ionophoric capacity of dtxA in resistant cells when cultured in absence but not in presence of statins. Summarizing, our results suggest a reduced ionophoric activity of destruxins due to cholesterol-mediated plasma membrane re-organization as molecular mechanism underlying acquired destruxin resistance in human colon cancer cells. Whether this mechanism might be valid also in other cell types and organisms exposed to destruxins e.g. as bio-insecticides needs to be evaluated.","2018","2018 May 22","Daniela Heilos; Clemens Röhrl; Christine Pirker; Bernhard Englinger; Dina Baier; Thomas Mohr; Michaela Schwaiger; Shahid Muhammad Iqbal; Sushilla van Schoonhoven; Kristaps Klavins; Tanja Eberhart; Ursula Windberger; Judith Taibon; Sonja Sturm; Hermann Stuppner; Gunda Koellensperger; Rita Dornetshuber-Fleiss; Walter Jäger; Rosa Lemmens-Gruber; Walter Berger","Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Center for Pathobiochemistry and Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Decentralized Biomedical Facilities of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; BIOCRATES Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria.; Center for Pathobiochemistry and Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Decentralized Biomedical Facilities of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Pharmacy, Pharmacognosy and Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Institute of Pharmacy, Pharmacognosy and Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Institute of Pharmacy, Pharmacognosy and Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Vienna Metabolomics Center, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Division of Clinical Pharmacy and Diagnostics, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."

Exposure to TCS alters gut microbiota in mice, and its proinflammatory effect is attenuated in germ-free mice. In addition, TCS treatment increases activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in vivo and fails to promote colitis in Tlr4-/- mice. Together, our results demonstrate that this widely used antimicrobial ingredient could have adverse effects on colonic inflammation and associated colon tumorigenesis through modulation of the gut microbiota and TLR4 signaling.

The chemical profiling of individual ascidian species was obtained using GC-MS, and the metabolites were determined by searching in NIST library and literature data. The principal component analysis of GC-MS mass spectral variables showed a clear discrimination of these two ascidian species based on the chemical composition and taxonomy.

We then used MICOM, an open source platform, to track the metabolic flux of hydrogen sulfide through a defined microbial community that either represented on-tumor or off-tumor sample communities. We also performed targeted and untargeted metabolomics, and used the former to quantitatively evaluate our model predictions. A deeper look at the models identified several unexpected but feasible reactions, microbes, and microbial interactions involved in hydrogen sulfide production for which our 16S and metabolomic data could not account.

In our study, we used a rapid NMR based metabolomic approach as tool to identify secondary metabolites with anti-proliferative activity against a panel of human colorectal cancer cell lines with different mutation profiles. For this purpose, fourteen Fabaceae species of Mediterranean vegetation were investigated using a double screening method: 1H NMR profiling enabled the identification of the main compounds present in the mixtures, whilst parallel biological assays allowed the selection of two plant extracts based on their strong anti-proliferative properties. Using high-resolution 2D NMR spectroscopy, putative active constituents were identified in the mixture and isolated by performing a bio-guided fractionation of the selected plant extracts. As a result, we found two active principles: a cycloartane glycoside and protodioscin derivative. Interestingly, these metabolites displayed a preferential anti-proliferative effect on colon cancer cell lines with an intrinsic resistance to anti-EGFR therapies.

Non-targeted UPLC-MS metabolite profiling was done on urine samples obtained from 24 healthy volunteers before and 8 h after the ingestion of a single meal composed of intrinsically 15 N labelled bovine meat, either cooked at 55 °C for 5 min or at 90 °C for 30 min. A discriminant analysis extension of independent components analysis was applied to the mass spectral data. After meat ingestion, the urinary excretion of 1-methylhistidine, phenylacetylglutamine, and short- and medium-chained acylcarnitines was observed. 15 N labelling was detected in these metabolites, thus confirming their origin from ingested meat. However, no difference was observed in urinary metabolomic profiles according to the meat cooking process used. Meat ingestion led to the excretion of several nitrogen-containing compounds, but although a metabolic signature was detected for meat ingestion, the impact of the cooking process was not detectable at the level of urinary metabolic signature in our experimental conditions.","2019","2019 Jan","Nadezda V Khodorova; Douglas N Rutledge; Marion Oberli; David Mathiron; Paulo Marcelo; Robert Benamouzig; Daniel Tomé; Claire Gaudichon; Serge Pilard","UMR Physiologie de la Nutrition et du Comportement Alimentaire, AgroParisTech, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Université Paris Saclay, Paris, France.; UMR 1145 Génie Industriel Alimentaire, AgroParisTech, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Université Paris Saclay, Paris, France.; UMR Physiologie de la Nutrition et du Comportement Alimentaire, AgroParisTech, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Université Paris Saclay, Paris, France.; Plateforme Analytique, Université de Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France.; Plateforme Imagerie Cellulaire et Analyse des Protéines, Université de Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France.; UMR Physiologie de la Nutrition et du Comportement Alimentaire, AgroParisTech, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Université Paris Saclay, Paris, France.; UMR Physiologie de la Nutrition et du Comportement Alimentaire, AgroParisTech, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Université Paris Saclay, Paris, France.; UMR Physiologie de la Nutrition et du Comportement Alimentaire, AgroParisTech, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Université Paris Saclay, Paris, France.; Plateforme Analytique, Université de Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France."

M1 was administered to DMH induced CRC rats at 10 and 25 mg/kg doses for 15 days. Various physiological, oxidative parameters, histopathology, ELISA, gene and protein expression studies were conducted to evaluate the anti-CRC potential of M1. The histopathology and biochemical tests indicated the protective action of M1 in DMH-induced colon cancer. ELISA confirms that M1 reduced the increased concentration of IL-6 more prominently than those of IL-2 and COX-2. Gene expression analysis revealed that M1 attenuated the increased mRNA over-expression of IL-6, JAK2 and STAT3. The result obtained from quantitative western blot analysis demonstrated that the CRC condition was produced by the IL-6 induced activation/phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 and further down-regulated with M1 treatment. This evidence was supported well with the application of data-based mathematical modeling. Applying the fitted model, we predicted the quantitative behavior of STAT3 populations not accessible to experimental measurement. Later, 1H NMR based serum metabolic profiling was carried out using rat sera to investigate the impact of M1 on CRC-induced metabolic alterations. M1 showed its ability to restore the perturbed metabolites in CRC condition.

Aerobic glycolysis reduces pyruvate flux into mitochondria, preventing a complete oxidation of glucose and shunting glucose to anabolic pathways essential for cell proliferation. Here we tested a new strategy, mitochondrial uncoupling, for its potential of antagonizing the anabolic effect of aerobic glycolysis and for its potential anticancer activities. Mitochondrial uncoupling is a process that facilitates proton influx across the mitochondrial inner membrane without generating ATP, stimulating a futile cycle of acetyl- CoA oxidation. We tested two safe mitochondrial uncouplers, NEN (niclosamide ethanolamine) and oxyclozanide, on their metabolic effects and anti-cancer activities. We used metabolomic NMR to examine the effect of mitochondrial uncoupling on glucose metabolism in colon cancer MC38 cells. We further tested the anti-cancer effect of NEN and oxyclozanide in cultured cell models, APCmin/+ mouse model, and a metastatic colon cancer mouse model. Using a metabolomic NMR approach, we demonstrated that mitochondrial uncoupling promotes pyruvate influx to mitochondria and reduces various anabolic pathway activities. Moreover, mitochondrial uncoupling inhibits cell proliferation and reduces clonogenicity of cultured colon cancer cells. Furthermore, oral treatment with mitochondrial uncouplers reduces intestinal polyp formation in APCmin/+ mice, and diminishes hepatic metastasis of colon cancer cells transplanted intrasplenically. Our data highlight a unique approach for targeting cancer cell metabolism for cancer prevention and treatment, identified two prototype compounds, and shed light on the anti-cancer mechanism of niclosamide.","2018","2018 Feb 13","Amer Alasadi; Michael Chen; G V T Swapna; Hanlin Tao; Jingjing Guo; Juan Collantes; Noor Fadhil; Gaetano T Montelione; Shengkan Jin","Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA.; Graduate Program of Physiology and Integrative Biology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA.; Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA.; Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, and Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, 679 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA.; Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA.; Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA.; Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA.; Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA.; Clinical and Translational Science Program, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA.; Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, and Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, 679 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA.; Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA. victor.jin@rutgers.edu."

In particular, it is an issue in the Northern Hemisphere where UVB radiation does not penetrate the atmosphere as readily. There is a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that cancer of the ascending (right side) colon is different from cancer of the descending (left side) colon in terms of prognosis, tumor differentiation, and polyp type, as well as at the molecular level. Right-side tumors have elevated Wnt signaling and are more likely to relapse, whereas left-side tumors have reduced expression of tumor suppressor genes. This study seeks to understand both the proteomic and metabolomic changes resulting from treatment of the active metabolite of vitamin D, calcitriol, in right-sided and left-sided colon cancer. Our results show that left-sided colon cancer treated with calcitriol has a substantially greater number of changes in both the proteome and the metabolome than right-sided colon cancer. We found that calcitriol treatment in both right-sided and left-sided colon cancer causes a downregulation of ribosomal protein L37 and protein S100A10. Both of these proteins are heavily involved in tumorigenesis, suggesting a possible mechanism for the correlation between low vitamin D levels and colon cancer.","2018","2018 Jan 11","Monica M Schroll; Katelyn R Ludwig; Kerry M Bauer; Amanda B Hummon","Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Harper Cancer Research Institute, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA.

We previously described a diagnostic metabolomic biomarker derived from semi-quantitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Our objective was to determine whether a quantitative assay of additional metabolomic features, including parts of the lipidome could enhance diagnostic power; and whether there was an advantage to deriving a combined diagnostic signature with a broader metabolomic representation. The well-characterized Biocrates P150 kit was used to quantify 163 metabolites in patients with CRC (N = 62), adenoma (N = 31), and age- and gender-matched disease-free controls (N = 81). Metabolites included in the analysis included phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, acylcarnitines, and amino acids. Using a training set of 32 CRC and 21 disease-free controls, a multivariate metabolomic orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) classifier was developed. An independent set of 28 CRC and 20 matched healthy controls was used for validation. Features characterizing 31 colorectal adenomas from their healthy matched controls were also explored, and a multivariate OPLS classifier for colorectal adenoma could be proposed. The metabolomic profile that distinguished CRC from controls consisted of 48 metabolites (R2Y = 0.83, Q2Y = 0.75, CV-ANOVA p-value < 0.00001). In this quantitative assay, the coefficient of variance for each metabolite was <10%, and this dramatically enhanced the separation of these groups. Independent validation resulted in AUROC of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.93-1.00) and sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 95%. Similarly, we were able to distinguish adenoma from controls (R2Y = 0.30, Q2Y = 0.20, CV-ANOVA p-value = 0.01; internal AUROC = 0.82 (95% CI, 0.72-0.93)). When combined with the previously generated GC-MS signatures for CRC and adenoma, the candidate biomarker performance improved slightly. The diagnostic power for metabolomic tests for colorectal neoplasia can be improved by utilizing a multimodal approach and combining metabolites from diverse chemical classes. In addition, quantification of metabolites enhances separation of disease-specific metabolomic profiles. Our future efforts will be focused on developing a quantitative assay for the metabolites comprising the optimal diagnostic biomarker.","2018","2018 Jan 04","Farshad Farshidfar; Karen A Kopciuk; Robert Hilsden; S Elizabeth McGregor; Vera C Mazurak; W Donald Buie; Anthony MacLean; Hans J Vogel; Oliver F Bathe","Department of Surgery, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Oncology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department Mathematics and Statistics, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Population Health Research, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Forzani & MacPhail Colon Cancer Screening Centre, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Oncology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Population Health Research, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.; Department of Surgery, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Surgery, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Surgery, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. bathe@ucalgary.ca.; Department of Oncology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. bathe@ucalgary.ca.; Division of Surgical Oncology, Tom Baker Cancer Centre, 1331 - 29th St NW, Calgary, AB, T2N 4N2, Canada. bathe@ucalgary.ca."

More than 45 years later, the war is still going steady, with the enemy being almost as strong as in 1971. Furthermore, the increasing rates of obesity not only among adults, but among children and adolescents, are the likely cause for the 30-year trend of colon cancer (CC) becoming a disease of the younger population in the U.S. These trends, however, have not spurred the development of novel screening approaches for CC. Considering the need for a sensitive and non-invasive detection of early stage neoplastic lesions in the colon, we propose the development of a test based on a novel concept - the concept of induced biomarkers. The proposal is based upon our findings that the food additives propolis and gamma-cyclodextrin (gCD) (a) decrease the neoplastic burden in normal weight and obese ApcMin mice, a model of early stage intestinal neoplasia, and (b) elicit significant changes in the serum proteome in ApcMin mice. We posit that gCD and propolis induce the release of neoplasm-associated biomarkers in systemic circulation (e.g., metabolites, neoplastic, apoptotic, and immune response proteins), and these markers could be used to detect early stage intestinal neoplasms. Additional dietary bioactives may also elicit a complement of induced markers. The hypothesis could be ascertained by utilizing a mouse model, the Apc+/1638Nmice, as well as through human subject studies that integrate proteomics and metabolomics analyses. The concept of detecting inducible markers of colonic neoplasms is novel, and is substantiated by the significant physiological effects of gCD and propolis on neoplastic colonic cells in culture and on early neoplastic development in ApcMinmice. The long-term objective is to develop a minimally invasive method that detects early stage neoplastic development in the human colon.","2018","2018","Michael Bordonaro; Darina Lazarova","Department of Basic Sciences, Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, 525 Pine Street, Scranton, PA 18509, USA.; Department of Basic Sciences, Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, 525 Pine Street, Scranton, PA 18509, USA."

As per this scenario, we recently prepared and tested novel 1,4-benzothiazine derivatives against HT-29 human colon cancer cell line. Two compounds namely AR13 and AR15 showed higher inhibitions among all the synthesized compounds. In the present context, we conducted the in vivo antiproliferative action and identified the molecular mechanism associated to cytotoxic action of AR13 and AR15 in dimethylhydrazine (DMH) induced colorectal carcinoma (CRC) model. Various physiological, oxidative stress, histopathology, ELISA, qRT-PCR, western blot and NMR-based metabolomics were accomplished to evaluate the anticancer effect of titled compounds. Both compounds were subjected to histological and biochemical tests to observe the protective action of the compounds. ELISA showed potential role of these compounds to normalize increased levels of IL-2, IL-6 and COX-2 mediators. This action was more pronounced for COX-2 rather than IL-2 and IL-6. Gene expression analyses further revealed that both of them attenuated the over-expressed COX-2 gene. Furthermore, it was confirmed that these compounds exerted antitumor potential via preventing COX-2 induced JAK-2 and STAT-3 phosphorylation. This action was substansiated by immunohistochemistry using JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3 and p-STAT3 targets in colon tissue. Finally, score plots of PLS-DA models exhibited significant metabolic discriminations between the treated and CRC groups, and both compounds showed ability to restore the imbalance of multiple metabolites during CRC. In conclusion, our study provided the evidence towards better antiproliferative effect of AR13 and AR15 in DMH-induced CRC through the blockade of COX-2/JAK-2/STAT-3 signal transduction pathway and could be demonstrated as useful anti-CRC candidate molecules for future anticancer therapy.","2018","2018 Jun","Amit Rai; Umesh Kumar; Vinit Raj; Ashok K Singh; Pranesh Kumar; Amit K Keshari; Dinesh Kumar; Biswanath Maity; Arnab De; Amalesh Samanta; Sneha Nath; Anand Prakash; Sunil Babu Gosipatala; Gyan Chand; Sudipta Saha","Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Vidya Vihar, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226025, India.; Centre of Biomedical Research, SGPGIMS Campus, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226014, Uttar Pradesh, India.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Vidya Vihar, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226025, India.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Vidya Vihar, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226025, India.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Vidya Vihar, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226025, India.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Vidya Vihar, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226025, India.; Centre of Biomedical Research, SGPGIMS Campus, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226014, Uttar Pradesh, India.; Centre of Biomedical Research, SGPGIMS Campus, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226014, Uttar Pradesh, India.; Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Jadavpur University, Kolkata 700032, West Bengal, India.; Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Jadavpur University, Kolkata 700032, West Bengal, India.; Department of Biotechnology, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Vidya Vihar, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226025, India.; Department of Biotechnology, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Vidya Vihar, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226025, India.; Department of Biotechnology, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Vidya Vihar, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226025, India.; Department of Endocrine Surgery, SGPGIMS Campus, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226014, Uttar Pradesh, India.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Vidya Vihar, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226025, India.

KJT contains high levels of anti-inflammatory and antioxidative compounds such as ginnalins, but little is known about the chemopreventive effect of KJT on colon cancer. In this study, we investigated the preventive effects of KJT on colon carcinogenesis using the azoxymethane (AOM)-induced precancerous colorectal lesion model in rats. The results showed that the number of aberrant crypts, aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and crypts/focus in rats of the KJT + AOM group were significantly decreased compared with rats of the AOM group (p < 0.01). Further exploration of the prevention mechanism of KJT by UPLC-QTOF/MS-based urinary metabolomics showed that 5 metabolic pathways were modulated, including purine metabolism and amino acid metabolism, in the group with KJT. In addition, the levels of the immunomodulatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-10 were significantly decreased, and the levels of IL-2 in the serum of AOM rats increased after KJT treatment. Our present data suggest that KJT can inhibit AOM-induced colonic ACF formation and might be a useful chemopreventive agent against colorectal carcinogenesis.","2017","2017 Nov 21","Wu Bi; Haibo Liu; Jie Shen; Ling-Hua Zhang; Pei Li; Bing Peng; Li Cao; Pengfei Zhang; Chunnian He; Peigen Xiao","Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China.; Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China.; Key Laboratory of Cancer Proteomics of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, People's Republic of China.; Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China.; Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China.; Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China.; Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China.; PhytoMedix Co. 628 Route 10 West, Suite 10B, Whippany, NJ, 07981, USA.; Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China.; Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China.; Beijing Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Capital Medical University, 100010, Beijing, PR China.; Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China.; Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China.; Key Laboratory of Cancer Proteomics of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, People's Republic of China.; Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China. cnhe@implad.ac.cn.; Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China. cnhe@implad.ac.cn.; Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China.; Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China."

Causes and treatments have been discussed for more than two centuries, but have not yet been fully resolved. Daikenchuto (TJ-100, DKT) is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine. Recently, some beneficial mechanisms of DKT to relieve paralytic ileus have been reported. DKT can suppress inflammation, increase intestinal blood flow, and accelerate bowel movements. Therefore, we have designed a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of DKT on postoperative gastrointestinal symptoms following laparoscopic colectomy in patients with left-sided colon cancer at a single institution. As primary endpoints, the following outcomes will be evaluated: (i) grade of abdominal pain determined using the numeric rating scale (NRS), (ii) grade of abdominal distention determined using the NRS, and (iii) quality of life determined using the Gastrointestinal Quality Life Index (GIQLI). As secondary endpoints, the following will be evaluated: (i) postoperative nutritional status (Onodera's Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) and the Controlling Nutritional Status score (CONUT score)), (ii) duration to initial flatus, (iii) duration to initial defecation, (iv) bowel gas volume, (v) character of stool (Bristol Stool Form Scale), (vi) defecation frequency per day, (vii) postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification), (viii) length of postoperative hospital stay, and (ix) metabolites in the stool and blood. This trial is an open-label study, and needs to include 40 patients (20 patients per group) and is expected to span 2 years. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of DKT on postoperative subjective outcomes (i.e., postoperative quality of life) following laparoscopic colectomy as primary endpoints. Exploratory metabolomics analysis of metabolites in stool and blood will be conducted in this trial, which previously has only been performed in a few human studies. The study aims to guide a future full-scale pragmatic randomized trial to assess the overall effectiveness of DKT to improve the postoperative quality of life following laparoscopic colectomy.

To detect bacterial markers of colorectal cancer in African Americans a metabolomic analysis was performed on fecal water extracts. DNA from stool samples of adenoma and healthy subjects and from colon cancer and matched normal tissues was analyzed to determine the microbiota composition (using 16S rDNA) and genomic content (metagenomics). Metagenomic functions with discriminative power between healthy and neoplastic specimens were established. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (q-PCR) using primers and probes specific to Streptococcus sp. VT_162 were used to validate this bacterium association with neoplastic transformation in stool samples from two independent cohorts of African Americans and Chinese patients with colorectal lesions. The metabolomic analysis of adenomas revealed low amino acids content. The microbiota in both cancer vs. normal tissues and adenoma vs. normal stool samples were different at the 16S rRNA gene level. Cross-mapping of metagenomic data led to 9 markers with significant discriminative power between normal and diseased specimens. These markers identified with Streptococcus sp. VT_162. Q-PCR data showed a statistically significant presence of this bacterium in advanced adenoma and cancer samples in an independent cohort of CRC patients. We defined metagenomic functions from Streptococcus sp. VT_162 with discriminative power among cancers vs. matched normal and adenomas vs. healthy subjects' stools. Streptococcus sp. VT_162 specific 16S rDNA was validated in an independent cohort. These findings might facilitate non-invasive screening for colorectal cancer.","2017","2017 Nov 09","Hassan Brim; Shibu Yooseph; Edward Lee; Zaki A Sherif; Muneer Abbas; Adeyinka O Laiyemo; Sudhir Varma; Manolito Torralba; Scot E Dowd; Karen E Nelson; Wimal Pathmasiri; Susan Sumner; Willem de Vos; Qiaoyi Liang; Jun Yu; Erwin Zoetendal; Hassan Ashktorab","Department of Pathology and Department of Medicine, Microbiology and Cancer Center, College of Medicine, Howard University, 2041 Georgia Avenue, Washington, DC 20060, USA. hbrim@howard.edu.; J.

Folate one-carbon units support purine and thymidine synthesis, and thus cell growth. Mammals have both cytosolic SHMT1 and mitochondrial SHMT2, with the mitochondrial isozyme strongly up-regulated in cancer. Here we show genetically that dual SHMT1/2 knockout blocks HCT-116 colon cancer tumor xenograft formation. Building from a pyrazolopyran scaffold that inhibits plant SHMT, we identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2 (biochemical IC50 ∼ 10 nM). Metabolomics and isotope tracer studies demonstrate effective cellular target engagement. A cancer cell-line screen revealed that B-cell lines are particularly sensitive to SHMT inhibition. The one-carbon donor formate generally rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor's cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We show that this effect is rooted in defective glycine uptake in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL.","2017","2017 Oct 24","Gregory S Ducker; Jonathan M Ghergurovich; Nello Mainolfi; Vipin Suri; Stephanie K Jeong; Sophia Hsin-Jung Li; Adam Friedman; Mark G Manfredi; Zemer Gitai; Hahn Kim; Joshua D Rabinowitz","Department of Chemistry, Princeton University, Princeton NJ 08544.; Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton NJ 08544.; Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton NJ 08544.; Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton NJ 08544.; Raze Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA 02139.; Raze Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA 02139.; Department of Chemistry, Princeton University, Princeton NJ 08544.; Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton NJ 08544.; Raze Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA 02139.; Raze Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA 02139.; Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton NJ 08544.; Department of Chemistry, Princeton University, Princeton NJ 08544.; Princeton University Small Molecule Screening Center, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544.; Department of Chemistry, Princeton University, Princeton NJ 08544; joshr@princeton.edu.; Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton NJ 08544."

Targeting these two processes can be crucial for cancer progression. Herein, we describe the role of microRNA-661 (miR661) as epigenetic regulator of colon cancer (CC) cell metabolism. MicroR661 induces a global increase in reactive oxygen species, specifically in mitochondrial superoxide anions, which appears to be mediated by decreased carbohydrate metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway, and by a higher dependency on mitochondrial respiration. MicroR661 overexpression in non-metastatic human CC cells induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype, and a reduced tolerance to metabolic stress. This seems to be a general effect of miR661 in CC, since metastatic CC cell metabolism is also compromised upon miR661 overexpression. We propose hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase M2 as two key players related to the observed metabolic reprogramming. Finally, the clinical relevance of miR661 expression levels in stage-II and III CC patients is discussed.

However, it is unknown whether the CBS/H2S axis plays a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Here, we report upregulation of CBS in human biopsies of precancerous adenomatous polyps and show that forced upregulation of CBS in an adenoma-like colonic epithelial cell line is sufficient to induce metabolic and gene expression profiles characteristic of colorectal cancer cells. Differentially expressed metabolites (65 increased and 20 decreased) clustered into the glycolytic pathway, nucleotide sugars, intermediates of the pentose phosphate pathway, and lipogenesis, including primarily phospholipids, sphingolipids, and bile acids. CBS upregulation induced broad changes in the NCM356 cell transcriptome with over 350 differentially expressed genes. These genes overlapped significantly with gene sets related to glycolysis, hypoxia, and a colon cancer cell phenotype, including genes regulated by NF-κB, KRAS, p53, and Wnt signaling, genes downregulated after E-cadherin knockdown, and genes related to increased extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. The CBS-induced switch to an anabolic metabolism was associated with increased NCM356 cell bioenergetics, proliferation, invasion through Matrigel, resistance to anoikis, and CBS-dependent tumorigenesis in immunocompromised mice. Genetic ablation of CBS in CBS heterozygous mice (CBS+/- ) reduced the number of mutagen-induced aberrant colonic crypt foci. Taken together, these results establish that activation of the CBS/H2S axis promotes colon carcinogenesis.

Understanding the metabolic profile of lung metastasis of colorectal cancer is important for developing molecular diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. We carried out the metabonomic profiling of lung tissue samples on a mouse lung metastasis model of colorectal cancer using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR). The lung tissues of mice were collected at different intervals after marine colon cancer cell line CT-26 was intravenously injected into BALB/c mice. The distinguishing metabolites of lung tissue were investigated using 1H-NMR-based metabonomic assay, which is a highly sensitive and non-destructive method for biomarker identification. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were applied to analyze 1H-NMR profiling data to seek potential biomarkers. All of the 3 analyses achieved excellent separations between the normal and metastasis groups. A total of 42 metabolites were identified, ~12 of which were closely correlated with the process of metastasis from colon to lung. These altered metabolites indicated the disturbance of metabolism in metastatic tumors including glycolysis, TCA cycle, glutaminolysis, choline metabolism and serine biosynthesis. Our findings firstly identified the distinguishing metabolites in mouse colorectal cancer lung metastasis models, and indicated that the metabolite disturbance may be associated with the progression of lung metastasis from colon cancer. The altered metabolites may be potential biomarkers that provide a promising molecular approach for clinical diagnosis and mechanistic study of colorectal cancer with lung metastasis.","2017","2017 Nov","Yan Li; Chunting Wang; Dandan Li; Pengchi Deng; Xiaoni Shao; Jing Hu; Chunqi Liu; Hui Jie; Yiyun Lin; Zhuoling Li; Xinying Qian; Huaqin Zhang; Yinglan Zhao","Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics Early Safety Evaluation Model Animals, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R. China.; Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics Early Safety Evaluation Model Animals, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R. China.; Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics Early Safety Evaluation Model Animals, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R. China.; Analytical and Testing Center, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R. China.; Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics Early Safety Evaluation Model Animals, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R. China.; Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics Early Safety Evaluation Model Animals, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R. China.; Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics Early Safety Evaluation Model Animals, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R. China.; Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics Early Safety Evaluation Model Animals, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R. China.; Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics Early Safety Evaluation Model Animals, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R. China.; Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics Early Safety Evaluation Model Animals, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R. China.; Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics Early Safety Evaluation Model Animals, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R. China.; Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics Early Safety Evaluation Model Animals, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R. China.; Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics Early Safety Evaluation Model Animals, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R. China."

Here, we focus on functional differences and individual contribution of acyl coA synthetases (ACSL) isoforms to the previously described ACSL/stearoyl-CoA desaturase (ACSL1/ACSL4/SCD) metabolic network causing invasion and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). ACSL4 fuels proliferation and migration accompanied by a more glycolytic phenotype. Conversely, ACSL1 stimulates invasion displaying a lower basal respiratory rate. Acylcarnitines elevation, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) lower levels, and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) upregulation characterize the individual overexpression of ACSL1, ACSL4 and SCD, respectively. However, the three enzymes simultaneous overexpression results in upregulated phospholipids and urea cycle derived metabolites. Thus, the metabolic effects caused by the network are far from being caused by the individual contributions of each enzyme.

The aim of this work is to deepen in the optimum metabolite extraction protocol from adherent mammalian cells of colon cancer for high throughput metabolomics using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC-MS results showed that metabolic information obtained from colon cancer cells was highly dependent on metabolite extraction selection, which at the same time is extremely influenced by the analytical platform. A further purpose of this investigation is to uncover an unexplored portion of HT-29 colon cancer cells metabolome, complementary to other already explored by CE-MS and LC-MS methods. At this respect, a total of 150 metabolites were identified in HT-29 colon cancer cells by GC-MS. The extraction protocol with acetonitrile-isopropanol-water was the most appropriate for fatty acids and related pathways analysis. Most of the metabolites involved in pathways of amino acids, glutathione, amino sugars and other polar metabolites were better extracted with acidified water, although water extraction showed the best overall reproducibility. Although pathways involving nitrogenous bases could be investigated using organic or aqueous extracts, a higher number of metabolites involved in these pathways were identified in the aqueous extracts. In addition, metabolite extraction protocol was observed to be crucial for the determination of potentially interesting clusters of metabolites.","2017","2017 Sep 15","Clara Ibáñez; Carolina Simó; Mine Palazoglu; Alejandro Cifuentes","Laboratory of Foodomics, CIAL (CSIC), Nicolas Cabrera 9, 28049 Madrid, Spain; IMDEA Food Institute, Ctra.

Whereas immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunoassays are routinely used for clinical analysis of signaling pathways, mass spectrometry-based approaches such as liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MRM-MS) are more commonly used in clinical research. Both technologies have certain disadvantages, namely, the nonspecificity of IHC and immunoassays, and potentially long analysis times per sample of LC/ESI-MRM-MS. To create a robust, fast, and sensitive protein quantification tool, we developed immuno-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (iMALDI) assays with automated liquid handling. The assays are able to quantify AKT1 and AKT2 from breast cancer and colon cancer cell lines and flash-frozen tumor lysates with a linear range of 0.05-2.0 fmol/μg of total lysate protein and with coefficients of variation < 15%. Compared to other mass spectrometric methods, the developed assays require less sample per analysis-only 25 μg of total protein-and are therefore suitable for analysis of needle biopsies. Furthermore, the presented iMALDI technique is the first MS-based method for absolute quantitation of AKT peptides from cancer tissues. This study demonstrates the suitability of iMALDI for low limit-of-detection and reproducible quantitation of signaling pathway members using a benchtop MALDI mass spectrometer within approximately 6-7 h.","2017","2017 Oct 03","Robert Popp; Huiyan Li; André LeBlanc; Yassene Mohammed; Adriana Aguilar-Mahecha; Andrew G Chambers; Cathy Lan; Oliver Poetz; Mark Basik; Gerald Batist; Christoph H Borchers","University of Victoria Genome British Columbia Proteomics Centre, University of Victoria , Victoria, British Columbia V8Z 7X8, Canada.; University of Victoria Genome British Columbia Proteomics Centre, University of Victoria , Victoria, British Columbia V8Z 7X8, Canada.; Segal Cancer Proteomics Centre, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University , 3755 Côte-Sainte-Catherine Road, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1E2, Canada.; University of Victoria Genome British Columbia Proteomics Centre, University of Victoria , Victoria, British Columbia V8Z 7X8, Canada.; Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center , Albinusdreef 2, Leiden, 2333 ZA, The Netherlands.; Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University , 3755 Côte-Sainte-Catherine Road, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1E2, Canada.; University of Victoria Genome British Columbia Proteomics Centre, University of Victoria , Victoria, British Columbia V8Z 7X8, Canada.; Gerald Bronfman Department of Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University , 5100 de Maisonneuve Boulevard West, Suite 720, Montreal, Quebec H4A 3T2, Canada.; Natural and Medical Sciences Institute, University of Tübingen , Markwiesenstrasse 55, Reutlingen 72074, Germany.; Gerald Bronfman Department of Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University , 5100 de Maisonneuve Boulevard West, Suite 720, Montreal, Quebec H4A 3T2, Canada.; Gerald Bronfman Department of Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University , 5100 de Maisonneuve Boulevard West, Suite 720, Montreal, Quebec H4A 3T2, Canada.; University of Victoria Genome British Columbia Proteomics Centre, University of Victoria , Victoria, British Columbia V8Z 7X8, Canada.; Segal Cancer Proteomics Centre, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University , 3755 Côte-Sainte-Catherine Road, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1E2, Canada.; Gerald Bronfman Department of Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University , 5100 de Maisonneuve Boulevard West, Suite 720, Montreal, Quebec H4A 3T2, Canada.; Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Victoria , Petch Building, Room 270d, 3800 Finnerty Road, Victoria, British Columbia, V8P 5C2, Canada."

However, the key metabolic functions of these bacteria remain unclear. We performed a prospective observational study in patients undergoing elective surgery for colon cancer without mechanical bowel preparation (n = 18). Using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing we demonstrated that microbiota ecology appears to be cancer stage-specific and strongly associated with histological features of poor prognosis. Fusobacteria (p < 0.007) and ε- Proteobacteria (p < 0.01) were enriched on tumour when compared to adjacent normal mucosal tissue, and fusobacteria and β-Proteobacteria levels increased with advancing cancer stage (p = 0.014 and 0.002 respecitvely). Metabonomic analysis using 1H Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonsance  (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy, demonstrated increased abundance of taurine, isoglutamine, choline, lactate, phenylalanine and tyrosine and decreased levels of lipids and triglycerides in tumour relative to adjacent healthy tissue. Network analysis revealed that bacteria associated with poor prognostic features were not responsible for the modification of the cancer mucosal metabonome. Thus the colon cancer mucosal microbiome evolves with cancer stage to meet the demands of cancer metabolism. Passenger microbiota may play a role in the maintenance of cancer mucosal metabolic homeostasis but these metabolic functions may not be stage specific.","2017","2017 Aug 21","James Kinross; Reza Mirnezami; James Alexander; Richard Brown; Alasdair Scott; Dieter Galea; Kirill Veselkov; Rob Goldin; Ara Darzi; Jeremy Nicholson; Julian R Marchesi","Division of Surgery, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Division of Surgery, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Division of Digestive Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.; School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Division of Surgery, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Computational and Systems Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Computational and Systems Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Centre for Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Division of Surgery, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Computational and Systems Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Division of Digestive Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK. j.marchesi@imperial.ac.uk.; School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK. j.marchesi@imperial.ac.uk."

Using a cell-based screen to identify small molecules that could selectively kill aneuploid cells, we identified the compound N-[2-hydroxy-1-(4-morpholinylmethyl)-2-phenylethyl]-decanamide monohydrochloride (DL-PDMP), an antagonist of UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase. DL-PDMP selectively inhibited proliferation of aneuploid primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and aneuploid colorectal cancer cells. Its selective cytotoxic effects were based on further accentuating the elevated levels of ceramide, which characterize aneuploid cells, leading to increased apoptosis. We observed that DL-PDMP could also enhance the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel, a standard-of-care chemotherapeutic agent that causes aneuploidy, in human colon cancer and mouse lymphoma cells. Our results offer pharmacologic evidence that the aneuploid state in cancer cells can be targeted selectively for therapeutic purposes, or for reducing the toxicity of taxane-based drug regimens.

In this regard, vesicles secreted by bacteria represent one of the most popular topics for research. For example, the outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) of Bacteroides fragilis play an important nutritional role with respect to other microorganisms and promote anti-inflammatory effects on immune cells. However, toxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF) contributes to bowel disease, even causing colon cancer. If nontoxigenic B. fragilis (NTBF) vesicles exert a beneficial effect on the intestine, it is likely that ETBF vesicles can be utilized for potential pathogenic implementation. To confirm this possibility, we performed comparative proteomic HPLC-MS/MS analysis of vesicles isolated from ETBF and NTBF. Furthermore, we performed, for the first time, HPLC-MS/MS and GS-MS comparative metabolomic analysis for the vesicles isolated from both strains with subsequent reconstruction of the vesicle metabolic pathways. We utilized fluxomic experiments to validate the reconstructed biochemical reaction activities and finally observed considerable difference in the vesicle proteome and metabolome profiles.

However, the relationship between PAK4 and glucose metabolism in cancer cells has not been explored. In this study, we reported that PAK4 promoted glucose intake, NADPH production and lipid biosynthesis, leading to an increased proliferation of colon cancer cells. Mechanistically, PAK4 interacted with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway and increased G6PD activity via enhancing Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination degradation. In addition, we demonstrated a close positive correlation between PAK4 and G6PD expression in colon cancer specimens. Furthermore, expression of PAK4 or G6PD was positively correlated with an aggressive phenotype of clinical colon cancer. These findings revealed a novel glucose metabolism-related mechanism of PAK4 in promoting colon cancer cell growth, suggesting that PAK4 and/or G6PD blockage might be a potential therapeutic strategy for colon cancer.","2017","2017 May 25","Xiumei Zhang; Xia Zhang; Yang Li; Yangguang Shao; Jianying Xiao; Ge Zhu; Feng Li","Department of Cell Biology, Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Ministry of Public Health, and Key Laboratory of Medical Cell Biology, Ministry of Education, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Jinzhou Medical University, Jinzhou, Liaoning, China.; Department of Cell Biology, Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Ministry of Public Health, and Key Laboratory of Medical Cell Biology, Ministry of Education, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.; Department of Cell Biology, Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Ministry of Public Health, and Key Laboratory of Medical Cell Biology, Ministry of Education, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.; Department of Cell Biology, Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Ministry of Public Health, and Key Laboratory of Medical Cell Biology, Ministry of Education, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Jinzhou Medical University, Jinzhou, Liaoning, China.; Department of Cell Biology, Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Ministry of Public Health, and Key Laboratory of Medical Cell Biology, Ministry of Education, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.; Department of Cell Biology, Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Ministry of Public Health, and Key Laboratory of Medical Cell Biology, Ministry of Education, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China."

Here we evaluated the impact of the colonic fatty acid milieu on the formation of prostaglandins and other eicosanoids. Distal tumors in rats were chemically induced to model inflammatory colonic carcinogenesis. After 21 weeks of feeding with either a fish oil diet containing an eicosapentaenoic acid/ω-6 fatty acid ratio of 0.4 or a Western fat diet, the relationships between colon fatty acids and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentrations were evaluated. PGE2 is a key proinflammatory mediator in the colon tightly linked with the initiation and progression of colon cancer. The fish oil vs. the Western fat diet resulted in reduced total fatty acid concentrations in serum but not in colon. In the colon, the effects of the fish oil on fatty acids differed in normal and tumor tissue. There were distinct lipodomic patterns consistent with a lipogenic phenotype in tumors. In tumor tissue, the eicosapentaenoic acid/arachidonic acid ratio, cyclooxygenase-2 expression and the mole percent of saturated fatty acids were significant predictors of inter-animal variability in colon PGE2 after accounting for diet. In normal tissues from either control rats or carcinogen-treated rats, only diet was a significant predictor of colon PGE2. These results show that the fatty acid milieu can modulate the efficacy of dietary fish oils for colon cancer prevention, and this could extend to other preventive agents that function by reducing inflammatory stress.","2017","2017 Aug","Zora Djuric; Muhammad Nadeem Aslam; Becky R Simon; Ananda Sen; Yan Jiang; Jianwei Ren; Rena Chan; Tanu Soni; T M Rajendiran; William L Smith; Dean E Brenner","Department of Family Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.

Therefore, drugs effective for SDHB-deficient tumors could fulfill an unmet medical need. In addition, such drugs would have an advantage in that selection of patients with SDHB-mutant cancer could increase the probability of success in clinical trials. Currently, however, the characteristics of SDHB-deficient cancers are not completely understood. Here, we established SDHB knockout cancer cell lines from human colon cancer HCT116 cells using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 knockout system, and clarified its metabolic characteristics.In the SDHB knockout cells, succinate was accumulated and fumarate was decreased. The oxygen consumption rate was decreased while the extracellular acidification rate was increased in the SDHB knockout cells. Accordingly, an enhanced glycolysis pathway in the SDHB knockout cells was demonstrated by metabolomics analysis. Tracer experiments showed bidirectional metabolic flow in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, possibly to maintain the necessary amounts of metabolites in the SDHB knockout cells. The proliferation of SDHB knockout cells was suppressed by a glycolysis inhibitor but not by a mitochondrial inhibitor. Additionally, partial dependence on glutaminolysis was observed in the SDHB knockout cells. Compound screening revealed that a bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor, which downregulated c-Myc, suppressed the growth of the SDHB knockout cells more potently than that of control cells. These findings provide an understanding of the metabolic characteristics of SDHB-deficient cancer and its vulnerabilities, which may lead to new therapeutic options.","2017","2017 Apr 25","Satoshi Kitazawa; Shunsuke Ebara; Ayumi Ando; Yuji Baba; Yoshinori Satomi; Tomoyoshi Soga; Takahito Hara","Oncology Drug Discovery Unit, Pharmaceutical Research Division, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, 251-8555, Japan.; Oncology Drug Discovery Unit, Pharmaceutical Research Division, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, 251-8555, Japan.; Integrated Technology Research Laboratories, Pharmaceutical Research Division, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, 251-8555, Japan.; Oncology Drug Discovery Unit, Pharmaceutical Research Division, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, 251-8555, Japan.; Integrated Technology Research Laboratories, Pharmaceutical Research Division, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, 251-8555, Japan.; Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, 997-0052, Japan.; Oncology Drug Discovery Unit, Pharmaceutical Research Division, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, 251-8555, Japan."

Here, we hypothesized that UGT1A_i2s function as a complex protein network connecting other metabolic pathways with an influence on cancer cell metabolism. This is based on a pathway enrichment analysis of proteomic data that identified several high-confidence candidate interaction proteins of UGT1A_i2 proteins in human tissues-namely, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis pyruvate kinase (PKM), which plays a critical role in cancer cell metabolism and tumor growth. The partnership of UGT1A_i2 and PKM2 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in the HT115 colon cancer cells and was supported by a partial colocalization of these two proteins. In support of a functional role for this partnership, depletion of UGT1A_i2 proteins in HT115 cells enforced the Warburg effect, with a higher glycolytic rate at the expense of mitochondrial respiration, and led to lactate accumulation. Untargeted metabolomics further revealed a significantly altered cellular content of 58 metabolites, including many intermediates derived from the glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways. These metabolic changes were associated with a greater migration potential. The potential relevance of our observations is supported by the down-regulation of UGT1A_i2 mRNA in colon tumors compared with normal tissues. Alternate UGT1A variants may thus be part of the expanding compendium of metabolic pathways involved in cancer biology directly contributing to the oncogenic phenotype of colon cancer cells. Findings uncover new aspects of UGT functions diverging from their transferase activity.","2017","2017 Mar","Yannick Audet-Delage; Michèle Rouleau; Mélanie Rouleau; Joannie Roberge; Stéphanie Miard; Frédéric Picard; Bernard Têtu; Chantal Guillemette","Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Pharmacy (Y.A.-D., Mi.R., Me.R., J.R., C.G.), Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (S.M., F.P.), and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Medicine (B.T.), Laval University, Québec, Canada.; Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Pharmacy (Y.A.-D., Mi.R., Me.R., J.R., C.G.), Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (S.M., F.P.), and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Medicine (B.T.), Laval University, Québec, Canada.; Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Pharmacy (Y.A.-D., Mi.R., Me.R., J.R., C.G.), Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (S.M., F.P.), and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Medicine (B.T.), Laval University, Québec, Canada.; Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Pharmacy (Y.A.-D., Mi.R., Me.R., J.R., C.G.), Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (S.M., F.P.), and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Medicine (B.T.), Laval University, Québec, Canada.; Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Pharmacy (Y.A.-D., Mi.R., Me.R., J.R., C.G.), Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (S.M., F.P.), and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Medicine (B.T.), Laval University, Québec, Canada.; Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Pharmacy (Y.A.-D., Mi.R., Me.R., J.R., C.G.), Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (S.M., F.P.), and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Medicine (B.T.), Laval University, Québec, Canada.; Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Pharmacy (Y.A.-D., Mi.R., Me.R., J.R., C.G.), Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (S.M., F.P.), and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Medicine (B.T.), Laval University, Québec, Canada.; Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Pharmacy (Y.A.-D., Mi.R., Me.R., J.R., C.G.), Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (S.M., F.P.), and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec Research Center and Faculty of Medicine (B.T.), Laval University, Québec, Canada chantal.guillemette@crchudequebec.ulaval.ca."

Even though the platinum (Pt)-drugs are routinely used clinically, a clear picture of their distribution within tumor tissues is lacking. The current methods to image the distribution of Pt drugs are limited and do not enable the discrimination of the drug from its metabolites. In this manuscript, we demonstrate a methodology that enables chemical imaging of a Pt drug and its metabolites simultaneously and specifically. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) is combined with an on-tissue chemical derivatization using diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC). DDTC abstracts the Pt atom to generate ionizable complexes that can be imaged by MALDI MSI. We demonstrate that Pt drugs and their metabolites can be specifically imaged. This approach was successfully applied to map the penetration and metabolism of oxaliplatin in hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)-like treated 3D colorectal tumor mimics. The distribution of cisplatin and carboplatin was mapped in additional 3D tumor mimics. We demonstrate that the approach can also be used to image the distribution of copper ions in cells. This method has the potential to be used to evaluate the penetration and distribution of a wide range of compounds.","2016","2016 Dec 05","Xin Liu; Amanda B Hummon","Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry Harper Cancer Research Institute University of Notre Dame McCourtney Hall Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA.; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry Harper Cancer Research Institute University of Notre Dame McCourtney Hall Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA."

However, its role in intestinal metabolism has been largely ignored. To investigate this potential aspect of PPARγ function, we submitted intestinal epithelium-specific PPARγ knockout mice (iePPARγKO) to a two-week period of 25% caloric restriction (CR), following which iePPARγKO mice retained more fat than their wild type littermates. In attempting to explain this discrepancy, we analysed the liver, skeletal muscle, intestinal lipid trafficking, and the microbiome, none of which appeared to contribute to the adiposity phenotype. Interestingly, under conditions of CR, iePPARγKO mice failed to activate their sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and increase CR-specific locomotor activity. These KO mice also manifested a defective control of their body temperature, which was overly reduced. Furthermore, the white adipose tissue of iePPARγKO CR mice showed lower levels of both hormone-sensitive lipase, and its phosphorylated form. This would result from impaired SNS signalling and possibly cause reduced lipolysis. We conclude that intestinal epithelium PPARγ plays an essential role in increasing SNS activity under CR conditions, thereby contributing to energy mobilization during metabolically stressful episodes.","2016","2016 Nov 17","Kalina Duszka; Alexandre Picard; Sandrine Ellero-Simatos; Jiapeng Chen; Marianne Defernez; Eeswari Paramalingam; Anna Pigram; Liviu Vanoaica; Cécile Canlet; Paolo Parini; Arjan Narbad; Hervé Guillou; Bernard Thorens; Walter Wahli","Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, The Academia, 20 College Road, 169856, Singapore.; Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Genopode, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.; Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Genopode, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.; Integrative Toxicology and Metabolism, ToxAlim, Research Center in Food Toxicology, National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA), 180 Chemin de Tournefeuille, 31300 Toulouse, France.; Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, The Academia, 20 College Road, 169856, Singapore.; Institute of Food Research, Norwich Science Park, Norwich, Norfolk, NR47UA, UK.; Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, The Academia, 20 College Road, 169856, Singapore.; Institute of Food Research, Norwich Science Park, Norwich, Norfolk, NR47UA, UK.; Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Genopode, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.; INRA, UMR 1331 Toxalim, Research Centre in Food Toxicology, Axiom Platform, 180 chemin de Tournefeuille, 31027 Toulouse Cedex, France.; Toulouse University, INP, Toxalim, UMR 1331, 31027 Toulouse Cedex, France.; MetaToul-MetaboHUB, National Infrastructure of Metabolomics &Fluxomics, 31027 Toulouse Cedex, France.; Department of Laboratory Medicine (LABMED), Division of Clinical Chemistry, and Department of Medicine, Metabolism Unit, Karolinska Institutet at Karolinska Universitetssjukhuset Huddinge, SE-14186, Stockholm, Sweden.; Institute of Food Research, Norwich Science Park, Norwich, Norfolk, NR47UA, UK.; Integrative Toxicology and Metabolism, ToxAlim, Research Center in Food Toxicology, National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA), 180 Chemin de Tournefeuille, 31300 Toulouse, France.; Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, The Academia, 20 College Road, 169856, Singapore.; Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Genopode, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.; Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, The Academia, 20 College Road, 169856, Singapore.; Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Genopode, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.; Integrative Toxicology and Metabolism, ToxAlim, Research Center in Food Toxicology, National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA), 180 Chemin de Tournefeuille, 31300 Toulouse, France."

Our aim was to construct a blood-based biomarker series using a single assay, suitable for CRC detection, prognostication and staging. Serum metabolomic profiles of adenoma (N=31), various stages of CRC (N=320) and healthy matched controls (N=254) were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A diagnostic model for CRC was derived by orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) on a training set, and then validated on an independent data set. Metabolomic models suitable for identifying adenoma, poor prognosis stage II CRC and discriminating various stages were generated. A diagnostic signature for CRC with remarkable multivariate performance (R(2)Y=0.46, Q(2)Y=0.39) was constructed, and then validated (sensitivity 85%; specificity 86%). Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.96). Adenomas were also detectable (R(2)Y=0.35, Q(2)Y=0.26, internal AUROC=0.81, 95% CI, 0.70-0.92). Also of particular interest, we identified models that stratified stage II by prognosis, and classified cases by stage. Using a single assay system, a suite of CRC biomarkers based on circulating metabolites enables early detection, prognostication and preliminary staging information. External population-based studies are required to evaluate the repeatability of our findings and to assess the clinical benefits of these biomarkers.","2016","2016 Sep 27","Farshad Farshidfar; Aalim M Weljie; Karen A Kopciuk; Robert Hilsden; S Elizabeth McGregor; W Donald Buie; Anthony MacLean; Hans J Vogel; Oliver F Bathe","Department of Surgery, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Oncology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Forzani and MacPhail Colon Cancer Screening Centre, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Oncology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Surgery, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Surgery, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Surgery, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Oncology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada."

In addition to its chemopreventive activity, celecoxib can exhibit antimicrobial activity. Differing bacterial profiles have been found in feces from colon cancer patients compared with those of normal subjects. Moreover, preclinical studies suggest that bacteria can modulate intestinal tumorigenesis by secreting specific metabolites. In the current study, we determined whether celecoxib treatment altered the luminal microbiota and metabolome in association with reducing intestinal polyp burden in mice. Administration of celecoxib for 10 weeks markedly reduced intestinal polyp burden in APC(Min/+) mice. Treatment with celecoxib also altered select luminal bacterial populations in both APC(Min/+) and wild-type mice, including decreased Lactobacillaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae as well as increased Coriobacteriaceae Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that celecoxib caused a strong reduction in many fecal metabolites linked to carcinogenesis, including glucose, amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis suggested that these changes in metabolites may contribute to reduced cell proliferation. To this end, we showed that celecoxib reduced cell proliferation in the base of normal appearing ileal and colonic crypts of APC(Min/+) mice. Consistent with this finding, lineage tracing indicated that celecoxib treatment reduced the rate at which Lgr5-positive stem cells gave rise to differentiated cell types in the crypts. Taken together, these results demonstrate that celecoxib alters the luminal microbiota and metabolome along with reducing epithelial cell proliferation in mice. We hypothesize that these actions contribute to its chemopreventive activity.

Its product, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) promotes the growth and proliferation of colorectal tumor cells. In order to improve the antitumor efficacy of the prototypical CBS inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), we have designed and synthesized YD0171, a methyl ester derivative of AOAA. The antiproliferative effect of YD0171 exceeded the antiproliferative potency of AOAA in HCT116 human colon cancer cells. The esterase inhibitor paraoxon prevented the cellular inhibition of CBS activity by YD0171. YD0171 suppressed mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic function and induced G0/G1 arrest, but did not induce tumor cell apoptosis or necrosis. Metabolomic analysis in HCT116 cells showed that YD0171 affects multiple pathways of cell metabolism. The efficacy of YD0171 as an inhibitor of tumor growth was also tested in nude mice bearing subcutaneous HCT116 cancer cell xenografts. Animals were treated via subcutaneous injection of vehicle, AOAA (1, 3 or 9 mg/kg/day) or YD0171 (0.1, 0.5 or 1 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks. Tumor growth was significantly reduced by 9 mg/kg/day AOAA, but not at the lower doses. YD0171 was more potent: tumor volume was significantly inhibited at 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day. Thus, the in vivo efficacy of YD0171 is 9-times higher than that of AOAA. YD0171 (1 mg/kg/day) attenuated tumor growth and metastasis formation in the intracecal HCT116 tumor model. YD0171 (3 mg/kg/day) also reduced tumor growth in patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) bearing athymic mice. YD0171 (3 mg/kg/day) induced the regression of established HCT116 tumors in vivo. A 5-day safety study in mice demonstrated that YD0171 at 20 mg/kg/day (given in two divided doses) does not increase plasma markers of organ injury, nor does it induce histological alterations in the liver or kidney. YD0171 caused a slight elevation in plasma homocysteine levels. In conclusion, the prodrug approach improves the pharmacological profile of AOAA; YD0171 represents a prototype for CBS inhibitory anticancer prodrugs. By targeting colorectal cancer bioenergetics, an emerging important hallmark of cancer, the approach exemplified herein may offer direct translational opportunities.","2016","2016 Sep","Celia Chao; John R Zatarain; Ye Ding; Ciro Coletta; Amy A Mrazek; Nadiya Druzhyna; Paul Johnson; Haiying Chen; Judy L Hellmich; Antonia Asimakopoulou; Kazunori Yanagi; Gabor Olah; Petra Szoleczky; Gabor Törö; Fredrick J Bohanon; Minal Cheema; Rachel Lewis; David Eckelbarger; Akbar Ahmad; Katalin Módis; Ashley Untereiner; Bartosz Szczesny; Andreas Papapetropoulos; Jia Zhou; Mark R Hellmich; Csaba Szabo","Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America"

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous metabolite. Our previous study reveals the plasma ADMA level is elevated in colon cancer patients, which can attenuate serum starvation-induced apoptosis in LoVo cells. In current study, we evaluated the effects of ADMA on gene expression and metabolism in serum-starved LoVo cells with gene microarray and metabolomic approaches. Our results indicated that 96 h serum starvation induced comprehensive alterations at transcriptional level, and most of them were restored by ADMA. The main signaling pathways induced by serum starvation included cancers-related pathways, pathways in cell death, apoptosis, and cell cycle etc. Meanwhile, the metabolomic data showed serum-starved cells were clearly separated with control cells, but not with ADMA-treated cells in PCA model. The identified differential metabolites indicated serum starvation significantly suppressed TCA cycle, altered glucose and fatty acids metabolism, as well as nucleic acids metabolism. However, very few differential metabolites were identified between ADMA and serum-starved cells. In summary, our current results indicated serum starvation profoundly altered the gene expression and metabolism of LoVo cells, whereas ADMA could restore most of the changes at transcriptional level, but not at metabolic level.","2016","2016 May 16","Ningning Zheng; Ke Wang; Jiaojiao He; Yunping Qiu; Guoxiang Xie; Mingming Su; Wei Jia; Houkai Li","Center for Chinese Medical Therapy and Systems Biology, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese MedicineShanghai 201203, China.; Laboratory of Integrative Medicine Surgery, Shuguang Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China.; Center for Chinese Medical Therapy and Systems Biology, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese MedicineShanghai 201203, China.; Stable Isotope and Metabolomics Core Facility, Diabetes Center Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1300 Morris Part Ave, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.; Cancer Epidemiology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813, USA.; Cancer Epidemiology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813, USA.; Center for Chinese Medical Therapy and Systems Biology, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese MedicineShanghai 201203, China.; Cancer Epidemiology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813, USA.; Center for Translational Medicine, and Shanghai Key Laboratory of Diabetes Mellitus, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China.; Center for Chinese Medical Therapy and Systems Biology, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese MedicineShanghai 201203, China."

However, its pharmacological mechanism on tumor cells has not been studied. Herein, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) based metabolomics approach was established to investigate the antitumor effect of flexibilide on HCT-116 cells and its action mechanism. Q-TOF MS and MS/MS were used to identify significantly different metabolites. Comparing flexibilide-treated HCT-116 cells group with control group (dimethyl sulfoxide), 19 distinct metabolites involved in sphingolipid metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism and others were discovered and identified. The significant decrease of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphocholine levels and increase of lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) levels in flexibilide treated cells suggested down-regulation of PC biosynthesis pathway. The decrease of sphingolipids reflected the lesions of cell membrane, and the up-regulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate indicated that TRAF2 and caspase-8 were likely to be activated by flexibilide and further caused cell apoptosis. Furthermore, TCA cycle was deemed to be down-regulated after flexibilide treatment, which might lead to an unsustainable of mitochondrial transmembrane potential MMP). The further measured descreased MMP with the increasing concentration of flexibilide treatment indiciated the dysfunction of mitochondrial which might finally lead to apoptosis. The UPLC/Q-TOF MS based metabolomics approach provides new insights into the mechanistic studies of flexibilide on tumor cells, which benefit its further improvement and application.","2016","2016 Mar 01","Dan Gao; Yini Wang; Weiyi Xie; Ti Yang; Yuyang Jiang; Yuewei Guo; Jin Guan; Hongxia Liu","State Key Laboratory Breeding Base-Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China; Key Laboratory of Metabolomics at Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518055, China.; Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China; Key Laboratory of Metabolomics at Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518055, China.; Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China; Key Laboratory of Metabolomics at Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518055, China.; Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China; Key Laboratory of Metabolomics at Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518055, China.; State Key Laboratory Breeding Base-Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China; School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.; Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.; School of Applied Chemistry, Shenyang Chemical Technology University, Shenyang 110142, China.

Systematic analysis of the IP6 interactome has been performed using the IP6 affinity probe using cytosolic extracts from the LIM1215 colonic carcinoma cell line. LC/MS/MS analysis identified 77 proteins or protein complexes that bind to IP6 specifically, including AP-2 complex proteins and β-arrestins as well as a number of novel potential IP6 interacting proteins.

In contrast, antitumor activity in xenograft tumors is model-dependent, with some solid tumors showing no response to ixazomib. In this study we examined factors responsible for ixazomib sensitivity or resistance using mouse xenograft models. A survey of 14 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 6 colon xenografts showed a striking relationship between ixazomib activity and KRAS genotype; tumors with wild-type (WT) KRAS were more sensitive to ixazomib than tumors harboring KRAS activating mutations. To confirm the association between KRAS genotype and ixazomib sensitivity, we used SW48 isogenic colon cancer cell lines. Either KRAS-G13D or KRAS-G12V mutations were introduced into KRAS-WT SW48 cells to generate cells that stably express activated KRAS. SW48 KRAS WT tumors, but neither SW48-KRAS-G13D tumors nor SW48-KRAS-G12V tumors, were sensitive to ixazomib in vivo. Since activated KRAS is known to be associated with metabolic reprogramming, we compared metabolite profiling of SW48-WT and SW48-KRAS-G13D tumors treated with or without ixazomib. Prior to treatment there were significant metabolic differences between SW48 WT and SW48-KRAS-G13D tumors, reflecting higher oxidative stress and glucose utilization in the KRAS-G13D tumors. Ixazomib treatment resulted in significant metabolic regulation, and some of these changes were specific to KRAS WT tumors. Depletion of free amino acid pools and activation of GCN2-eIF2α-pathways were observed both in tumor types. However, changes in lipid beta oxidation were observed in only the KRAS WT tumors. The non-clinical data presented here show a correlation between KRAS genotype and ixazomib sensitivity in NSCLC and colon xenografts and provide new evidence of regulation of key metabolic pathways by proteasome inhibition.","2015","2015","Nibedita Chattopadhyay; Allison J Berger; Erik Koenig; Bret Bannerman; James Garnsey; Hugues Bernard; Paul Hales; Angel Maldonado Lopez; Yu Yang; Jill Donelan; Kristen Jordan; Stephen Tirrell; Bradley Stringer; Cindy Xia; Greg Hather; Katherine Galvin; Mark Manfredi; Nelson Rhodes; Ben Amidon","Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Metabolon Inc, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."

Changes in gallbladder morphology suggested alterations in bile acid metabolism, as revealed at the molecular level by analysis of the liver, bile, and ileum metabolomes between the vehicle-treated control group and the CPT-11-treated group. Analysis of immune cell populations further showed that CPT-11 treatment significantly decreased the IL-10-producing CD4 T cell frequency in intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes, but not in spleen or mesenteric lymph nodes. In vitro cell culture studies showed that the addition of bile acids deoxycholic acid and taurodeoxycholic acid accelerated the CPT-11-induced suppression of IL-10 secretion by activated CD4(+) naive T cells isolated from mouse splenocytes.

To improve our understanding, longitudinal multi-omic and personalized studies will help to pinpoint combinations of host genetic, epigenetic, microbiota and lifestyle-shaped factors, such as blood factors and metabolites that change as we age. The intestinal holo'ome - defined as the combination of host and microbiota genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes - may be imbalanced and shift to disease when the wrong host gene expression profile meets the wrong microbiota composition. These imbalances can be triggered by the dietary- or lifestyle-shaped intestinal environment. Accordingly, personalized human intestinal holo'omes will differ significantly among individuals and between two critical points in time: long before and upon the onset of disease. Detrimental combinations of factors could therefore be pinpointed computationally and validated using animal models, such as mice and flies. Finally, treatment strategies that break these harmful combinations could be tested in clinical trials. Herein we provide an overview of the literature and a roadmap to this end.","2019","2019 Jun 25","Myrofora Panagi; Konstantina Georgila; Aristides G Eliopoulos; Yiorgos Apidianakis","Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cyprus, Aglatzia, Nicosia, Cyprus.; Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Division of Basic Sciences, University of Crete Medical School, Heraklion, Crete, Greece.; Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Division of Basic Sciences, University of Crete Medical School, Heraklion, Crete, Greece.; Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Forth, Heraklion, Crete, Greece.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cyprus, Aglatzia, Nicosia, Cyprus."

However, little is known about its global metabolic and transcriptional impacts on tumor cells. In current study, we performed a metabolic profiling on human-derived colon cancer LoVo cells treated by 10 mM metformin for 8, 24 and 48 h. An obvious time-dependent metabolic alteration was observed from 8 to 48 h, prior to the reduction of cell viability. A total of 47, 45 and 66 differential metabolites were identified between control and metformin-treated cells at three time points. Most of the metabolites were up-regulated at 8 h, but down-regulated at 24 and 48 h by metformin. These metabolites were mainly involved in carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, vitamins and nucleotides metabolism pathways. Meanwhile, the transcirptomic profile revealed 134 and 3061 differentially expressed genes at 8 and 24 h by metformin. In addition to the cancer signaling pathways, expression of genes involved in cell energy metabolism pathways was significantly altered, which were further validated with genes in glucose metabolism pathway. Altogether, our current data indicate that metformin suppressed the proliferation of LoVo cells, which may be due to the modulation on cell energy metabolism at both metabolic and transcriptional levels in a time-dependent way.","2015","2015 Nov 30","Jiaojiao He; Ke Wang; Ningning Zheng; Yunping Qiu; Guoxiang Xie; Mingming Su; Wei Jia; Houkai Li","Center for Chinese Medical Therapy and Systems Biology, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China.; Laboratory of Integrative Medicine Surgery, Shuguang Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China.; Center for Chinese Medical Therapy and Systems Biology, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China.; Stable Isotope and Metabolomics Core Facility, Diabetes Center Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1300 Morris Part Ave, Bronx, New York, 10461, USA.; Cancer Epidemiology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, Honolulu, Hawaii, 96813, USA.; Cancer Epidemiology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, Honolulu, Hawaii, 96813, USA.; Center for Chinese Medical Therapy and Systems Biology, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China.; Center for Translational Medicine, and Shanghai Key Laboratory of Diabetes Mellitus, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China.; Cancer Epidemiology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, Honolulu, Hawaii, 96813, USA.; Center for Chinese Medical Therapy and Systems Biology, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China.; School of Public Health, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."

As gut microbes influence host immunity and metabolism, we investigated the role of the gut microbiota in the therapeutic management of cancer and associated cachexia. A community-wide analysis of the caecal microbiome in two mouse models of cancer cachexia (acute leukaemia or subcutaneous transplantation of colon cancer cells) identified common microbial signatures, including decreased Lactobacillus spp. and increased Enterobacteriaceae and Parabacteroides goldsteinii/ASF 519. Building on this information, we administered a synbiotic containing inulin-type fructans and live Lactobacillus reuteri 100-23 to leukaemic mice. This treatment restored the Lactobacillus population and reduced the Enterobacteriaceae levels. It also reduced hepatic cancer cell proliferation, muscle wasting and morbidity, and prolonged survival. Administration of the synbiotic was associated with restoration of the expression of antimicrobial proteins controlling intestinal barrier function and gut immunity markers, but did not impact the portal metabolomics imprinting of energy demand. In summary, this study provided evidence that the development of cancer outside the gut can impact intestinal homeostasis and the gut microbial ecosystem and that a synbiotic intervention, by targeting some alterations of the gut microbiota, confers benefits to the host, prolonging survival and reducing cancer proliferation and cachexia.","2016","2016 Jun","Laure B Bindels; Audrey M Neyrinck; Sandrine P Claus; Caroline I Le Roy; Corinne Grangette; Bruno Pot; Inés Martinez; Jens Walter; Patrice D Cani; Nathalie M Delzenne","Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.; Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences, University of Reading, Reading, UK.; Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences, University of Reading, Reading, UK.; Lactic Acid Bacteria and Mucosal Immunity, Centre for Infection and Immunity of Lille, INSERM U1019-CNRS UMR 8204, Institut Pasteur de Lille, Université Lille Nord de France, Lille, France.; Lactic Acid Bacteria and Mucosal Immunity, Centre for Infection and Immunity of Lille, INSERM U1019-CNRS UMR 8204, Institut Pasteur de Lille, Université Lille Nord de France, Lille, France.; Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.; Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.; Walloon Excellence in Life sciences and BIOtechnology (WELBIO), Louvain Drug Research Institute, UCL, Brussels, Belgium.; Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium."

Anti-angiogenesis, anti-invasion were studied by the endothelial cell capillary-like network formation and transmigration through an extracellular matrix. Protein kinase B (PKB, frequently cited as AKT), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation was assayed by cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Comparative global metabolite profiling was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with multivariate statistical analysis, and it was revealed that anthricin was the major compound contributing to the anti-proliferative activity. The activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases played a key role in the apoptotic effect of the methanol extract of CO leaves in HCT116 human colon cancer cells.

Here, we analyzed metabolic changes induced by vitamin C in MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma and HT29 human colon cancer cells using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). The metabolomic profiles of both cell lines were dramatically altered after exposure to cytotoxic concentrations of vitamin C. Levels of upstream metabolites in the glycolysis pathway and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were increased in both cell lines following treatment with vitamin C, while adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and adenylate energy charges were decreased concentration-dependently. Treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) significantly inhibited vitamin C-induced cytotoxicity in MCF7 cells. NAC also suppressed vitamin C-dependent metabolic changes, and NAD treatment prevented vitamin C-induced cell death. Collectively, our data suggests that vitamin C inhibited energy metabolism through NAD depletion, thereby inducing cancer cell death.","2015","2015 Sep 09","Megumi Uetaki; Sho Tabata; Fumie Nakasuka; Tomoyoshi Soga; Masaru Tomita","Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, 246-2 Mizukami, Kakuganji, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-0052, Japan.; Systems Biology Program, Graduate School of Media and Governance, Keio University, 5322 Endo, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0882, Japan.; Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, 246-2 Mizukami, Kakuganji, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-0052, Japan.; Systems Biology Program, Graduate School of Media and Governance, Keio University, 5322 Endo, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0882, Japan.; Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, 246-2 Mizukami, Kakuganji, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-0052, Japan.; Environment and Information Studies, Keio University, 5322 Endo, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0882, Japan.; Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, 246-2 Mizukami, Kakuganji, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-0052, Japan.; Systems Biology Program, Graduate School of Media and Governance, Keio University, 5322 Endo, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0882, Japan.; Environment and Information Studies, Keio University, 5322 Endo, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0882, Japan.; Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, 246-2 Mizukami, Kakuganji, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-0052, Japan.; Systems Biology Program, Graduate School of Media and Governance, Keio University, 5322 Endo, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0882, Japan.; Environment and Information Studies, Keio University, 5322 Endo, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0882, Japan."

Here, we evaluated the antitumoral effect of EMICORON on advanced models of human colon cancer that could adequately predict human clinical outcomes. Our results showed that EMICORON was well tolerated in mice, as no adverse effects were reported, and a low ratio of sensitivity across human and mouse bone marrow cells was observed, indicating a good potential for reaching similar blood levels in humans. Moreover, EMICORON showed a marked therapeutic efficacy, as it inhibited the growth of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and orthotopic colon cancer and strongly reduced the dissemination of tumor cells to lymph nodes, intestine, stomach, and liver. Finally, activation of DNA damage and impairment of proliferation and angiogenesis are proved to be key determinants of EMICORON antitumoral activity.

Recently, ""-omics"" approached have enlightened our knowledge of tumor biology. Such approaches have been extensively implemented in order to provide biomarkers for monitoring of the disease as well as to improve readouts of therapeutic impact. The application of metabolomics to the study of cancer is especially beneficial, since it reflects the biochemical consequences of many cancer type-specific pathophysiological processes. Here, we characterize metabolic profiles of colon and ovarian cancer cell lines to provide broader insight into differentiating metabolic processes for prospective drug development and clinical screening. We applied non-targeted metabolomics-based mass spectroscopy combined with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography for the metabolic phenotyping of four cancer cell lines: two from colon cancer (HCT15, HCT116) and two from ovarian cancer (OVCAR3, SKOV3). We used the MetaP server for statistical data analysis. A total of 225 metabolites were detected in all four cell lines; 67 of these molecules significantly discriminated colon cancer from ovarian cancer cells. Metabolic signatures revealed in our study suggest elevated tricarboxylic acid cycle and lipid metabolism in ovarian cancer cell lines, as well as increased β-oxidation and urea cycle metabolism in colon cancer cell lines. Our study provides a panel of distinct metabolic fingerprints between colon and ovarian cancer cell lines. These may serve as potential drug targets, and now can be evaluated further in primary cells, biofluids, and tissue samples for biomarker purposes.","2015","2015 Jul 14","Anna Halama; Bella S Guerrouahen; Jennifer Pasquier; Ilhem Diboun; Edward D Karoly; Karsten Suhre; Arash Rafii","Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar, Qatar-Foundation, P.O.

Using metabolomics, we investigated the metabolic influence that microbial biofilms have on colon tissues and the related occurrence of cancer. Patient-matched colon cancers and histologically normal tissues, with or without biofilms, were examined. We show the upregulation of polyamine metabolites in tissues from cancer hosts with significant enhancement of N(1), N(12)-diacetylspermine in both biofilm-positive cancer and normal tissues. Antibiotic treatment, which cleared biofilms, decreased N(1), N(12)-diacetylspermine levels to those seen in biofilm-negative tissues, indicating that host cancer and bacterial biofilm structures contribute to the polyamine metabolite pool.

In particular, patients with colon polyps are at higher risk of developing colon cancer; however, noninvasive methods to identify these patients suffer from poor performance. In consideration of the challenges involved in identifying metabolite biomarkers in individuals with high risk for colon cancer, we have investigated NMR-based metabolite profiling in combination with numerous demographic parameters to investigate the ability of serum metabolites to differentiate polyp patients from healthy subjects. We also investigated the effect of disease risk on different groups of biologically related metabolites. A powerful statistical approach, seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), was used to model the correlated levels of metabolites in the same biological group. The metabolites were found to be significantly affected by demographic covariates such as gender, BMI, BMI(2), and smoking status. After accounting for the effects of the confounding factors, we then investigated potential of metabolites from serum to differentiate patients with polyps and age matched healthy controls. Our results showed that while only valine was slightly associated, individually, with polyp patients, a number of biologically related groups of metabolites were significantly associated with polyps. These results may explain some of the challenges and promise a novel avenue for future metabolite profiling methodologies.","2015","2015 Jun 05","Chen Chen; Lingli Deng; Siwei Wei; G A Nagana Gowda; Haiwei Gu; Elena G Chiorean; Mohammad Abu Zaid; Marietta L Harrison; Joseph F Pekny; Patrick J Loehrer; Dabao Zhang; Min Zhang; Daniel Raftery","‡Department of Electronic Science and Communication Engineering, State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian Province 361005, China.; ∥Northwest Metabolomics Research Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98109, United States.; ∥Northwest Metabolomics Research Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98109, United States.; ⊥Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, 535 Barnhill Drive, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, United States.; #Department of Medicine, University of Washington, 825 Eastlake Avenue East, Seattle, Washington 98109, United States.; ⊥Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, 535 Barnhill Drive, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, United States.; ⊥Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, 535 Barnhill Drive, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, United States.; ∥Northwest Metabolomics Research Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98109, United States.; △Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue North, Seattle, Washington 98109, United States."

The feasibility of the whole method for cell metabolomics is demonstrated via a fast and sensitive profiling of the intracellular metabolites HT-29 cells by capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF MS). The suitability of this methodology is further corroborated through the examination of the metabolic changes in the polyamines pathway produced in colon cancer HT-29 cells by difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a known potent ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor.

These uremic toxins, likely generated from the gut microbiota, were associated with an increase in the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and a disorder of lipid metabolism. Nutmeg, which exhibits antimicrobial activity, attenuated the levels of uremic toxins and decreased intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(min/+) mice. Nutmeg-treated Apc(min/+) mice had decreased IL-6 levels and normalized dysregulated lipid metabolism, suggesting that uremic toxins are responsible, in part, for the metabolic disorders that occur during tumorigenesis.

Many studies have profiled free amino acids (FAAs) or proteins; however, few have connected the measurement of FAA with individual amino acids in the proteome. In this study, we developed a metabolomics method to comprehensively analyze amino acids in different domains, using two examples of different sample types and disease models. We first examined the responses of FAAs and insoluble-proteome amino acids (IPAAs) to the Myc oncogene in Tet21N human neuroblastoma cells. The metabolic and proteomic amino acid profiles were quite different, even under the same Myc condition, and their combination provided a better understanding of the biological status. In addition, amino acids were measured in 3 domains (FAAs, free and soluble-proteome amino acids (FSPAAs), and IPAAs) to study changes in serum amino acid profiles related to colon cancer. A penalized logistic regression model based on the amino acids from the three domains had better sensitivity and specificity than that from each individual domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform a combined analysis of amino acids in different domains, and indicates the useful biological information available from a metabolomics analysis of the protein pellet. This study lays the foundation for further quantitative tracking of the distribution of amino acids in different domains, with opportunities for better diagnosis and mechanistic studies of various diseases.","2015","2015 Apr 21","Haiwei Gu; Jianhai Du; Fausto Carnevale Neto; Patrick A Carroll; Sally J Turner; E Gabriela Chiorean; Robert N Eisenman; Daniel Raftery","Northwest Metabolomics Research Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of Washington, 850 Republican St., Seattle, WA 98109, USA."

Although antimicrobial peptides have potential use in the development of new therapeutic strategies, their effects on the metabolism of cancer cells are poorly understood. Here, we investigated changes in the levels of metabolites in HCT116 cells caused by FF/CAP18, via capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). Analysis of the 177 intracellular metabolites and 113 metabolites in conditioned medium that were detected by CE-TOFMS, revealed dramatic changes in the metabolic profile of HCT116 cells after treatment with FF/CAP18. The metabolic profile showed that the levels of most metabolites in the major metabolic pathways supported the rapid proliferation of cancer cells. Purine metabolism, glycolysis, and the TCA cycle, were altered in FF/CAP18-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner.

This study aimed to reveal effects of CD44 silencing on alterations in energy metabolism and sulfur-containing metabolites in vitro and in vivo using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry and quantitative imaging mass spectrometry (Q-IMS), respectively. In an experimental model of xenograft transplantation of human colon cancer HCT116 cells in superimmunodeficient NOG mice, snap-frozen liver tissues containing metastatic tumors were examined by Q-IMS. As reported previously, short hairpin CD44 RNA interference (shCD44) in cancer cells caused significant regression of tumor growth in the host liver. Under these circumstances, the CD44 knockdown suppressed polyamines, GSH and energy charges not only in metastatic tumors but also in the host liver. In culture, HCT116 cells treated with shCD44 decreased total amounts of methionine-pool metabolites including spermidine and spermine, and reactive cysteine persulfides, suggesting roles of these metabolites for cancer growth. Collectively, these results suggest that CD44 expressed in cancer accounts for a key regulator of metabolic interplay between tumor and the host tissue.","2015","2015 Apr 30","Mitsuyo Ohmura; Takako Hishiki; Takehiro Yamamoto; Tsuyoshi Nakanishi; Akiko Kubo; Kenji Tsuchihashi; Mayumi Tamada; Sakino Toue; Yasuaki Kabe; Hideyuki Saya; Makoto Suematsu","Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan; MS Business Unit, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto 604-8511, Japan.; Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan; Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.; Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan; Japan Science and Technology Agency, Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, Suematsu Gas Biology Project, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan; Japan Science and Technology Agency, Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, Suematsu Gas Biology Project, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.

Colorectal carcinoma is the third cause of cancer deaths in the world. For diagnosis, invasive methods like colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy are used, and noninvasive screening tests are not very accurate. We decided to study the potential of (1)HNMR spectroscopy with metabolomics and chemometrics as a preliminary noninvasive test. We obtained a distinguishing pattern of metabolites and metabolic pathways between colon cancer patient and normal. Methods. Sera were obtained from confirmed colon cancer patients and the same number of healthy controls. Samples were sent for (1)HNMR spectroscopy and analysis was carried out Chenomex and MATLAB software. Metabolites were identified using Human Metabolic Data Base (HDMB) and the main metabolic cycles were identified using Metaboanalyst software. Results. 15 metabolites were identified such as pyridoxine, orotidine, and taurocholic acid. Main metabolic cycles involved were the bile acid biosynthesis, vitamin B6 metabolism, methane metabolism, and glutathione metabolism. Discussion.

The Foodomics study reveals that CA induces transcriptional activation of genes that encode detoxifying enzymes and altered the expression of genes linked to transport and biosynthesis of terpenoids in the colon cancer cell line. Functional analysis highlighted the activation of the ROS metabolism and alteration of several genes involved in pathways describing oxidative degradation of relevant endogenous metabolites, providing new evidence about the transcriptional change induced by CA in HT-29 cells. Metabolomics analysis showed that the treatment with CA affected the intracellular levels of glutathione. Elevated levels of GSH provided additional evidence to transcriptomic results regarding chemopreventive response of cells to CA treatment. Moreover, the Foodomics approach was useful to establish the links between decreased levels of N-acetylputrescine and its degradation pathway at the gene level. The findings from this work and the predictions based on microarray data will help explore novel metabolic processes and potential signaling pathways to further elucidate the effect of CA in colon cancer cells.","2014","2014 Oct 07","Alberto Valdés; Virginia García-Cañas; Carolina Simó; Clara Ibáñez; Vicente Micol; Jose A Ferragut; Alejandro Cifuentes","Laboratory of Foodomics, Institute of Food Science Research (CIAL), CSIC , Nicolas Cabrera 9, Campus de Cantoblanco, 28049 Madrid, Spain."

Fibroblasts represent the most abundant stromal constituents. Here, we established two pairs of normal fibroblast (NF) and cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) cultures from colorectal adenocarcinoma tissues and the normal counterparts. The NFs and CAFs were stained positive for typical fibroblast markers and inhibited colon cancer (CC) cell proliferation in in vitro cocultures and in xenograft mouse models. The fibroblast conditioned media were analyzed using LC-MS and 227 proteins were identified at a false discovery rate of 1.3%, including 131 putative secretory and 20 plasma membrane proteins. These proteins were enriched for functional categories of extracellular matrix, adhesion, cell motion, inflammatory response, redox homeostasis and peptidase inhibitor. Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, transgelin, follistatin-related protein 1 (FSTL1) and decorin was abundant in the fibroblast secretome as confirmed by Western blot. Silencing of FSTL1 and transgelin in colonic fibroblast cell line CCD-18Co induced an accelerated proliferation of CC cells in cocultures. Exogenous FSTL1 attenuates CC cell proliferation in a negative fashion. FSTL1 was upregulated in CC patient plasma and cancerous tissues but had no implication in prognosis. Our results provided novel insights into the molecular signatures and modulatory role of CC associated fibroblasts. In this study, a label-free LC-MS was performed to analyze the secretomes of two paired primary fibroblasts, which were isolated from fresh surgical specimen of colorectal adenocarcinoma and adjacent normal colonic tissues and exhibited negative modulatory activity for colon cancer cell growth in in vitro cocultures and in vivo xenograph mouse models. Follistatin-related protein 1 was further revealed to be one of the stroma-derived factors of potential suppression role for colon cancer cell proliferation.

It is tightly linked with cell proliferation in liver and colon cancer. In humans, there are three genes, mat1A, mat2A and mat2B, which encode MAT enzymes. mat2A and mat2B transcribe MATα2 and MATβ enzyme subunits, respectively, with catalytic and regulatory roles. The MATα2β complex is expressed in nearly all tissues and is thought to be essential in providing the necessary SAMe flux for methylation of DNA and various proteins including histones. In human hepatocellular carcinoma mat2A and mat2B genes are upregulated, highlighting the importance of the MATα2β complex in liver disease. The individual subunits have been structurally characterized but the nature of the complex has remained elusive despite its existence having been postulated for more than 20 years and the observation that MATβ is often co-localized with MATα2. Though SAMe can be produced by MAT(α2)4 alone, this paper shows that the V max of the MATα2β complex is three- to fourfold higher depending on the variants of MATβ that participate in complex formation. Using X-ray crystallography and solution X-ray scattering, the first structures are provided of this 258 kDa functional complex both in crystals and solution with an unexpected stoichiometry of 4α2 and 2βV2 subunits. It is demonstrated that the N-terminal regulates the activity of the complex and it is shown that complex formation takes place surprisingly via the C-terminal of MATβV2 that buries itself in a tunnel created at the interface of the MAT(α2)2. The structural data suggest a unique mechanism of regulation and provide a gateway for structure-based drug design in anticancer therapies.","2014","2014 Jul 01","Ben Murray; Svetlana V Antonyuk; Alberto Marina; Sebastiaan M Van Liempd; Shelly C Lu; Jose M Mato; S Samar Hasnain; Adriana L Rojas","Molecular Biophysics Group, Institute of Integrative Biology, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of Liverpool, L69 7ZX, England ; Structural Biology Unit CIC bioGUNE, Parque Tecnológico de Bizkaia, 48160 Derio, Bizkaia, Spain.; Molecular Biophysics Group, Institute of Integrative Biology, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of Liverpool, L69 7ZX, England.; Structural Biology Unit CIC bioGUNE, Parque Tecnológico de Bizkaia, 48160 Derio, Bizkaia, Spain.; Metabolomics Unit, CIC bioGUNE, CIBERehd, Parque Tecnológico de Bizkaia, 48160 Derio, Bizkaia, Spain.; Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, USC Research Center for Liver Diseases, USC-UCLA Research Center for ALPD and Cirrhosis, Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, CA 90033, USA.; Metabolomics Unit, CIC bioGUNE, CIBERehd, Parque Tecnológico de Bizkaia, 48160 Derio, Bizkaia, Spain.; Molecular Biophysics Group, Institute of Integrative Biology, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of Liverpool, L69 7ZX, England.; Structural Biology Unit CIC bioGUNE, Parque Tecnológico de Bizkaia, 48160 Derio, Bizkaia, Spain."

Principal components analysis and discriminant analysis was performed to select low-mass ions with strong discriminating power between 5-florouracil resistant and parental cells. The correlation between the intensities of low-mass ions and intrinsic 5-florouracil resistance in 11 colon cancer cells was analyzed using the Spearman rank coefficient. Eleven low-mass ions had strong discrimi-nating power between 5-florouracil-resistant and parental cells. Of these, the intensity of a low-mass ion with 256.29 m/z was negatively correlated with intrinsic 5-florouracil resistance in 11 colon cancer cells (r = -0.6545, P = 0.0338). By searching the H+ adduct with 0.05 m/z tolerance in the Human Metabolome Database, a low-mass ion of 256.29 m/z was identified as palmitic amide. Interestingly, extracellular treatment with palmitic amide reduced 5-florouracil resistance and invasiveness in 5-florouracil-resistant cells.

However, it is not clear if those factors can affect colorectal cancer treatment, recurrence, survival and quality of life. This paper describes the background and design of the ""COlorectal cancer: Longitudinal, Observational study on Nutritional and lifestyle factors that may influence colorectal tumour recurrence, survival and quality of life"" - COLON - study. The main aim of this study is to assess associations of diet and other lifestyle factors, with colorectal cancer recurrence, survival and quality of life. We extensively investigate diet and lifestyle of colorectal cancer patients at diagnosis and during the following years; this design paper focusses on the initial exposures of interest: diet and dietary supplement use, body composition, nutrient status (e.g. vitamin D), and composition of the gut microbiota. The COLON study is a multi-centre prospective cohort study among at least 1,000 incident colorectal cancer patients recruited from 11 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients with colorectal cancer are invited upon diagnosis. Upon recruitment, after 6 months, 2 years and 5 years, patients fill out food-frequency questionnaires; questionnaires about dietary supplement use, physical activity, weight, height, and quality of life; and donate blood samples. Diagnostic CT-scans are collected to assess cross-sectional areas of skeletal muscle, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat and intermuscular fat, and to assess muscle attenuation. Blood samples are biobanked to facilitate future analyse of biomarkers, nutrients, DNA etc. Analysis of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels, and analysis of metabolomic profiles are scheduled. A subgroup of patients with colon cancer is asked to provide faecal samples before and at several time points after colon resection to study changes in gut microbiota during treatment. For all patients, information on vital status is retrieved by linkage with national registries. Information on clinical characteristics is gathered from linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry and with hospital databases. Hazards ratios will be calculated for dietary and lifestyle factors at diagnosis in relation to recurrence and survival. Repeated measures analyses will be performed to assess changes over time in dietary and other factors in relation to recurrence and survival.","2014","2014 May 27","Renate M Winkels; Renate C Heine-Bröring; Moniek van Zutphen; Suzanne van Harten-Gerritsen; Dieuwertje E G Kok; Fränzel J B van Duijnhoven; Ellen Kampman","Division of Human Nutrition, Wageningen University, Wageningen, The Netherlands. renate.winkels@wur.nl."

However, fecal-based methods identify patients with adenomatous polyps with low levels of sensitivity. The aim or this study was to develop a highly accurate, prototypic, proof-of-concept, spot urine-based diagnostic test using metabolomic technology to distinguish persons with adenomatous polyps from those without polyps. Prospective urine and stool samples were collected from 876 participants undergoing colonoscopy examination in a colon cancer screening program, from April 2008 to October 2009 at the University of Alberta. Colonoscopy reference standard identified 633 participants with no colonic polyps and 243 with colonic adenomatous polyps. One-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of urine metabolites were analyzed to define a diagnostic metabolomic profile for colonic adenomas. A urine metabolomic diagnostic test for colonic adenomatous polyps was established using 67% of the samples (un-blinded training set) and validated using the other 33% of the samples (blinded testing set). The urine metabolomic diagnostic test's specificity and sensitivity were compared with those of fecal-based tests. Using a two-component, orthogonal, partial least-squares model of the metabolomic profile, the un-blinded training set identified patients with colonic adenomatous polyps with 88.9% sensitivity and 50.2% specificity. Validation using the blinded testing set confirmed sensitivity and specificity values of 82.7% and 51.2%, respectively. Sensitivities of fecal-based tests to identify colonic adenomas ranged from 2.5 to 11.9%.

The different isoforms regulate stem-cell renewal and differentiation as well as cell senescence. Several studies indicate that p63 isoforms also play a role in cancer development; however, very little is known about the role played by p63 in regulating the cancer stem phenotype. Here we investigate the cellular signals regulated by TAp63 and ΔNp63 in a model of epithelial cancer stem cells. To this end, we used colon cancer stem cells, overexpressing either TAp63 or ΔNp63 isoforms, to carry out a proteomic study by chemical-labeling approach coupled to network analysis. Our results indicate that p63 is implicated in a wide range of biological processes, including metabolism. This was further investigated by a targeted strategy at both protein and metabolite levels. The overall data show that TAp63 overexpressing cells are more glycolytic-active than ΔNp63 cells, indicating that the two isoforms may regulate the key steps of glycolysis in an opposite manner.

The effects of β-catenin activity on metabolic profiles were assessed in mice with colon-specific disruption of Apc. Thirteen markers were found in urine associated with development of colorectal tumors in Apc(Min/+) mice. Metabolites related to polyamine metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism, and methylation, identified tumor-bearing mice with 100% accuracy, and also accurately identified mice with polyps. Changes in gene expression in tumor samples from mice revealed that derangement of metabolites were a reflection of coordinate metabolic reprogramming in tumor tissue. Similar changes in urinary metabolites were observed in mice with azoxymethane-induced tumors and in mice with colon-specific activation of β-catenin. The metabolic alterations indicated by markers in urine, therefore, appear to occur during early stages of tumorigenesis, when cancer cells are proliferating. In tissues from patients, tumors had stage-dependent increases in 17 metabolites associated with the same metabolic pathways identified in mice. Ten metabolites that were increased in tumor tissues, compared with nontumor tissues (proline, threonine, glutamic acid, arginine, N1-acetylspermidine, xanthine, uracil, betaine, symmetric dimethylarginine, and asymmetric-dimethylarginine), were also increased in urine from tumor-bearing mice. Gene expression and metabolomic profiles of urine and tissue samples from mice with colorectal tumors and of colorectal tumor samples from patients revealed pathways associated with derangement of specific metabolic pathways that are indicative of early-stage tumor development.

Multivariate data analysis revealed significant differences between tumor and corresponding control tissues. Main discriminators were obtained, which represent the overall alteration in glycosylation of glycosphingolipids during colorectal cancer progression, and these were found to be characterized by (1) increased fucosylation, (2) decreased acetylation, (3) decreased sulfation, (4) reduced expression of globo-type glycans, as well as (5) disialyl gangliosides. The findings of our current research confirm former reports, and in addition expand the knowledge of glycosphingolipid glycosylation in colorectal cancer by revealing new glycans with discriminative power and characteristic, cancer-associated glycosylation alterations. The obtained discriminating glycans can contribute to progress the discovery of biomarkers to improve diagnostics and patient treatment.","2013","2013 Nov","Stephanie Holst; Kathrin Stavenhagen; Crina I A Balog; Carolien A M Koeleman; Liam M McDonnell; Oleg A Mayboroda; Aswin Verhoeven; Wilma E Mesker; Rob A E M Tollenaar; André M Deelder; Manfred Wuhrer","Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands;"

Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is an oncosuppressor that, following its activation by several cellular stress, induces cancer cell death via p53-dependent or -independent pathways. Here, we used genetically matched human RKO colon cancer cells harboring wt-HIPK2 (HIPK2(+/+)) or stable HIPK2 siRNA interference (siHIPK2) to investigate in vitro whether HIPK2 influenced cell death in glucose restriction. We found that glucose starvation induced cell death, mainly due to c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation, in HIPK2(+/+)cells compared with siHIPK2 cells that did not die. (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance quantitative metabolic analyses showed a marked glycolytic activation in siHIPK2 cells. However, treatment with glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose induced cell death only in HIPK2(+/+) cells but not in siHIPK2 cells. Similarly, siGlut-1 interference did not re-establish siHIPK2 cell death under glucose restriction, whereas marked cell death was reached only after zinc supplementation, a condition known to reactivate misfolded p53 and inhibit the pseudohypoxic phenotype in this setting. Further siHIPK2 cell death was reached with zinc in combination with autophagy inhibitor. We propose that the metabolic changes acquired by cells after HIPK2 silencing may contribute to induce resistance to cell death in glucose restriction condition, and therefore be directly relevant for tumor progression. Moreover, elimination of such a tolerance might serve as a new strategy for cancer therapy.","2013","2013 May 23","A Garufi; A Ricci; D Trisciuoglio; E Iorio; G Carpinelli; G Pistritto; M Cirone; G D'Orazi","Molecular Oncogenesis Laboratory, Department of Experimental Oncology, Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy."

In this regard, maslinic acid (MA), a pentacyclic triterpene extracted from wax-like coatings of olives, is known to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines without affecting normal intestinal cells. The present study evaluated the chemopreventive efficacy and associated mechanisms of maslinic acid treatment on spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice. Twenty-two mice were randomized into 2 groups: control group and MA group, fed with a maslinic acid-supplemented diet for six weeks. MA treatment reduced total intestinal polyp formation by 45% (P<0.01). Putative molecular mechanisms associated with suppressing intestinal polyposis in Apc(Min/+) mice were investigated by comparing microarray expression profiles of MA-treated and control mice and by analyzing the serum metabolic profile using NMR techniques. The different expression phenotype induced by MA suggested that it exerts its chemopreventive action mainly by inhibiting cell-survival signaling and inflammation. These changes eventually induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, the metabolic changes induced by MA treatment were associated with a protective profile against intestinal tumorigenesis. These results show the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of MA against intestinal tumor development in the Apc(Min/+) mice model, suggesting its chemopreventive potential against colorectal cancer.","2013","2013","Susana Sánchez-Tena; Fernando J Reyes-Zurita; Santiago Díaz-Moralli; Maria Pilar Vinardell; Michelle Reed; Francisco García-García; Joaquín Dopazo; José A Lupiáñez; Ulrich Günther; Marta Cascante","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."

Diet is known to play an important role in the etiology of colon cancer and dietary chemoprevention is receiving increasing attention for prevention and/or alternative treatment of colon cancers. Allium fistulosum L., commonly known as scallion, is popularly used as a spice or vegetable worldwide, and as a traditional medicine in Asian cultures for treating a variety of diseases. In this study we evaluated the possible beneficial effects of dietary scallion on chemoprevention of colon cancer using a mouse model of colon carcinoma (CT-26 cells subcutaneously inoculated into BALB/c mice). Tumor lysates were subjected to western blotting for analysis of key inflammatory markers, ELISA for analysis of cytokines, and immunohistochemistry for analysis of inflammatory markers. Metabolite profiles of scallion extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Scallion extracts, particularly hot-water extract, orally fed to mice at 50 mg (dry weight)/kg body weight resulted in significant suppression of tumor growth and enhanced the survival rate of test mice. At the molecular level, scallion extracts inhibited the key inflammatory markers COX-2 and iNOS, and suppressed the expression of various cellular markers known to be involved in tumor apoptosis (apoptosis index), proliferation (cyclin D1 and c-Myc), angiogenesis (VEGF and HIF-1α), and tumor invasion (MMP-9 and ICAM-1) when compared with vehicle control-treated mice.

The subsequent fermentation metabolomes were applied on colon cancer cells, and the gene expression changes studied. Polydextrose fermentation down-regulated gene ontology classes linked with cell cycle, and affected number of metabolically active cells. Furthermore, up-regulated effects on classes linked with apoptosis, with increased caspase 2 and 3 activity, implicate that polydextrose fermentation plays a role in induction of apoptosis in colon cancer cells. The up-regulated genes involved also key regulators of lipid metabolism, such as PPARα and PGC-1α.

Indeed, increments in the serum levels of triglycerides (TG) and cholesterols are positively related with colon carcinogenesis. We previously reported that an age-dependent hyperlipidemic state is characteristic of Min mice, an animal model for human familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). However, qualitative and quantitative changes of lipid metabolism are poorly understood in this state. Here, we provide detailed analysis of serum lipids in Min mice using reverse-phased liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RPLC/ESI-MS). We also demonstrate local analysis of lipid droplets in the villi of the small intestine using laser capture microdissection and a sensitive chip-based nanoESI-MS system. As a result, oxidized phosphatidylcholines (PC) such as aldehyde and carboxylic acid types were increased, even at an early stage of intestinal polyp formation in serum. In addition, hydroperoxidizable TG precursors containing linoleic acid (18:2n-6) were deposited at the tip of the villi with aging, and these hydroperoxidized TG were also increased in serum. Meanwhile, increments of the oxidizable TG precursors in serum and small intestinal mucosa were suppressed by treatment with pitavastatin, a novel third generation lipophilic statin. These results suggest that quantitative and qualitative lipid changes such as hydroperoxidizable TG precursors are important in the course of intestinal polyp formation and oxidative stress might lead to the development of intestinal polyp formation in Min mice.","2011","2011 Jan","Kazutaka Ikeda; Michihiro Mutoh; Naoya Teraoka; Hiroki Nakanishi; Keiji Wakabayashi; Ryo Taguchi","Department of Metabolome, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."

This process is regulated by the acetylation state of histones. Removal of the acetyl groups of histones by specific enzymes (histone deacetylases, HDAC) usually downregulates expression of genes that can cause cells to differentiate, and pharmacological inhibitors of these enzymes have been shown to induce differentiation in several colon cancer cell lines. Butyrate at high (mM) concentration is both a precursor for acetyl-CoA and a known HDAC inhibitor that induces cell differentiation in colon cells. The dual role of butyrate raises the question whether its effects on HT29 cell differentiation are due to butyrate metabolism or to its HDAC inhibitor activity. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used a tracer-based metabolomics approach to compare the metabolic changes induced by two different types of HDAC inhibitors (butyrate and the non-metabolic agent trichostatin A) and those induced by other acetyl-CoA precursors that do not inhibit HDAC (caprylic and capric acids). [1,2-(13)C(2)]-d-glucose was used as a tracer and its redistribution among metabolic intermediates was measured to estimate the contribution of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the Krebs cycle to the metabolic profile of HT29 cells under the different treatments. The results demonstrate that both HDAC inhibitors (trichostatin A and butyrate) induce a common metabolic profile that is associated with histone deacetylase inhibition and differentiation of HT29 cells whereas the metabolic effects of acetyl-CoA precursors are different from those of butyrate. The experimental findings support the concept of crosstalk between metabolic and cell signalling events, and provide an experimental approach for the rational design of new combined therapies that exploit the potential synergism between metabolic adaptation and cell differentiation processes through modification of HDAC activity.","2010","2010 Jun","Gema Alcarraz-Vizán; Joan Boren; Wai-Nang Paul Lee; Marta Cascante",""

Such chronic diseases are likely to have an environmental origin. However, ""environmental"" risks have been often elusive in epidemiological studies. This is a conundrum for current epidemiological research. On the other side, the relative contribution of genes to chronic diseases, as emerging from GWAS, seems to be modest (15-50% increase in disease risk). What is yet to be explored extensively is a model of disease based on long-term effects of low doses of environmental exposures, incorporating both genetic and acquired susceptibility (""clinical vulnerability""), and the cumulative effects of different exposures. Such a disease model would be compatible with the weak associations found by GWAS and the still elusive role of many (low-level) environmental exposures.

In particular, the polyamine catabolic enzyme SSAT (spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase) seems to have different roles in tumorigenesis, depending upon the particular system being analysed. In attempts to clarify the function of SSAT in tumour development, we have utilized the Apc(Min/+) mouse, which carries a mutant allele of the Apc (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene, rendering it susceptible to the formation of multiple adenomas in the small intestine and colon. Using genetically engineered animals (i.e. transgenic and knockout mice), we have shown that SSAT acts as a tumour promoter in the Apc(Min/+) model. Modulation of tumorigenesis is not associated with changes in tissue levels of either spermidine or spermine. These findings, along with those made in other animal models of cancer, have prompted us to propose that metabolic flux through the polyamine biosynthetic and catabolic pathways, and the consequent changes in levels of various metabolites within the cell (i.e. the metabolome), is critical to tumour development.

Colorectal cancer represents an ideal model system to study the development and progression of human tumors, and the proteomic approach avoids overlooking posttranslational modifications not detected by microarray analyses and the limited correlation between transcript and protein levels. Colon cancer samples, confined to the intestinal wall, were analyzed by expression proteomics and compared with matched samples from normal colon tissue. Samples were processed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and spots differentially expressed and consistent across all patients were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses and by Western blot analyses. After differentially expressed proteins and their metabolic pathways were analyzed, the following main conclusions were achieved for tumor tissue: 1) a shift from beta-oxidation, as the main source of energy, to anaerobic glycolysis was observed owed to the alteration of nuclear- versus mitochondrial-encoded proteins and other proteins related to fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism; 2) lower capacity for Na(+) and K(+) cycling; and 3) operativity of the apoptosis pathway, especially the mitochondrial one. This study of the human colon cancer proteome represents a step toward a better understanding of the metabolomics of colon cancer at early stages confined to the intestinal wall.","2006","2006 Jun","Roberto Mazzanti; Michela Solazzo; Ornella Fantappié; Sarah Elfering; Pietro Pantaleo; Paolo Bechi; Fabio Cianchi; Adam Ettl; Cecilia Giulivi","Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Duluth, USA."

Variation in cancer incidence among and within populations with similar dietary patterns suggests that an individual's response may reflect interactions with genetic factors, which may modify gene, protein, and metabolite expression patterns. Nutrigenomics, defined as the interaction between nutrition and an individual's genome, will likely provide important clues about responders and nonresponders. In this symposium, the role of bioactive food components in colon cancer susceptibility was used to exemplify the application of ""omic"" technologies for cancer prevention. Topics that were addressed included dietary changes and gene polymorphisms (nutrigenetics), DNA methylation (nutritional epigenomics), gene expression (nutritional transcriptomics), altered formation or bioactivation of proteins (proteomics), and characterizing how the quantity and timing of exposure influence small molecular weight cellular constituents (metabolomics). The final presentation focused on exfoliated cells as a surrogate sample for the evaluation of bioactive food components in cancer prevention. The goal of the symposium was to provide an example of each of the ""omic"" technologies as they relate to nutrition, cancer risk, and tumor behavior, and to help the participants understand that an integrated framework that simultaneously examines all of the ""omic"" technologies is needed.","2005","2005 Nov","Cindy D Davis; Norman G Hord","Nutritional Sciences Research Group, NCI/National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20892-7328, USA. davisci@mail.nih.gov"
