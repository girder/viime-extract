"1","40639496","Global transcriptome characterization of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in individuals with chronic HIV infection.","Genomics","","HIV-1; Metabolism; Mitochondrion; Purine metabolism","Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), resulting from Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, is one of the most severe infectious diseases worldwide. The current state of prevention and control remains critical. Recent studies have increasingly highlighted the significant role of cellular metabolism in regulating immune responses and managing infections. However, whether distinct immunometabolic profiles exist among different groups infected with HIV remains to be investigated. In this study, we employed RNA-seq technology to explore the differential characterization of immune metabolism across various HIV infections. To investigate the metabolic differences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-infected populations, we obtained PBMCs from 18 individuals diagnosed with HIV. This cohort included four Immune Responders (IRs), five Immune Non-Responders (INRs), five typical progressors (TPs) who maintained high viral loads, and four Elite Controllers (ECs) who sustained low levels of viral replication without treatment. We conducted single-cell sequencing on the PBMCs derived from these patients and compared the results between IRs and INRs, as well as ECs and TPs. Our findings revealed significant metabolic dysregulation and altered inflammatory states in INRs compared to IRs. These alterations were primarily observed in purine metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis pathways, as well as modifications in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism pathways. Furthermore, we identified variations within a subset of CD8+ T-cell populations characterized by high expression of GNLY, which predominantly exerts cytotoxic effects. Differences in metabolic pathways were also noted between ECs and TPs; however, these changes mainly focused on OXPHOS and pentose phosphate pathways while no significant differences were observed in glycolysis pathway.","2025","2025 Jul 08","Han-Ying Wang; Xi Wang; Qian-Qian Zhang; Xing-Zhong Miao; Liang-Juan Chen; Li-Jun Sun; Hong-Bo Shi","Beijing Key Laboratory for Research on Liver Regeneration and Artificial Liver Transformation, Fourth Department of Liver Disease, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Clinic of Center for Infection, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; University of Science and Technology Beijing, School of Chemistry and Biological Engineering, China.; Beijing Key Laboratory for Research on Liver Regeneration and Artificial Liver Transformation, Fourth Department of Liver Disease, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Beijing Key Laboratory for Research on Liver Regeneration and Artificial Liver Transformation, Fourth Department of Liver Disease, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Clinic of Center for Infection, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Chinese Association of STD and AIDS Prevention and Control, Beijing, China.

"2","40637373","Novel insights into immune checkpoints in HIV/SHIV infection: from SHIVSF162P3-infected elite controllers to therapeutic strategy.","Journal of virology","","HIV/SHIV; TIGIT; elite controllers; immune checkpoints; non-human primates","During chronic HIV-1 infection, the upregulation of immune checkpoints (ICs) on lymphocytes contributes to persistent immune dysfunction, T-cell exhaustion, and inadequate virological control, highlighting the potential role of ICs in HIV functional cure strategy. Despite extensive research on ICs, the expression dynamics and immunological impact of ICs in natural HIV/SHIV infection, particularly among antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free elite controllers (ECs), remain poorly understood. In this study, we monitored a cohort of SHIVSF162P3-infected rhesus macaques (RMs), identifying four ECs and four progressors (PGs) through longitudinal evaluation. We observed low-level expression of ICs in both peripheral blood and lymph nodes of ECs, characterized by a particularly pronounced restriction in the expression of TIGIT and BTLA. This attenuated IC profile correlated with enhanced T-cell functionality, reduced exhaustion markers, and reduced viral reservoirs in peripheral and lymphoid tissues. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that TIGIT is a critical checkpoint marker involved in multiple synergistic cofunctions related to HIV/SIV-specific immune regulation. Collectively, our findings establish a dual role for ICs in perpetuating T-cell exhaustion and viral reservoir persistence, paving the way for IC blockade in future HIV cure strategies.IMPORTANCERhesus macaques spontaneously controlling simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) without antiretroviral therapy have low-level expression of immune molecules (ICs), characterized by TIGIT and BTLA. These molecules are linked to enhanced immune function and reduced viral presence in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that TIGIT is a critical checkpoint marker involved in multiple synergistic cofunctions related to HIV/SIV-specific immune regulation in both humans and macaques. Blocking TIGIT improved polyfunctional T-cell responses, thereby offering a potential new treatment strategy and providing critical insights for developing a functional HIV cure.","2025","2025 Jul 10","Yuting Sun;

Specific polymorphisms in the accessory proteins Vif and Vpr have been associated with diminished viral fitness in vitro and are more frequently detected in ECs compared to other individuals infected with HIV-1. To assess the frequency of gross genetic defects or polymorphisms that may attenuate the function of the HIV-1 accessory proteins Vif and Vpr within the proviral quasispecies of ECs. We performed single-genome amplification (SGA) and sequence analysis of the proviral quasispecies of the accessory genes vif and vpr in samples obtained from eight ECs with over 10 years of suppressive viral control and no evidence of disease progression. In subjects EC11, EC38 and EC52, most proviral clones encode full-length, intact vif and vpr open reading frames without known attenuating polymorphisms. Subject EC35 displayed stop codons in a substantial fraction of vif (33%) and vpr (67%) proviral clones. Subject EC36 exhibited the attenuating polymorphisms Vpr-Q3R + R77Q combined in all proviral clones. Subject EC17 showed stop codons in 20-30% of vif-vpr proviral clones, hypermutated sequences in 20% of vif proviral clones, and the attenuating polymorphism Vpr-R77Q in all proviral clones. Subject EC19 presented stop codons in 8-17% of vif-vpr proviral sequences, hypermutated sequences in 25% of vif-vpr proviral clones, and the polymorphisms Vif-R132S+Ins61(EDK) and Vpr-R77Q in all clones analysed. Finally, subject EC42 displayed stop codons in 25-38% of vif-vpr proviral sequences, hypermutated sequences in 25% of vif proviral clones, and the polymorphisms Vif-T20A+R132S and Vpr-R77Q in most (> 80%) proviral clones. Mutations associated with attenuation of HIV-1 Vif and/or Vpr functions may contribute to the long-term control of viral replication and disease progression in certain ECs.","2025","2025","Suwellen Sardinha Dias de Azevedo; Fernanda Heloise Côrtes; Mariza G Morgado; Brenda Hoagland; Larissa M Villela; Beatriz Grinsztejn; Valdilea Gonçalvez Veloso; Gonzalo Bello","Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST/AIDS, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST/AIDS, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST/AIDS, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST/AIDS, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de Arbovírus e Vírus Hemorrágicos, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil."

Studying ECs could yield insights into viral control mechanisms and potentially lead to a cure. We retrospectively characterized a cohort of people with HIV-2 who received care at the Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands. The aim was to identify categories of ECs based on plasma viral loads, CD4+ T-cell count, and responses to ART. Between 1989 and 2023, 52 people with HIV-2 were included, primarily of West African origin (80.8%). Follow-up ranged from <1 to 32 years (median, 16 years). Seven participants were lost to follow-up (13.5.%), and 18 participants died (34.6%), 7 before ART availability due to AIDS. The remaining 40 participants were included in the detailed analysis. Thirteen were ECs with CD4+ T cells >350 cells/mm3 and viral loads <200 copies/mL without use of ART. Four participants progressed to CD4+ T cells <350 cells/mm3 without symptoms of HIV despite undetectable viral loads (nonviremic progressors). Three individuals demonstrated EC status for at least 5 years but lost viral and immunologic control. Nineteen participants exhibited a classical phenotype of viremic progression. Five participants had HIV-1 and HIV-2. Finally, 1 participant had a unique phenotype with loss of control with an unexplained rebound in viremia, followed by resuppression without ART for >10 years (recontroller). These data highlight relevant trajectories among ECs. Understanding the underlying mechanisms can inform decisions on treatment and contribute to finding a cure for all people with HIV.","2025","2025 Jul","Kathryn S Hensley; Rob A Gruters; Els van Nood; Mariana de Mendonça Melo; Ronald J Overmars; Alicja U Górska; Casper Rokx; Cynthia Lungu; David A M C van de Vijver; Thibault Mesplède; Jeroen J A van Kampen","Department of Internal Medicine, Section Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Viroscience, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Internal Medicine, Section Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Internal Medicine, Section Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Viroscience, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Viroscience, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Internal Medicine, Section Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Viroscience, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Viroscience, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Viroscience, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Viroscience, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands."

Using whole blood (WB) could improve HIV-1 detectability as cellular elements may also contain HIV-1 nucleic acids. We used well-characterized paired WB/plasma panels to evaluate HIV-1 RNA detection inhibition by WB, specificity, and enhanced HIV-1 RNA detectability by WB compared to plasma. Panels included: spiked samples; NAT-/serology-, NAT+/serology+, and NAT-/serology+ blood donor samples; samples from persons with HIV (PWH) who started antiretroviral treatment (ART) at chronic infection stages; and from PWH under ART since acute/early infection. We found one false-positive result on WB testing of 100 NAT-/serology- blood donors, and evidence of modest HIV-1 detection inhibition. Among NAT-/serology+ donors, HIV-1 RNA detectability in plasma and WB was similar (P = 0.64). Among 50 PWH starting ART at chronic infection stages, detectability was 24% in plasma and 92% in WB (P < 0.001). Among 345 PWH on ART since acute/early infection, detectability was 10% in plasma and 16% in WB (P = 0.013). HIV-1 RNA detectability in both plasma and WB was progressively lower for earlier Fiebig stages at ART initiation. WB increased HIV-1 detectability relative to plasma in PWH who initiated ART at all but the earliest infection stages. We failed to find enhanced HIV-1 RNA detectability by WB in NAT-/serology+ blood donors, who may include elite controllers. Enhancing HIV-1 nucleic acid detectability could improve infection ascertainment among PWH on ART with blunted serologic reactivity; investigation of breakthrough infection in PrEP users; and potentially for virus rebound monitoring in HIV-1 cure studies. Currently, tests to detect HIV genetic materials (RNA/DNA) are done using the liquid component of a blood sample (plasma). However, HIV may be present in blood cellular components, such as white cells and platelets. Here, we investigated if using whole blood (WB; liquid + cellular components) could improve HIV RNA detectability compared to plasma. WB increased HIV RNA detectability in persons with HIV under treatment, including those with early treatment initiation, but not among blood donors with positive HIV serology and undetectable HIV RNA in the donation screening. Enhancing HIV RNA/DNA detectability would support HIV diagnosis in cases with blunted serologic response, such as persons with early antiretroviral treatment initiation or pre-exposure prophylaxis users. It would also be useful for monitoring virus rebound in HIV cure studies and in blood donation screening, where high test sensitivity is required to guarantee the safety of the blood supply.","2025","2025 Jul 09","Vivian I Avelino-Silva; Mars Stone; Leilani Montalvo; Clara Di Germanio; Sonia Bakkour; Marion C Lanteri; Eduard Grebe; Brian Custer; Xutao Deng; Renata Buccheri; Karen Harrington; Steven H Kleinman; Sandhya Vasan; Nittaya Phanuphak; Carlo Sacdalan; Siriwat Akapirat; Mark de Souza; Esper G Kallás; Sheila de Oliveira Garcia Mateos; Ester C Sabino; Philip J Norris; Michael P Busch; ","Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, São Paulo, State of São Paulo, Brazil.; Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Creative Testing Solutions, Tempe, Arizona, USA.; Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Hologic, Inc., San Diego, California, USA.; University of British Columbia, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.; U.S. Military HIV Research Program, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.; Henry M.

Slow progressors are rare individuals who can prevent or delay HIV disease progression without ART. It is unknown whether they experience immune aging akin to normal progressors on ART. We investigated persons living with HIV (PWH) who were either HIV slow progressors (n = 58), PWH on ART with undetectable HIV viremia (n = 58), or PWH not on ART with detectable viremia (n = 26), and 56 controls without HIV. The groups were well matched for age and sex. A panel of T-cell differentiation and immune aging markers was measured, along with T and B cell subset telomere length, adjusting for major confounders. Relative to the ART-suppressed HIV group, slow progressors showed immune aging markers indicative of more advanced aging, including lower CD8 naïve:effector memory ratio (standardized effect size -0.41 [95% CI -0.74, -0.07]), and shorter telomere length in B cells (-0.52 [-0.97, -0.07]), CD4 T cells (-0.58 [-0.94, -0.23]), and proliferative CD8 cells (-0.41 [-0.80, -0.01]). Comparison of slow progressors with the control group without HIV showed the same effects. Further, within the slow progressor group, immune aging patterns for the subgroup of elite controllers were not different. Our findings indicate that despite natural host control of HIV replication, slow progressors show evidence of disproportionately advanced immune aging. This reinforces the potential benefit of ART and emphasizes the need to both diagnose slow progressors and study their potential age-related comorbidities.","2025","2025 Jul","Anthony Y Y Hsieh; Renying Cai; Nicole F Bernard; Cécile L Tremblay; Hélène C F Côté; ","Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Centre for Blood Research, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Centre for Blood Research, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Edwin S.H.

However, despite this viral control, ECs exhibit increased incidences of various comorbid conditions and heightened systemic inflammation, which has been linked to monocyte activation. In this study, we performed an in-depth phenotypic analysis of monocytes in a cohort of long-term ECs (LTECs) and compared them to non-controller patients with ART-mediated control of HIV replication and to non-controller patients with uncontrolled viral replication. A total of 67 participants were included: 22 LTECs, 15 non-controllers on ART (onART), 10 non-controllers without ART (offART), and 20 uninfected controls (UCs) as a reference group. Monocyte phenotypes were analyzed using spectral flow cytometry with a 13-marker panel. The data were analyzed using two approaches: (a) FCS Express software v.7 to define different subsets of monocytes and assess the levels of expression of eight different monocyte functional markers and (b) R software v.4.1.1 for unsupervised multidimensional analysis, including batch correction, dimensionality reduction, and clustering analysis. Monocyte phenotypic profiling was conducted using three different approaches: (1) assessment of monocyte subsets (classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes); (2) evaluation of the levels of expression of eight monocyte functional markers, and (3) characterization of monocyte clusters defined through the dimensionality reduction of flow cytometry data (56 different clusters). The monocyte phenotype of the onART group closely resembled that of the UC group. In contrast, LTECs exhibited important alterations in the monocyte phenotype compared to that of the UCs, including (a) an increased proportion of intermediate monocytes and a decreased proportion of classical monocytes (p < 0.01), (b) altered expressions of functional markers across monocyte subsets (p < 0.05), and (c) alterations in sixteen different monocyte clusters (twelve decreased and four increased, p < 0.05). Many of these alterations were also observed when comparing the LTEC and onART groups. Our findings suggest that monocyte-driven mechanisms may contribute to HIV control in LTECs; however, some of these alterations could also promote systemic inflammation and immune activation. These observations provide a compelling rationale for considering therapeutic interventions in this unique population of PLWHs.","2025","2025 Apr 22","José M Benito; Daniel Jiménez-Carretero; Jaime Valentín-Quiroga; Ignacio Mahillo; José M Ligos; Clara Restrepo; Alfonso Cabello; Eduardo López-Collazo; Fátima Sánchez-Cabo; Miguel Górgolas; Norma Rallón","HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), 28003 Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, 28933 Móstoles, Spain.; Unidad de Bioinformática, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.; Grupo de Respuesta Inmune Innata, IdiPAZ, Hospital Universitario La Paz, 28046 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Statistics, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), 28049 Madrid, Spain.; Cytek Biosciences, Inc., Fremont, CA 94538, USA.; HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), 28003 Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, 28933 Móstoles, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Fundación Jiménez Díaz, 28040 Madrid, Spain.; Grupo de Respuesta Inmune Innata, IdiPAZ, Hospital Universitario La Paz, 28046 Madrid, Spain.; Unidad de Bioinformática, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Fundación Jiménez Díaz, 28040 Madrid, Spain.; HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), 28003 Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, 28933 Móstoles, Spain."
"8","40224654","A Participant-Derived Xenograft Mouse Model to Decode Autologous Mechanisms of HIV Control and Evaluate Immunotherapies.","Bio-protocol","","Autologous; HIV; Immunotherapies; Participant-derived; Small animal; T cells","Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a global health challenge with major research efforts being directed toward the unmet needs for a vaccine and a safe and scalable cure. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral replication but does not cure infection and so requires lifelong adherence. HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses play a crucial role in long-term HIV control as demonstrated in elite controllers, highlighting their potential in HIV cure strategies. Various HIV mouse models-including the human-hematopoietic stem cell (Hu-HSC) mouse, the bone marrow, liver, and thymus (BLT) mouse, and the human peripheral blood leukocyte (Hu-PBL) mouse-have deepened the understanding of HIV dynamics and facilitated the development of therapeutics. We developed the HIV participant-derived xenograft (HIV PDX) mouse model to enable long-term in vivo evaluation of bona fide autologous T-cell mechanisms of HIV control, including the antiviral activity of primary memory CD8+ (mCD8+) T cells taken directly from people with or without HIV, as well as testing potential immunotherapies. Additionally, this model faithfully recapitulates virus escape mutations in response to sustained CD8+ T-cell pressure, enabling the assessment of strategies to curb virus escape. In this model, NSG mice are engrafted with purified memory CD4+ (mCD4+) cells and infected with HIV; then, they receive autologous CD8+ T cells or T-cell products. Key advantages of this model include the minimization of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), which severely limits peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) or total CD4-engrafted mice, the ability to evaluate long-term natural donor-specific T-cell responses in vivo, and the lack of use of human fetal tissues required for most humanized mouse models of HIV. Key features • Long-term evaluation of bona fide autologous T cells. • Evaluation of immunomodulating drugs and T-cell products. • The protocol requires access to a BSL2+ tissue culture room, BSL2+ animal facility, and 6+ weeks to complete.","2025","2025 Apr 05","Emma Falling Iversen; Itzayana G Miller; Ole Søgaard; Ali Danesh; Brad R Jones","Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, New York, NY, USA."
"9","40166014","TGF-β mediates epigenetic control of innate antiviral responses and SIV reservoir size.","Research square","","","Immunotherapeutic approaches to eliminate latently HIV-infected cells are focused on the adaptive immune system. Herein we provide mechanistic evidence for a molecular cascade characterized by epigenetic reprogramming of innate myeloid cells and CD4 T cells. The coordinate regulation and gene expression mediated by transcription factors (TFs) IRF3, IRF7, STAT1 and C/EBPβ versus AP-1, promoted the development of innate antiviral immunity in these cells which was associated with control of viral load and decay of cell associated viral DNA (CA-vDNA) following analytical treatment interruption (ATI) in SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs) treated with anti-IL-10 and anti-PD-1. The prevalence of TGF-β/SMAD signaling in a subset of combo-treated RMs with high CA-vDNA (CA-vDNAhi) suppressed this antiviral activity through histone deacetylases, including HDAC11, as the latter reduced chromatin accessibility of IRFs and STATs and impeded their antiviral functions. The addition of HDAC inhibitors in vitro restored antiviral response in the presence of TGF-β. Induction of IL-6, a target gene of C/EBPβ, in CA-vDNAlo RMs, amplified the antiviral network through IRF9, a transcription factor upstream of IRF7. We identified a similar molecular cascade in HIV elite controllers, who maintain low to undetectable viremia and small viral reservoirs without treatment. These data highlight the importance of epigenetic regulation of the host in shaping innate antiviral immune responses that control viral rebound following ATI and reduce the viral reservoir, providing insight into potential strategies for HIV cure interventions.","2025","2025 Mar 19","Khader Ghneim; Felipe Ten-Caten; Ana Carolina Santana; Muhammad Bilal Latif; Diego Andres Diaz Dinamarca; Tamara García-Salum; Perla Mariana Del Rio Estrada; Puja Sohal; Zachary Strongin; Justin Harper; Sherrie Jean; Chelsea Wallace; Robert Balderas; Jeffrey D Lifson; Gopalan Raghunathan; Eric Rimmer; Cinthia Pastuskova; Guoxin Wu; Luca Micci; Luiz Felipe Martins Sieben; Pedro Cesar Lopes Gerum; Jessica Dos Santos; Mihai G Netea; Andre van der Ven; Guido Silvestri; Daria J Hazuda; Daniel M Gorman; Bonnie J Howell; Ashish A Sharma; Mirko Paiardini; Hugo Soudeyns; Susan Pereira Ribeiro; Rafick P Sekaly","Pathology Advanced Translational Research Unit (PATRU), Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, GA, USA.; Pathology Advanced Translational Research Unit (PATRU), Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, GA, USA.; Pathology Advanced Translational Research Unit (PATRU), Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, GA, USA.; Pathology Advanced Translational Research Unit (PATRU), Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, GA, USA.; Pathology Advanced Translational Research Unit (PATRU), Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, GA, USA.; Pathology Advanced Translational Research Unit (PATRU), Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, GA, USA.; Pathology Advanced Translational Research Unit (PATRU), Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, GA, USA.; Pathology Advanced Translational Research Unit (PATRU), Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, GA, USA.; Division of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Division of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Division of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Division of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA.; AIDS and Cancer Virus Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA.; Department of Discovery Biologics, Merck & Co.

While EC CD4+ T cells have been investigated for gene expression signatures associated with HIV-1 resistance, the expression and regulatory activity of transposable elements (TEs) remain unexplored. TEs can directly impact host immune responses to pathogens, including HIV-1, suggesting their activities could contribute to HIV-1 elite control. To begin testing this hypothesis, we conduct a TE-centric analysis of public multi-omics data from ECs and other populations. We find the CD4+ T cell transcriptome and retrotranscriptome of ECs are distinct from healthy controls, from people living with HIV-1 on antiretroviral therapy, and from viremic progressors. However, there is substantial transcriptomic heterogeneity among ECs. We categorize ECs into four clusters with distinct expression and chromatin accessibility profiles of TEs and antiviral factors. Several TE families with known immuno-regulatory activity are differentially expressed among ECs. Their expression positively correlates with their chromatin accessibility in ECs and negatively correlates with the expression of their KRAB zinc-finger (KZNF) repressors. This coordinated, locus-level variation forms a network of putative cis-regulatory elements for genes involved in HIV-1 restriction. We propose that the EC phenotype is driven in part by reduced KZNF-mediated repression of specific TE-derived cis-regulatory elements for antiviral genes, heightening their resistance against HIV-1. Our study reveals heterogeneity in the EC CD4+ T cell transcriptome, including variable expression of TEs and their KZNF controllers, that must be considered when deciphering HIV-1 control mechanisms.","2025","2025 Feb 24","Manvendra Singh; Sabrina M Leddy; Luis Pedro Iñiguez; Matthew L Bendall; Douglas F Nixon; Cédric Feschotte","Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.; Clinical Neuroscience, Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences, City Campus, Göttingen, Germany.; Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.; Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA. dnixon1@northwell.edu.; Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA. dnixon1@northwell.edu.; Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA. cf458@cornell.edu."

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed, comparing 543 HIV-1 EC individuals with 3,272 uninfected controls (CTR) of European ancestry. 8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and HLA class I and class II gene alleles were imputed to compare EC and CTR. Two thousand six hundred twenty-six SNPs were associated with EC (p<5.10-8), all located within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region. Stepwise regression analysis narrowed this list to 17 SNPs. In parallel, 22 HLA class I and II alleles were associated with EC. Through meticulous mapping of the LD between all identified signals and employing reciprocal covariate analyses, we delineated a final set of 6 independent SNPs and 3 HLA class I gene alleles that accounted for most of the associations observed with EC. Our study revealed the presence of cumulative haploblock effects (SNP rs9264942 contributing to the HLA-B*57:01 effect) and that several HLA allele associations were in fact caused by SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD). Upon investigating SNPs in LD with the selected 6 SNPs and 3 HLA class I alleles for their impact on protein function (either damaging or differential expression), we identified several compelling mechanisms potentially explaining EC among which: a multi-action mechanism of HLA-B*57:01 involving MICA mutations and MICB differential expression overcoming the HIV-1 blockade of NK cell response, and overexpression of ZBTB12 with a possible anti-HIV-1 effect through HERV-K interference; a deleterious mutation in PPP1R18 favoring viral budding associated with rs1233396. Our results show that MHC influence on EC likely extends beyond traditional HLA class I or class II allele associations, encompassing other MHC SNPs with various biological impacts. They point to the key role of NK cells in preventing HIV-1 infection. Our analysis shows that HLA-B*57:01 is indeed associated with partially functional MICA/MICB proteins which could also explain this marker's involvement in other diseases such as psoriasis. More broadly, our findings suggest that within any HLA class I and II association in diseases, there may exist distinct causal SNPs within this crucial, gene-rich, and LD-rich MHC region.","2025","2025 Jan 06","Myriam Rahmouni; Sigrid Le Clerc; Jean-Louis Spadoni; Taoufik Labib; Maxime Tison; Raissa Medina-Santos; Armand Bensussan; Ryad Tamouza; Jean-François Deleuze; Jean-François Zagury","Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, 2 rue Conté 75003, Paris, EA7528, France.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, 2 rue Conté 75003, Paris, EA7528, France.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, 2 rue Conté 75003, Paris, EA7528, France.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, 2 rue Conté 75003, Paris, EA7528, France.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, 2 rue Conté 75003, Paris, EA7528, France.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, 2 rue Conté 75003, Paris, EA7528, France.; Unité INSERM U976, Hôpital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.; Laboratoire Neuro-Psychiatrie translationnelle, Université Paris Est Créteil, INSERM U955, IMRB, Créteil, F-94010, France.; Laboratory for Genomics, Foundation Jean Dausset - CEPH, Paris, France.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, 2 rue Conté 75003, Paris, EA7528, France. zagury@cnam.fr."

In addition to having fewer infected cells resulting in fewer cells with HIV RNA, it is possible that lower levels of plasma viremia in controllers are due to a lower fraction of the infected cells having HIV-1 unspliced RNA (HIV usRNA) compared with NC. To directly test this possibility, we used sensitive and quantitative single-cell sequencing methods to compare the fraction of infected cells that contain one or more copies of HIV usRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from controllers and NC. The fraction of infected cells containing HIV usRNA did not differ between the two groups. Rather, the levels of viremia were strongly associated with the total number of infected cells that had HIV usRNA, as reported by others, with controllers having 34-fold fewer infected cells per million PBMC. These results reveal that viremic control is not associated with a lower fraction of proviruses expressing HIV usRNA, unlike what is reported for elite controllers, but is only related to having fewer infected cells overall, maybe reflecting greater immune clearance of infected cells. Our findings show that proviral silencing is not a key mechanism for viremic control and will help to refine strategies toward achieving HIV remission without ART.","2024","2024 Sep 03","Adam A Capoferri; Ann Wiegand; Feiyu Hong; Jana L Jacobs; Jonathan Spindler; Andrew Musick; Michael J Bale; Wei Shao; Michele D Sobolewski; Anthony R Cillo; Brian T Luke; Christine M Fennessey; Robert J Gorelick; Rebecca Hoh; Elias K Halvas; Steven G Deeks; John M Coffin; John W Mellors; Mary F Kearney","HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20007.; HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702.; Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.; Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.; HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702.; Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratories for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD 21702.; HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702.; Laboratory of Epigenetics and Immunity, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065.; Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratories for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD 21702.; Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.; Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15261.; Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratories for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD 21702.; AIDS and Cancer Virus Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD 21702.; AIDS and Cancer Virus Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD 21702.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.; Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.; Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University, Boston, MA 02111.; Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.; HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702."

Moreover, long-lived Th17 cells contribute to HIV persistence under ART. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations remain understudied. mRNA-sequencing was performed using Illumina technology on freshly FACS-sorted memory CCR6+CD4+ T-cells from successfully ART-treated (ST), elite controllers (EC), and uninfected donors (HD). Gene expression validation was performed by RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and in vitro functional assays. Decreased Th17 cell frequencies in STs and ECs versus HDs coincided with reduced Th17-lineage cytokine production in vitro. Accordingly, the RORγt/RORC2 repressor NR1D1 was upregulated, while the RORγt/RORC2 inducer Semaphorin 4D was decreased in memory CCR6+ T-cells of STs and ECs versus HDs. The presence of HIV-DNA in memory CCR6+ T-cells of ST and EC corresponded with the downregulation of HIV restriction factors (SERINC3, KLF3, and RNF125) and HIV inhibitors (tetraspanins), along with increased expression of the HIV-dependency factor MRE11, indicative of higher susceptibility/permissiveness to HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, markers of DNA damage/modification were elevated in memory CCR6+ T-cells of STs and ECs versus HDs, in line with their increased activation (CD38/HLA-DR), senescence/exhaustion phenotype (CTLA-4/PD-1/CD57) and their decreased expression of proliferation marker Ki-67. These results reveal new molecular mechanisms of Th17 cell deficit in ST and EC PWH despite a successful control of HIV-1 replication. This knowledge points to potential therapeutic interventions to limit HIV-1 infection and restore frequencies, effector functions, and senescence/exhaustion in Th17 cells.

The study compared ""HIV-controllers"" (including elite-controllers and long-term-non-progressors), who were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and ""HIV-treatment"" (HIV-infected subjects with a recent diagnosis and on ART). A matched cohort of ""non-HIV subjects"" was created. NRD was defined as at least one altered (not normal) ophthalmological parameter (functional or structural). Functional (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, chromatic vision, visual field) and structural parameters (ganglion cells, macular nerve fibre layer, peripapillary nerve fibre layers, vascular calibre) as well as quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study-HIV Short Form-30) were assessed. Between March 2012 and November 2015, the study included all HIV-controllers (16 elite-controllers, 1 long-term-non-progressor), 11 HIV-treatment and 16 non-HIV. Prevalence of NRD at baseline was 88.2% (15/17, 95% CI: 65.7%-96.7%), 90.9% (10/11, 95% CI: 62.3%-98.4%) and 56.3% (9/16, 95% CI: 33.2%-76.9%), respectively. Cumulative incidence at 3 years was 50% (1/2), 100% (1/1) and 33.3% (2/6), respectively. None of the participants manifested ocular clinical symptoms. Three years later, prevalence of NRD was 92.3% (12/13, 95% CI: 66.7%-98.6%), 75% (6/8, 95% CI: 40.9%-92.9%) and 50.0% (7/14, 95% CI: 26.8%-73.2%), respectively.

Drug selectivity assay with WG-am and ARVs agains HIV-1 resistant isolates were carried out. Subsequently, two methods, Chou-Talalay's Combination Index (CI) and ZIP synergy score (SS), were used to quantify the synergism.

Much evidence suggests that this spontaneous control of HIV has a cost in terms of T cell homeostasis alterations. We performed a deep phenotypic study to obtain insight into T cell homeostasis disturbances in ECs maintaining long-term virologic and immunologic control of HIV (long-term elite controllers; LTECs). Forty-seven PLWH were included: 22 LTECs, 15 non-controllers under successful antiretroviral therapy (onART), and 10 non-controllers not receiving ART (offART). Twenty uninfected participants (UCs) were included as a reference. T cell homeostasis was analyzed by spectral flow cytometry and data were analyzed using dimensionality reduction and clustering using R software v3.3.2. Dimensionality reduction and clustering yielded 57 and 54 different CD4 and CD8 T cell clusters, respectively. The offART group showed the highest perturbation of T cell homeostasis, with 18 CD4 clusters and 15 CD8 clusters significantly different from those of UCs. Most of these alterations were reverted in the onART group. Interestingly, LTECs presented several disturbances of T cell homeostasis with 15 CD4 clusters and 13 CD8 clusters different from UC. Moreover, there was a specific profile of T cell homeostasis alterations associated with LTECs, characterized by increases in clusters of naïve T cells, increases in clusters of non-senescent effector CD8 cells, and increases in clusters of central memory CD4 cells. These results demonstrate that, compared to ART-mediated control of HIV, the spontaneous control of HIV is associated with several disturbances in CD4 and CD8 T cell homeostasis. These alterations could be related to the existence of a potent and efficient virus-specific T cell response, and to the ability to halt disease progression by maintaining an adequate pool of CD4 T cells.","2024","2024 May 29","José M Benito; Daniel Jiménez-Carretero; Clara Restrepo; José M Ligos; Jaime Valentín-Quiroga; Ignacio Mahillo; Alfonso Cabello; Eduardo López-Collazo; Fátima Sánchez-Cabo; Miguel Górgolas; Vicente Estrada; Norma Rallón; ","HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), 28040 Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, 28933 Móstoles, Spain.; Unidad de Bioinformática, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.; HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), 28040 Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, 28933 Móstoles, Spain.; Cytek Biosciences, Inc., Fremont, CA 94538, USA.; Grupo de Respuesta Inmune Innata, IdiPAZ, Hospital Universitario La Paz, 28046 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Statistics, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), 28040 Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Fundación Jiménez Díaz, 28040 Madrid, Spain.; Grupo de Respuesta Inmune Innata, IdiPAZ, Hospital Universitario La Paz, 28046 Madrid, Spain.; Unidad de Bioinformática, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Fundación Jiménez Díaz, 28040 Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Clínico San Carlos, 28040 Madrid, Spain.; HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), 28040 Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, 28933 Móstoles, Spain."

The critical part that they take is in transcriptional regulation of HIV through monitoring various cellular signaling pathways. Reportedly, AKT and MAPK signaling pathways serve a crucial role in modulation of HIV infection. In the current investigation, we utilized bioinformatics tools to predict the lncRNAs that have the ability to interact with MAPK3, AKT, and FOXO1. Then, PBMC expression levels of lncRNAs and their target genes (AKT, FOXO1 and MAPK3) measured in the ECs (n = 15), HIV-positive (n = 40) patients and healthy control subjects (n = 40). We found a significant increase and decrease in the level of AKT and FOXO1 expression within the ECs group, respectively than in the HIV + group (P-value <0.0001 and 0.04, respectively). In the ECs group, the level of TINCR and RP11-156E8.1 was overexpressed compared to the HIV + group (P-value: 0.004 and 0.001, respectively).

"25","38504093","IFNα induces CCR5 in CD4+ T cells of HIV patients causing pathogenic elevation.","Communications medicine","","","Among people living with HIV, elite controllers (ECs) maintain an undetectable viral load, even without receiving anti-HIV therapy. In non-EC patients, this therapy leads to marked improvement, including in immune parameters, but unlike ECs, non-EC patients still require ongoing treatment and experience co-morbidities. In-depth, comprehensive immune analyses comparing EC and treated non-EC patients may reveal subtle, consistent differences. This comparison could clarify whether elevated circulating interferon-alpha (IFNα) promotes widespread immune cell alterations and persists post-therapy, furthering understanding of why non-EC patients continue to need treatment. Levels of IFNα in HIV-infected EC and treated non-EC patients were compared, along with blood immune cell subset distribution and phenotype, and functional capacities in some cases. In addition, we assessed mechanisms potentially associated with IFNα overload. Treatment of non-EC patients results in restoration of IFNα control, followed by marked improvement in distribution numbers, phenotypic profiles of blood immune cells, and functional capacity. These changes still do not lead to EC status, however, and IFNα can induce these changes in normal immune cell counterparts in vitro. Hypothesizing that persistent alterations could arise from inalterable effects of IFNα at infection onset, we verified an IFNα-related mechanism.

It is essential to characterize the quality of the HIV reservoir in terms of these phenotypes in order to identify the factors that lead to HIV progression and to open new avenues toward an HIV cure.METHODSThe characterization of HIV-1 reservoir from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed using next-generation sequencing techniques, such as full-length individual and matched integration site proviral sequencing (FLIP-Seq; MIP-Seq).RESULTSPCs and TCs, before losing virological control, presented significantly lower total, intact, and defective proviruses compared with those of participants on antiretroviral therapy (ART). No differences were found in total and defective proviruses between PCs and TCs. However, intact provirus levels were lower in PCs compared with TCs; indeed the intact/defective HIV-DNA ratio was significantly higher in TCs. Clonally expanded intact proviruses were found only in PCs and located in centromeric satellite DNA or zinc-finger genes, both associated with heterochromatin features. In contrast, sampled intact proviruses were located in permissive genic euchromatic positions in TCs.CONCLUSIONSThese results suggest the need for, and can give guidance to, the design of future research to identify a distinct proviral landscape that may be associated with the persistent control of HIV-1 without ART.FUNDINGInstituto de Salud Carlos III (FI17/00186, FI19/00083, MV20/00057, PI18/01532, PI19/01127 and PI22/01796), Gilead Fellowships (GLD22/00147).

"27","38168352","Transposable elements may enhance antiviral resistance in HIV-1 elite controllers.","bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology","","","Less than 0.5% of people living with HIV-1 are elite controllers (ECs) - individuals who have a replication-competent viral reservoir in their CD4+ T cells but maintain undetectable plasma viremia without the help of antiretroviral therapy. While the EC CD4+ T cell transcriptome has been investigated for gene expression signatures associated with disease progression (or, in this case, a lack thereof), the expression and regulatory activity of transposable elements (TEs) in ECs has not been explored. Yet previous studies have established that TEs can directly impact the immune response to pathogens, including HIV-1. Thus, we hypothesize that the regulatory activities of TEs could contribute to the natural resistance of ECs against HIV-1. We perform a TE-centric analysis of previously published multi-omics data derived from EC individuals and other populations. We find that the CD4+ T cell transcriptome and retrotranscriptome of ECs are distinct from healthy controls, treated patients, and viremic progressors. However, there is a substantial level of transcriptomic heterogeneity among ECs. We categorize individuals with distinct chromatin accessibility and expression profiles into four clusters within the EC group, each possessing unique repertoires of TEs and antiviral factors. Notably, several TE families with known immuno-regulatory activity are differentially expressed among ECs. Their transcript levels in ECs positively correlate with their chromatin accessibility and negatively correlate with the expression of their KRAB zinc-finger (KZNF) repressors. This coordinated variation is seen at the level of individual TE loci likely acting or, in some cases, known to act as cis-regulatory elements for nearby genes involved in the immune response and HIV-1 restriction. Based on these results, we propose that the EC phenotype is driven in part by the reduced availability of specific KZNF proteins to repress TE-derived cis-regulatory elements for antiviral genes, thereby heightening their basal level of resistance to HIV-1 infection. Our study reveals considerable heterogeneity in the CD4+ T cell transcriptome of ECs, including variable expression of TEs and their KZNF controllers, that must be taken into consideration to decipher the mechanisms enabling HIV-1 control.","2023","2023 Dec 12","Manvendra Singh; Sabrina M Leddy; Luis Pedro Iñiguez; Matthew L Bendall; Douglas F Nixon; Cédric Feschotte","Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.; Clinical Neuroscience, Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences, City Campus, Göttingen, Germany.; Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.; Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA."

We performed a genome-wide Association Study comparing 543 HIV Elite Controllers with 3,272 uninfected controls of European descent. Using the latest database for imputation, we analyzed 35,552 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region. Our analysis identified 2,626 SNPs significantly associated (p<5. 10-8) with elite control of HIV-1 infection, including well-established MHC signals such as the rs2395029-G allele which tags HLA-B*57:01. A thorough investigation of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with rs2395029 revealed an extensive haploblock spanning 1.9 megabases in the MHC region tagging HLA-B*57:01, comprising 379 SNP alleles impacting 72 genes. This haploblock contains damaging variations in proteins like NOTCH4 and DXO and is also associated with a strong differential pattern of expression of multiple MHC genes such as HLA-B, MICB, and ZBTB12. The study was expanded to include two cohorts of seropositive African-American individuals, where a haploblock tagging the HLA-B*57:03 allele was similarly associated with control of viral load. The mRNA expression profile of this haploblock in African Americans closely mirrored that in the European cohort. These findings suggest that additional molecular mechanisms beyond the conventional antigen-presenting role of class I HLA molecules may contribute to the observed influence of HLA-B*57:01/B*57:03 alleles on HIV-1 elite control. Overall, this study has uncovered a large haploblock associated with HLA-B*57 alleles, providing novel insights into their massive effect on HIV-1 elite control.","2023","2023","Myriam Rahmouni; Lorenzo De Marco; Jean-Louis Spadoni; Maxime Tison; Raissa Medina-Santos; Taoufik Labib; Josselin Noirel; Ryad Tamouza; Sophie Limou; Olivier Delaneau; Jacques Fellay; Armand Bensussan; Sigrid Le Clerc; Paul J McLaren; Jean-François Zagury","Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, EA7528, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, HESAM Université, Paris, France.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, EA7528, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, HESAM Université, Paris, France.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, EA7528, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, HESAM Université, Paris, France.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, EA7528, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, HESAM Université, Paris, France.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, EA7528, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, HESAM Université, Paris, France.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, EA7528, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, HESAM Université, Paris, France.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, EA7528, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, HESAM Université, Paris, France.; Université Paris Est Créteil, INSERM U955, IMRB, Laboratoire Neuro-Psychiatrie translationnelle, Créteil, France.; Nantes Université, Ecole Centrale Nantes, INSERM, Center for Research in Transplantation and Translational Immunology (CR2TI), Nantes, France.; Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Global Health Institute, School of Life Sciences, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Unité INSERM U976, Hôpital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, EA7528, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, HESAM Université, Paris, France.; Sexually Transmitted and Blood-Borne Infections Division at JC Wilt Infectious Diseases Research Centre, National Microbiology Laboratory Branch, Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.; Laboratoire Génomique, Bioinformatique, et Chimie Moléculaire, EA7528, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, HESAM Université, Paris, France."

Using genome-wide assessments of activating and inhibitory chromatin features, we demonstrate here that cytotoxic NK (cNK) cells from elite controllers (ECs) display elevated activating histone modifications at the interleukin 2 (IL-2)/IL-15 receptor β chain and the BCL2 gene loci. These histone changes translate into increased responsiveness of cNK cells to paracrine IL-15 secretion, which coincides with higher levels of IL-15 transcription by myeloid dendritic cells in ECs. The distinct immune crosstalk between these innate immune cell populations results in improved IL-15-dependent cNK cell survival and cytotoxicity, paired with a metabolic profile biased toward IL-15-mediated glycolytic activities. Together, these results suggest that cNK cells from ECs display a programmed IL-15 response signature and support the emerging role of innate immune pathways in natural, drug-free control of HIV-1.","2023","2023 Dec 26","Ciputra Adijaya Hartana; Melanie Lancien; Ce Gao; Yelizaveta Rassadkina; Mathias Lichterfeld; Xu G Yu","Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

The expression of miRNAs was assessed between healthy control groups and patient groups including ART-naïve HIV, HIV ART, ECs, and coinfection (HIV-HBV and HIV-HCV) via real-time PCR technique. Besides, the expression level of the nef gene and cellular factors were assessed by the ELISA method. The differences in the level of cellular factors and selected miRNAs between study groups were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis H or one-way ANOVA test. In addition, the potential of selected miRNAs as biomarkers for discriminating study groups was assessed by the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Some miRNAs in ECs, HIV ART, and healthy controls have similar expression patterns, whereas a miRNA expression profile of patient groups significantly differed compared to EC and control groups. According to ROC curve analyses, the miR-17-5p, miR-140-3p miR-191-5p, miR-200c-3p, and miR-N367 can be served as biomarkers for discriminating ECs from ART-naïve HIV-infected groups. There was a significant correlation between some miRNAs and cellular factors/the viral load as well. This report demonstrated a differentiation in the expression of selected immunological factors and cellular/viral miRNAs in ECs compared to other patient groups. Some miRNAs and cellular factors are involved in the viral replication control, immune response/modulation and can be used as biomarkers for diagnosis of ECs and differentiation with other groups. Differential expression of these miRNAs and cellular factors in different stages of HIV infection can help in finding novel ways for infection control.","2023","2023","Bashdar Mahmud Hussen; Majid Noori; Babak Sayad; Maryam Ebadi Fard Azar; Javid Sadri Nahand; Mobina Bayat; Farhad Babaei; Romina Karampour; Farah Bokharaei-Salim; Hamed Mirzaei; Mohsen Moghoofei; Hossein Bannazadeh Baghi","Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Hawler Medical University, Erbil, Iraq.; AJA University of Medical Sciences, Golestan Hospital Research Center, Tehran, Iran.; Infectious Diseases Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.; Student Research Committee, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.; Department of Pathobiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran.; Department of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; HIV Laboratory of National Center, Vice Chancellor for Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Institute for Basic Sciences, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.; Infectious Diseases Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.; Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.; Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Department of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."

Integration features of intact proviruses in elite controllers (ECs) and people on long-term therapy suggest that proviruses in specific chromosomal locations can evade immune surveillance. However, direct evidence of this mechanism is missing.METHODSIn this case report, we characterized integration sites and full genome sequences of expanded T cell clones in an EC before and after chemoradiation. We identified the cognate peptide of infected clones to investigate cell proliferation and virus production induced by T cell activation, and susceptibility to autologous CD8+ T cells.RESULTSThe proviral landscape was dominated by 2 large clones with replication-competent proviruses integrated into zinc finger (ZNF) genes (ZNF470 and ZNF721) in locations previously associated with deeper latency. A third nearly intact provirus, with a stop codon in Pol, was integrated into an intergenic site. Upon stimulation with cognate Gag peptides, infected clones proliferated extensively and produced virus, but the provirus in ZNF721 was 200-fold less inducible. While autologous CD8+ T cells decreased the proliferation of cells carrying the intergenic provirus, they had no effect on cells with the provirus in the ZNF721 gene.CONCLUSIONSWe provide direct evidence that upon activation of infected clones by cognate antigen, the lower inducibility of intact proviruses in ZNF genes can result in immune evasion and persistence.FUNDINGOffice of the NIH Director and National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research; NIAID, NIH; Johns Hopkins University Center for AIDS Research.","2023","2023 Nov 01","Filippo Dragoni; Abena K Kwaa; Caroline C Traut; Rebecca T Veenhuis; Bezawit A Woldemeskel; Angelica Camilo-Contreras; Hayley E Raymond; Arbor G Dykema; Eileen P Scully; Amanda M Rosecrans; Kellie N Smith; Frederic D Bushman; Francesco R Simonetti; Joel N Blankson","Department of Medicine.; Department of Medicine.; Department of Medicine.; Department of Molecular and Comparative Pathobiology, and.; Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Department of Medicine.; Department of Medicine.; Department of Microbiology, University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and.; Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Department of Medicine.; Department of Medicine.; Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and.; Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Department of Microbiology, University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Medicine.; Department of Molecular and Comparative Pathobiology, and.; Department of Medicine.; Department of Molecular and Comparative Pathobiology, and."

Even though antiretroviral treatments (ART) have significantly increased HIV patient survival, an underlying chronic inflammation persists leading to HIV-related comorbidities. In this context, changes in microRNAs (miRNAs) expression may contribute to this inflammatory response. This study aims to detect differential expression of circulating miRNAs in treatment-naïve HIV-infected individuals compared to uninfected controls and evaluation of altered miRNAs after one year of ART. Serum from patients and controls was collected at baseline and after 48-weeks on ART in HIV-treated patients. Circulating miRNAs were analysed using next generation sequencing. A total of 32 HIV patients and 10 controls were recruited. Of HIV+ individuals, 7 were long-term non-progressors (elite controllers), a group of HIV-infected individuals that spontaneously control the infection. Higher circulating levels of miR-21-5p, and lower levels of miR-6503-3p and miR-3135b were detected in HIV+ progressors. After one year of ART, these miRNAs remain altered. Moreover, miR-21-5p and miR-6503-3p were also altered in elite controllers compared to control group. In silico analyses showed that miR-21-5p target pathways are related to inflammation mechanisms and immune system. miR-21-5p circulating levels are involved in inflammation and oxidative stress mechanisms in HIV patients even after one year of ART or in elite controllers.","2023","2023 Oct","Javier Meseguer-Donlo; Jade Soldado-Folgado; Juan Du; Alicia González-Mena; Fabiola Blasco-Hernando; Esperanza Cañas-Ruano; Xavier Nogués; Hernando Knobel; Natalia Garcia-Giralt; Robert Güerri-Fernández","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Medicine and Life Sciences (MELIS), Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.; Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.; IMIM (Hospital del Mar Research Institute), Parc de Salut Mar, Department of Infectious Diseases, Barcelona, Spain.; IMIM (Hospital del Mar Research Institute), Parc de Salut Mar, Department of Infectious Diseases, Barcelona, Spain.; IMIM (Hospital del Mar Research Institute), Parc de Salut Mar, Department of Infectious Diseases, Barcelona, Spain.; IMIM (Hospital del Mar Research Institute), Parc de Salut Mar, Department of Infectious Diseases, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain; IMIM (Hospital del Mar Research Institute), Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Fragilidad y Envejecimiento Saludable (CIBERFES), ISCIII, Barcelona, Spain.; IMIM (Hospital del Mar Research Institute), Parc de Salut Mar, Department of Infectious Diseases, Barcelona, Spain.; IMIM (Hospital del Mar Research Institute), Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Fragilidad y Envejecimiento Saludable (CIBERFES), ISCIII, Barcelona, Spain.

Targeting inflammation may decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. An open label randomized study was conducted to evaluate the effect of nine months of 81 mg aspirin versus 40 mg atorvastatin in antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated PWH and elite controllers (EC), not on ART. Biomarkers associated with inflammation and virologic indices were measured and analyzed using nonparametric and linear mixed effect models. Fifty-three participants were randomized and 44 were included in the final analysis. Median age was 54 years, 72% were male, 59% were Black. Median CD4 + count was 595 cells/μl in the aspirin and 717 cells/μl in the atorvastatin arm. After 9 months of treatment, plasma soluble (s) CD14 + was reduced in the aspirin group within both treated PWH and EC ( P  = 0.0229), yet only within treated PWH in the atorvastatin group ( P  = 0.0128). A 2.3% reduction from baseline in tissue factor levels was also observed in the aspirin arm, driven by the EC group. In the atorvastatin arm, there was a 4.3% reduction in interleukin-8 levels ( P  = 0.02) and a small decrease of activated CD4 + T cells ( P  < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed in the plasma HIV viral load and cell-associated (CA) HIV DNA and RNA. Aspirin and atorvastatin could play a role in targeting HIV-associated inflammation.

Exceptional elite controllers do not show disease progression for more than 25 years. Different mechanisms have been proposed and several elements of both innate and adaptive immunity are implicated. Vaccines are immune stimulating agents that can promote HIV-RNA transcription; transient plasma HIV-RNA detectability has been described within 7-14 days after different vaccinations. The most reliable mechanism involved in virosuppressed people living with HIV is a generalized inflammatory response that activates bystander cells harboring latent HIV. So far no data about viral load increase in elite controllers after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are reported in literature. We report the case of a 65-year-old woman of European ancestry, diagnosed with HIV-1/HCV co-infection more than 25 years ago. Since then, HIV-RNA remained undetectable and she never received ARV therapy. In 2021 she was vaccinated with mRNA-BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech®). She was administered with three doses in June, July and October 2021, respectively. The last available viral load was undetectable in March 2021. We observed an increase of VL at 32 cp/ml and 124 cp/mL, two and seven months after the second vaccine dose, respectively. During monthly follow-up, HIV-RNA gradually and spontaneously dropped becoming undetectable without ARV intervention. COVID-19 serology was positive with IgG 535 BAU/mL, showing response to vaccination. We measured total HIV-DNA at different time-points and we found it detectable both at the time of the higher plasma HIV-RNA (30 cp/10^6 PBMCs) and when it was undetectable (13 cp/10^6 PBMCs), in reduction. This case is the first report, to our knowledge, describing a rebound of plasma HIV-RNA in an elite controller after three doses of mRNA-BNT162b2 vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. Concomitantly with a spontaneous reduction of plasma HIV-RNA ten months after the third dose of mRNA-BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech®) without antiretroviral therapy intervention, we observed a reduction of total HIV-DNA in peripheral mononuclear cells. The potential role of vaccinations in altering HIV reservoir, even in elite controllers when plasma HIV-RNA is undetectable, could be a valuable aspect to take into account for the future HIV eradication interventions.","2023","2023 Jun 13","L Di Girolamo; M Ferrara; G Trevisan; B M Longo; T Allice; E Burdino; F Alladio; S Fantino; G Di Perri; A Calcagno; S Bonora","Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Corso Svizzera 164, Turin, 10149, Italy.; Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Corso Svizzera 164, Turin, 10149, Italy. micol.ferrara29@gmail.com.; Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Corso Svizzera 164, Turin, 10149, Italy.; Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Corso Svizzera 164, Turin, 10149, Italy.; Laboratory of Microbiology and Virology, Amedeo di Savoia Hospital ASL Città di Torino, Turin, Italy.; Laboratory of Microbiology and Virology, Amedeo di Savoia Hospital ASL Città di Torino, Turin, Italy.; Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Corso Svizzera 164, Turin, 10149, Italy.; Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Corso Svizzera 164, Turin, 10149, Italy.; Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Corso Svizzera 164, Turin, 10149, Italy.; Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Corso Svizzera 164, Turin, 10149, Italy.; Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Corso Svizzera 164, Turin, 10149, Italy."

Most have a small HIV-1 reservoir composed of identical proviral sequences maintained by clonal expansion of infected CD4+ T cells. However, some have a more diverse peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-associated HIV-1 reservoir with unique sequences. To understand the turnover dynamics of the PBMC-associated viral quasispecies in ECs with relatively diverse circulating proviral reservoirs. We performed single genome amplification of the env gene at three time points during six years in two EC with high intra-host HIV DNA diversity. Both EC displayed quite diverse PBMCs-associated viral quasispecies (mean env diversity = 1.9-4.1%) across all time-points comprising both identical proviruses that are probably clonally expanded and unique proviruses with evidence of ongoing evolution. HIV-1 env glycosylation pattern suggests that ancestral and evolving proviruses may display different phenotypes of resistance to broadly neutralising antibodies consistent with persistent immune pressure. Evolving viruses may progressively replace the ancestral ones or may remain as minor variants in the circulating proviral population. These findings support that the high intra-host HIV-1 diversity of some EC resulted from long-term persistence of archival proviruses combined with the continuous reservoir's reseeding and low, but measurable, viral evolution despite undetectable viremia.","2023","2023","Suwellen Sardinha Dias de Azevedo; Fernanda Heloise Côrtes; Larissa M Villela; Brenda Hoagland; Beatriz Grinsztejn; Valdilea Gonçalvez Veloso; Mariza G Morgado; Gonzalo Bello","Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.; Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil."

Normally, messenger RNA (mRNA) tails of replication-dependent histones (RDH) that safeguard naked nuclear DNAs are protected by a specialized stem-loop instead of polyadenylation. Here, we showed that infection by various RNA viruses (including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) induced aberrant polyadenylation of RDH mRNAs (pARDH) that resulted in inflammation or cellular senescence, based on which we constructed a pARDH inflammation score (pARIS). We further investigated pARIS elevation in various disease conditions, including different types of virus infection, cancer, and cellular senescence. Notably, we found that pARIS was positively correlated with coronavirus disease 2019 severity in specific immune cell types. We also detected a subset of HIV-1 elite controllers characterized by pARDH ""flipping"" potentially mediated by HuR. Importantly, pARIS was positively associated with transcription of endogenous retrovirus but negatively associated with most immune cell infiltration in tumors of various cancer types. Finally, we identified and experimentally verified two pARIS regulators, ADAR1 and ZKSCAN1, which was first linked to inflammation. The ZKSCAN1 was known as a transcription factor but instead was shown to regulate pARIS as a novel RNA binding protein. Both regulators were upregulated under most infection and inflammation conditions.

The percentage of CCR5 + CD4 + T cells was similar between HIV controllers and treated HIV non-controllers (ECs vs. NCs, P = 0.6010; VCs vs. NCs, P = 0.0702) but T cells from controllers had significantly reduced CCR5 expression on their cell surface (ECs vs. NCs, P = 0.0210; VCs vs. NCs, P = 0.0312). Furthermore, we identified rs1799987 SNP among a subset of HIV controllers, a mutation previously reported to reduce CCR5 expression. In stark contrast, we identified the rs41469351 SNP to be common among HIV non-controllers. This SNP has previously been shown to be associated with increased perinatal HIV transmission, vaginal shedding of HIV-infected cells and increased risk of death. CCR5 has a non-redundant role in HIV control among Ugandan HIV controllers. HIV controllers maintain high CD4 + T cells despite being ART naïve partly because their CD4 + T cells have significantly reduced CCR5 densities.","2023","2023 May 25","Brian Nyiro; Sharon Bright Amanya; Alice Bayiyana; Francis Wasswa; Eva Nabulime; Alex Kayongo; Immaculate Nankya; Gerald Mboowa; David Patrick Kateete; Obondo James Sande","New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.; Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.; Centre for AIDS Research Laboratory, Joint Clinical Research Centre, Wakiso, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.; Makerere University Lung Institute, Kampala, Uganda.; Centre for AIDS Research Laboratory, Joint Clinical Research Centre, Wakiso, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda. ojsande@gmail.com."

Despite treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART), the majority of people living with HIV (PLWH) maintain residual levels of inflammation, a low degree of immune activation, and higher sensitivity to cell death in their memory CD4+ T cell compartment. To date, the mechanisms responsible for this high sensitivity remain elusive. We have identified the transcription factor IRF-5 to be involved in impairing the maintenance of murine CD4+ T cells during chronic infection. Here, we investigate whether IRF-5 also contributes to memory CD4+ T cell loss during HIV-1 infection. We show that TLR7 and IRF-5 were upregulated in memory CD4+ T cells from PLWH, when compared with naturally protected elite controllers and HIVfree participants. TLR7 was upstream of IRF-5, promoting Caspase 8 expression in CD4+ T cells from ART HIV-1+ but not from HIVfree donors. Interestingly, the TLR7/IRF-5 axis acted synergistically with the Fas/FasL pathway, suggesting that TLR7 and IRF-5 expression in ART HIV-1+ memory CD4+ T cells represents an imprint that predisposes cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. This predisposition could be blocked using IRF-5 inhibitory peptides, suggesting IRF-5 blockade as a possible therapy to prevent memory CD4+ T cell loss in PLWH.","2023","2023 Jul 10","Liseth Carmona-Pérez; Xavier Dagenais-Lussier; Linh T Mai; Tanja Stögerer; Sharada Swaminathan; Stéphane Isnard; Matthew R Rice; Betsy J Barnes; Jean-Pierre Routy; Julien van Grevenynghe; Simona Stäger","Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie, and Infectiopôle-INRS, Laval, Quebec, Canada.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie, and Infectiopôle-INRS, Laval, Quebec, Canada.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie, and Infectiopôle-INRS, Laval, Quebec, Canada.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie, and Infectiopôle-INRS, Laval, Quebec, Canada.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie, and Infectiopôle-INRS, Laval, Quebec, Canada.; Division of Hematology and Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Center for Autoimmune Musculoskeletal and Hematopoietic Diseases, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York, USA.; Center for Autoimmune Musculoskeletal and Hematopoietic Diseases, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York, USA.; Division of Hematology and Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie, and Infectiopôle-INRS, Laval, Quebec, Canada.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie, and Infectiopôle-INRS, Laval, Quebec, Canada."

Here we show that all immune cells from HIV-infected persons are impaired in non-EC, but not in EC. Since HIV infects few cell types, these results suggest an additional mediator of pathogenesis. We identify that mediator as elevated pathogenic IFNα, controlled by EC likely by their preserved potent NK-cells and later by other killer cells. Since the earliest days of infection predict outcome genetic or chance events must be key to EC, and since we found no unique immune parameter at the onset, we suggest a chance infection with a lower HIV inoculum.

We also assessed how combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), administered in conjunction with phytocannabinoid delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), altered the abundance and compartmentalization of exmiRNAs in the EVs and ECs of SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs). Unlike cellular miRNAs, exmiRNAs in blood plasma may serve as minimally invasive disease indicators because they are readily detected in stable forms. The stability of exmiRNAs in cell culture fluids and body fluids (urine, saliva, tears, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), semen, blood) is based on their association with different carriers (lipoproteins, EVs, and ECs) that protect them from the activities of endogenous RNases. Here, we showed that in the blood plasma of uninfected control RMs, significantly less exmiRNAs were associated with EVs compared to the level (30% higher) associated with ECs, and that SIV infection altered the profile of EVs and ECs miRNAome (Manuscript 1). In people living with HIV (PLWH), host-encoded miRNAs regulate both host and viral gene expression, which may serve as indicators of disease or treatment biomarkers. The profile of miRNAs in blood plasma of PLWH (elite controllers versus viremic patients) are different, indicating that HIV may alter host miRNAome. However, there are no studies assessing the effect of cART or other substances used by PLWH, such as THC, on the abundance of exmiRNA and their association with EVs and ECs. Moreover, longitudinal exmiRNA profiles following SIV infection, treatment with THC, cART, or THC+cART remains unclear. Here, we serially analyzed miRNAs associated with blood plasma derived EVs and ECs. Methods: Paired EVs and ECs were separated from EDTA blood plasma of male Indian rhesus macaques (RMs) in five treatment groups, including VEH/SIV, VEH/SIV/cART, THC/SIV, THC/SIV/cART, or THC alone. Separation of EVs and ECs was achieved with the unparalleled nano-particle purification tool ─PPLC, a state-of-the-art, innovative technology equipped with gradient agarose bead sizes and a fast fraction collector that allows high resolution separation and retrieval of preparative quantities of sub-populations of extracellular structures. Global miRNA profiles of the paired EVs and ECs were determined with RealSeq Biosciences (Santa Cruz, CA) custom sequencing platform by conducting small RNA (sRNA)-seq. The sRNA-seq data were analyzed using various bioinformatic tools. Validation of key exmiRNA was performed using specific TaqMan microRNA stem-loop RT-qPCR assays. Results: We investigated the effect of cART, THC, or both cART and THC together on the abundance and compartmentalization of blood plasma exmiRNA in EVs and ECs in SIV-infected RMs. As shown in Manuscript 1 of this series, were in uninfected RMs, ~30% of exmiRNAs were associated with ECs, we confirmed in this follow up manuscript that exmiRNAs were present in both lipid-based carriers-EVs and non-lipid-based carriers-ECs, with 29.5 to 35.6% and 64.2 to 70.5 % being associated with EVs and ECs, respectively. Remarkably, the different treatments (cART, THC) have distinct effects on the enrichment and compartmentalization pattern of exmiRNAs. In the VEH/SIV/cART group, 12 EV-associated and 15 EC-associated miRNAs were significantly downregulated. EV-associated miR-206, a muscle-specific miRNA that is present in blood, was higher in the VEH/SIV/ART compared to the VEH/SIV group. ExmiR-139-5p that was implicated in endocrine resistance, focal adhesion, lipid and atherosclerosis, apoptosis, and breast cancer by miRNA-target enrichment analysis was significantly lower in VEH/SIV/cART compared to VEH/SIV, irrespective of the compartment. With respect to THC treatment, 5 EV-associated and 21 EC-associated miRNAs were significantly lower in the VEH/THC/SIV. EV-associated miR-99a-5p was higher in VEH/THC/SIV compared to VEH/SIV, while miR-335-5p counts were significantly lower in both EVs and ECs of THC/SIV compared to VEH/SIV. EVs from SIV/cART/THC combined treatment group have significant increases in the count of eight (miR-186-5p, miR-382-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-652, miR-10a-5p, miR-657, miR-140-5p, miR-29c-3p) miRNAs, all of which were lower in VEH/SIV/cART group. Analysis of miRNA-target enrichment showed that this set of eight miRNAs were implicated in endocrine resistance, focal adhesions, lipid and atherosclerosis, apoptosis, and breast cancer as well as cocaine and amphetamine addiction. In ECs and EVs, combined THC and cART treatment significantly increased miR-139-5p counts compared to VEH/SIV group. Significant alterations in these host miRNAs in both EVs and ECs in the untreated and treated (cART, THC, or both) RMs indicate the persistence of host responses to infection or treatments, and this is despite cART suppression of viral load and THC suppression of inflammation. To gain further insight into the pattern of miRNA alterations in EVs and ECs and to assess potential cause-and-effect relationships, we performed longitudinal miRNA profile analysis, measured in terms of months (1 and 5) post-infection (MPI). We uncovered miRNA signatures associated with THC or cART treatment of SIV-infected macaques in both EVs and ECs. While the number of miRNAs was significantly higher in ECs relative to EVs for all groups (VEH/SIV, SIV/cART, THC/SIV, THC/SIV/cART, and THC) longitudinally from 1 MPI to 5 MPI, treatment with cART and THC have longitudinal effects on the abundance and compartmentalization pattern of exmiRNAs in the two carriers. As shown in Manuscript 1 where SIV infection led to longitudinal suppression of EV-associated miRNA-128-3p, administration of cART to SIV-infected RMs did not increase miR-128-3p but resulted in longitudinal increases in six EV-associated miRNAs (miR-484, miR-107, miR-206, miR-184, miR-1260b, miR-6132). Furthermore, administration of cART to THC treated SIV-infected RMs resulted in a longitudinal decrease in three EV-associated miRNAs (miR-342-3p, miR-100-5p, miR181b-5p) and a longitudinal increase in three EC-associated miRNAs (miR-676-3p, miR-574-3p, miR-505-5p). The longitudinally altered miRNAs in SIV-infected RMs may indicate disease progression, while in the cART Group and the THC Group, the longitudinally altered miRNAs may serve as biomarkers of response to treatment. Conclusions: This paired EVs and ECs miRNAome analyses provided a comprehensive cross-sectional and longitudinal summary of the host exmiRNA responses to SIV infection and the impact of THC, cART, or THC and cART together on the miRNAome during SIV infection. Overall, our data point to previously unrecognized alterations in the exmiRNA profile in blood plasma following SIV infection. Our data also indicate that cART and THC treatment independently and in combination may alter both the abundance and the compartmentalization of several exmiRNA related to various disease and biological processes.","2023","2023 Feb 24","Steven Kopcho; Marina McDew-White; Wasifa Naushad; Mahesh Mohan; Chioma M Okeoma","Department of Pharmacology, Stony Brook University Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook, NY 11794-8651, USA.; Host Pathogen Interaction Program, Southwest National Primate Research Center, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX 78227-5302, USA.; Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595-1524, USA.; Host Pathogen Interaction Program, Southwest National Primate Research Center, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX 78227-5302, USA.; Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595-1524, USA.; Lovelace Biomedical Institute, Albuquerque, NM 87108-5127, USA."

This study aimed to evaluate anti-HIV-1 activity and mechanism of action of WG-am. Drug sensitivity assays in TZM.bl cells, PBMCs and ACH-2 cells using WT and mutated HIV-1 strainswere performed to evaluate the antiviral mechanism of WG-am. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics and Real-time PCR analysis of reverse transcription steps were performed to unravel the second anti-HIV-1 mechanism of WG-am. The data suggest that WG-am binds to the CD4 binding pocket of HIV-1 gp120 and blocks its binding to the host cell receptors. Additionally, the time course assay showed that WG-am also inhibited HIV-1 at 4-6 hours post-infection, suggesting a second antiviral mechanism. Drug sensitivity assays under acidic wash conditions confirmed the ability of WG-am to internalise into the host cell in an HIV independent manner. Proteomic studies showed a clustering of all samples treated with WG-am independent of the number of doses or presence or absence of HIV-1. Differentially expressed proteins due to the WG-am treatment indicated an effect on HIV-1 reverse transcription, which was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Naturally occurring in HIV-1 elite controllers, WG-am stands out as a new kind of antiviral compound with two independent inhibitory mechanisms of action on HIV-1 replication. WG-am halts HIV-1 entry to the host cell by binding to HIV-1 gp120, thereby blocking the binding of HIV-1 to the host cell. WG-am also exerts a post-entry but pre-integration antiviral effect related to RT-activity.","2023","2023 May","Rafael Ceña-Diez; Aswathy Narayanan; Shilpa Ray; Maarten van de Klundert; Jimmy E Rodriguez; Johan Nilvebrant; Per-Åke Nygren; Ákos Végvári; Robert van Domselaar; Anders Sönnerborg","Division of Infectious Diseases, ANA Futura Laboratory, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

However, there have been few studies evaluating host genetic predictors of viral control for the majority of people living with HIV (PLWH) on ART. We performed host RNA sequencing and HIV reservoir quantification (total DNA, unspliced RNA, intact DNA) from peripheral CD4+ T cells from 191 HIV+ ART-suppressed non-controllers. Multivariate models included covariates for timing of ART initiation, nadir CD4+ count, age, sex, and ancestry. Lower HIV total DNA (an estimate of the total reservoir) was associated with upregulation of tumor suppressor genes NBL1 (q=0.012) and P3H3 (q=0.012). Higher HIV unspliced RNA (an estimate of residual HIV transcription) was associated with downregulation of several host genes involving inflammasome ( IL1A, CSF3, TNFAIP5, TNFAIP6, TNFAIP9 , CXCL3, CXCL10 ) and innate immune ( TLR7 ) signaling, as well as novel associations with potassium ( KCNJ2 ) and gap junction ( GJB2 ) channels, all q<0.05. Gene set enrichment analyses identified significant associations with TLR4/microbial translocation (q=0.006), IL-1β/NRLP3 inflammasome (q=0.008), and IL-10 (q=0.037) signaling. HIV intact DNA (an estimate of the ""replication-competent"" reservoir) demonstrated trends with thrombin degradation ( PLGLB1 ) and glucose metabolism ( AGL ) genes, but data were (HIV intact DNA detected in only 42% of participants). Our findings demonstrate that among treated PLWH, that inflammation, innate immune responses, bacterial translocation, and tumor suppression/cell proliferation host signaling play a key role in the maintenance of the HIV reservoir during ART. Further data are needed to validate these findings, including functional genomic studies, and expanded epidemiologic studies in female, non-European cohorts. Although lifelong HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses virus, the major barrier to an HIV cure is the persistence of infected cells that evade host immune surveillance despite effective ART, ""the HIV reservoir."" HIV eradication strategies have focused on eliminating residual virus to allow for HIV remission, but HIV cure trials to date have thus far failed to show a clinically meaningful reduction in the HIV reservoir. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the host-viral dynamics during ART suppression to identify potential novel therapeutic targets for HIV cure. This is the first epidemiologic host gene expression study to demonstrate a significant link between HIV reservoir size and several well-known immunologic pathways (e.g., IL-1β, TLR7, TNF-α signaling pathways), as well as novel associations with potassium and gap junction channels (Kir2.1, connexin 26). Further data are needed to validate these findings, including functional genomic studies and expanded epidemiologic studies in female, non-European cohorts.","2023","2023 Jan 12","Ashok K Dwivedi; David A Siegel; Cassandra Thanh; Rebecca Hoh; Kristen S Hobbs; Tony Pan; Erica A Gibson; Jeffrey Martin; Frederick Hecht; Christopher Pilcher; Jeffrey Milush; Michael P Busch; Mars Stone; Meei-Li Huang; Claire N Levy; Pavitra Roychoudhury; Florian Hladik; Keith R Jerome; Timothy J Henrich; Steven G Deeks; Sulggi A Lee",""

Cross-sectional genomewide association study. We analyzed custom whole exome sequencing and direct human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing from 202 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed HIV+ noncontrollers in relation to four measures of the peripheral CD4+ T-cell reservoir: HIV intact DNA, total (t)DNA, unspliced (us)RNA, and RNA/DNA. Linear mixed models were adjusted for potential covariates including age, sex, nadir CD4+ T-cell count, pre-ART HIV RNA, timing of ART initiation, and duration of ART suppression. Previously reported 'protective' host genetic mutations related to viral setpoint (e.g. among elite controllers) were found to predict smaller HIV reservoir size. The HLA 'protective' B∗57:01 was associated with significantly lower HIV usRNA (q = 3.3 × 10-3), and among the largest subgroup, European ancestry individuals, the CCR5Δ32 deletion was associated with smaller HIV tDNA (P = 4.3 × 10-3) and usRNA (P = 8.7 × 10-3). In addition, genomewide analysis identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms in MX1 (an interferon stimulated gene) that were significantly associated with HIV tDNA (q = 0.02), and the direction of these associations paralleled MX1 gene eQTL expression. We observed a significant association between previously reported 'protective' MHC class I alleles and CCR5Δ32 with the HIV reservoir size in noncontrollers. We also found a novel association between MX1 and HIV total DNA (in addition to other interferon signaling relevant genes, PPP1CB, DDX3X).

Previous studies suggest that enhanced cytosolic immune recognition of HIV-1 reverse transcripts in conventional dendritic cells (mDC) from EC enables effective induction of antiviral effector T cell responses. However, the specific molecular circuits responsible for such improved innate recognition of HIV-1 in mDC from these individuals remain unknown. Here, we identified a subpopulation of EC whose mDC displayed higher baseline abilities to respond to intracellular HIV-1 dsDNA stimulation. A computational analysis of transcriptional signatures from such high responder EC, combined with functional studies, suggested cytosolic recognition of HIV-1 dsDNA by cGAS, combined with sensing of viral mRNA by RIG-I after polymerase III-mediated HIV-1 DNA transcription. Together, our work identifies collaborative networks of innate sensing pathways that enhance cell-intrinsic abilities of mDC to induce antiviral innate responses against HIV-1; these observations might be useful for the therapeutic induction of effective antiviral immune responses.","2022","2022","Enrique Martin-Gayo; Ce Gao; Marta Calvet-Mirabent; Zhengyu Ouyang; Mathias Lichterfeld; Xu G Yu","Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge, MA, United States.; Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Immunology Unit, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge, MA, United States.; Infectious Disease Divisions, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.; Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Immunology Unit, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge, MA, United States.; Infectious Disease Divisions, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge, MA, United States.; Infectious Disease Divisions, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge, MA, United States.; Infectious Disease Divisions, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States."

Host genetic factors play a role in HIV-1 pathogenesis, but complete knowledge is not yet available. Since less-expressed HLA-C variants are associated with poor HIV-1 control and unstable HLA-C variants are associated with higher HIV-1 infectivity, we investigated whether there was a correlation between the different stages of HIV-1 progression and the presence of specific HLA-C allotypes. HLA-C genotyping was performed using allele-specific PCR by analyzing a treatment-naïve cohort of 96 HIV-1-infected patients from multicentric cohorts in the USA, Canada, and Brazil. HIV-1-positive subjects were classified according to their different disease progression status as progressors (Ps, n = 48), long-term non-progressors (LTNPs, n = 37), and elite controllers (ECs, n = 11). HLA-C variants were classified as stable or unstable according to their binding stability to β2-microglobulin/peptide complex. Our results showed a significant correlation between rapid progression to AIDS and the presence of two or one unstable HLA-C variants (p-value: 0.0078, p-value: 0.0143, respectively). These findings strongly suggest a link between unstable HLA-C variants both at genotype and at allele levels and rapid progression to AIDS.

Using a dual-reporter virus, we subsequently validate that in transitioning CD4+ T cells, Nutlin-3 treatment decreases the frequency of both productively and latently infected cells via upregulation of miRNA-103. Importantly, we provide evidence that CD4+ T cells from HIV-1 elite controllers express less CCR5 than those from antiretroviral therapy-naïve progressors, an effect linked to a significant increase in miRNA-103 levels.

Elite controllers exhibited stronger HIV-specific cytotoxic responses than the progressors, and their CD8+T cells showed a miRNA (hsa-miR-10a-5p) significantly downregulated. When we transfected ex vivo CD8+ T cells from progressors with a synthetic miR-10a-5p inhibitor, miR-10a-5p levels decreased in 4 out of 6 progressors, correlating with an increase in HIV-specific cytotoxic responses. The effects of miR-10a-5p inhibition on HIV-specific CTL responses were modest, short-lived, and occurred before day seven after modulation. IL-4 and TNF-α levels strongly correlated with HIV-specific cytotoxic capacity. Thus, inhibition of miR-10a-5p enhanced HIV-specific CD8+ T cell capacity in progressors.

This may be due to previously uncontrolled HIV viral replication, immune activation maintained by residual viral replication or activation from other sources, or cART-associated neurotoxicity. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cART on cognition and neuroimaging biomarkers in PWH before and after initiation of cART compared with that in HIV-negative controls (HCs) and HIV elite controllers (ECs) who remain untreated. We recruited 3 groups of participants from the University of Rochester, McGovern Medical School, and SUNY Upstate Medical University: (1) ART treatment-naive PWH; (2) age-matched HCs; and (3) ECs. Participants underwent brain MRI and clinical and neuropsychological assessments at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years. PWH were also assessed 12 weeks after initiating cART. Volumetric analysis and fractal dimensionality (FD) were calculated for cortical and subcortical regions. Mixed effect regressions examined the effect of group and imaging variables on cognition. We enrolled 47 PWH, 58 HCs, and 10 ECs. At baseline, PWH had worse cognition and lower cortical volumes than HCs. Cognition improved after initiation of cART and remained stable over time. Greater cortical thickness was associated with better cognition at baseline; greater FD of parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes was associated with better cognition at baseline and longitudinally. At baseline, ECs had worse cognition, lower cortical thickness, and lower FD in all 4 lobes and caudate than PWH and HCs. Greater cortical thickness, hippocampal volumes, and FD of frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes were associated with better cognition longitudinally. Initiation of cART in PWH is associated with improvement in brain structure and cognition. However, significant differences persist over time when compared with HCs. Similar trends in ECs suggest that results are due to HIV infection rather than treatment. Stronger associations between cognition and FD suggest this imaging metric may be a more sensitive marker of neuronal injury than cortical thickness and volumetric measures.","2022","2022 Sep 06","Miriam T Weber;

Ten non-controller patients on successful cART (TX) and seven elite controllers (EC) were included. HIV-Gag gene from purified resting memory CD4+ T-cells was sequenced by Next-Generation-Sequencing. HLA class-I alleles were typed to predict optimal HIV-Gag CTL epitopes. For each subject, the frequency of mutated epitopes in the HIV-Gag gene, the proportion of them considered as CTL-escape variants as well as their effect on antigen recognition by HLA were assessed. The proportion (%) of mutated HIV-Gag CTL epitopes in the reservoir was high and similar in EC and TX (86%[50-100] and 57%[48-82] respectively, p=0.315). Many of them were predicted to negatively impact antigen recognition. Moreover, the proportion of mutated epitopes considered to be CTL-escape variants was also similar in TX and EC (77%[49-92] vs. 50%[33-75] respectively, p=0.117). Thus, the most relevant finding of our study was the high and similar proportions of HIV-Gag CTL-escape mutations in the reservoir of both HIV-noncontroller patients with cART (TX) and patients with spontaneous HIV-control (EC). Our findings suggest that escape mutations of CTL-response may be another obstacle to eliminate the HIV reservoir and constitute a proof of concept that challenges HIV cure strategies focused on the reactivation of reservoirs. Due to the small sample size that could impact the robustness of the study, further studies with larger cohorts of elite controller patients are needed to confirm these results.","2022","2022 Dec","María A Navarrete-Muñoz; Ricardo Ramos; África Holguín; Alfonso Cabello; Miguel Górgolas; José M Benito; Norma Rallón","HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; Unidad de Genómica, Scientific Park of Madrid, Madrid, Spain.; HIV-1 Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory, Instituto Ramón y Cajal de Investigación Sanitaria(IRYCIS), Madrid, Spain.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Madrid, Spain.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Madrid, Spain.; HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain."

Long-term non progressors (LTNP) and elite controllers (EC) are low frequent examples of immunological and virological control in HIV-1 positive subjects, respectively. The combination of both phenotypes is even less frequent and studied despite being considered as models of HIV-1 functional cure. A multicenter, prospective study in retrospect including clinical and epidemiological data collected from 313 LTNP of 21 Spanish hospitals was carried out. LTNPs maintaining CD4+ T cell counts over 500 cells/µl and viral loads (VL) under 10,000 copies/mL for at least 10 years in the absence of antiretroviral therapy were followed for a median of 20.8 years (IQR = 15.6-25.5). A 52.1% were considered EC (undetectable VL) and LTNP (EC-LTNP) and a total of 171 (54.8%) and 42 (13.5%) out of the 313 participants maintained LTNP status for at least 20 and 30 years, respectively. EC-LTNP showed lower CD4+ T cell count loss (9.9 vs 24.2 cells/µl/year), higher CD4/CD8 ratio (0.01 vs - 0.09 in ratio), and lesser VL increase (no increase vs 197.2 copies/mL/year) compared with LTNPs with detectable VL (vLTNP). Survival probabilities for all-cause mortality at 30 years from HIV + diagnosis were 0.90 for EC-LTNP and 0.70 for vLTNP (p = 2.0 × 10-3), and EC-LTNP phenotype was the only factor associated with better survival in multivariate analyses (HR = 0.28; 95% CI 0.10-0.79). The probability to preserve LTNP status at 30 years was 0.51 for EC-LTNP and 0.18 for vLTNP (p < 2.2 × 10-16). Risk factors associated to the loss of LTNP status was: higher age at diagnosis and the increase of VL, whereas the increase of CD4+ T cell counts and CD4/CD8 ratio, the initial EC-LTNP phenotype and HCV coinfection were protective factors. EC-LTNP phenotype was associated with improved survival and slower disease progression compared with other phenotypes of LTNP. EC-LTNP individuals represent one of the most favorable phenotypes of immune activation against HIV-1 found in nature and, therefore, are strong candidates to be considered a model of functional cure of HIV-1 infection.","2022","2022 Sep 29","Laura Capa; Rubén Ayala-Suárez; Humberto Erick De La Torre Tarazona; Juan González-García; Jorge Del Romero; José Alcamí; Francisco Díez-Fuertes","AIDS Immunopathogenesis Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain. lcapa@isciii.es.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CIBERINFEC), Madrid, Spain. lcapa@isciii.es.; AIDS Immunopathogenesis Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CIBERINFEC), Madrid, Spain.; Departamento de Biomedicina y Biotecnología, Universidad de Alcalá, Alcalá de Henares, Spain.; AIDS Immunopathogenesis Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CIBERINFEC), Madrid, Spain.; Unidad de VIH, Servicio de Medicina Interna, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Idipaz, Madrid, Spain.; Centro Sanitario Sandoval, Hospital Clínico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain.; AIDS Immunopathogenesis Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain. ppalcami@isciii.es.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CIBERINFEC), Madrid, Spain. ppalcami@isciii.es.; Infectious Diseases Unit, IBIDAPS, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. ppalcami@isciii.es.; AIDS Immunopathogenesis Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain. fdiezf@isciii.es.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CIBERINFEC), Madrid, Spain. fdiezf@isciii.es."

Subsets of FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells were characterized both prospectively and cross-sectionally in PBMCs from untreated acute (n=26) and chronic (n=10) HIV-infected individuals, early ART-treated in acute infection (n=10, median of ART initiation: 5.5 months post-infection), ART-treated in chronic infection (n=10), elite controllers (n=18), and HIV-uninfected controls (n=21). Acute and chronic infection were associated with increased total, effector memory, and terminally differentiated FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells, while early ART normalized only the frequencies of total FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells. We observed an increase in FoxP3+ CD8 T-cell immune activation (HLADR+/CD38+), senescence (CD57+/CD28-), and PD-1 expression during acute and chronic infection, which were not normalized by early ART. FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells in untreated participants expressed higher levels of immunosuppressive LAP(TGF-β1) and CD39 than uninfected controls, whereas early ART did not affect their expression. The expression of gut-homing markers CCR9 and Integrin-β7 by total FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells and CD39+ and LAP(TGF-β1)+ FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells increased in untreated individuals and remained higher than in uninfected controls despite early ART.

More recently, the importance of cellular metabolism in shaping T cell antiviral function has emerged as a crucial aspect of immunotherapeutics aimed at re-invigorating exhausted CD8 T cells but remains under-investigated in HIV-1 infection. To gain a better insight into this process and identify new targets for effective CD8 T cell restoration we examined the metabolic profile of exhausted CD8 T cells in HIV-1 infection. We show that relative to HIV-1 elite controllers (EC) and HIV-1 seronegative donors, CD8 T cells from HIV-1 viraemic individuals are skewed toward a PD-1hiEOMEShiT-betlowTIGIT+ phenotype that is maintained during ART. This exhausted signature is enriched in HIV-specific CD8 T cells, compared to CMV-specific CD8 T cell populations, and further delineated by higher expression of the glucose transporter, Glut-1, impaired mitochondrial function and biogenesis, reflecting underlying metabolic defects. A notable improvement in antiviral HIV-specific CD8 T cell function was elicited via mitochondrial antioxidant treatment in combination with pharmacological modulation of mitochondrial dynamics and IL-15 treatment. These findings identify mitochondria as promising targets for combined reconstitution therapies in HIV-1 infection.","2022","2022","Aljawharah Alrubayyi; Elia Moreno-Cubero; Dan Hameiri-Bowen; Rebecca Matthews; Sarah Rowland-Jones; Anna Schurich; Dimitra Peppa","Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London (UCL), London, United Kingdom.; Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Mortimer Market Centre, Department of HIV, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom."

These individuals express specific human leukocyte antigens (HLA) that tag HIV-infected cells for elimination by presenting viral epitopes to CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL). In HIV-infected individuals expressing HLA-B27, CTLs primarily target the viral capsid protein (CA)-derived KK10 epitope. While selection of CA mutation R264K helps HIV-1 escape this potent CTL response, the accompanying fitness cost severely diminishes virus infectivity. Interestingly, selection of a compensatory CA mutation S173A restores HIV-1 replication. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying HIV-1 escape from this ART-free virus control by CTLs is not fully understood. Here, we report that the R264K mutation-associated infectivity defect arises primarily from impaired HIV-1 DNA integration, which is restored by the S173A mutation. Unexpectedly, the integration defect of the R264K variant was also restored upon depletion of the host cyclophilin A. These findings reveal a nuclear crosstalk between CA and HIV-1 integration as well as identify a previously unknown role of cyclophilin A in viral DNA integration. Finally, our study identifies a novel immune escape mechanism of an HIV-1 variant escaping a CA-directed CTL response.","2022","2022 May","Muthukumar Balasubramaniam; Benem-Orom Davids; Alex Bryer; Chaoyi Xu; Santosh Thapa; Jiong Shi; Christopher Aiken; Jui Pandhare; Juan R Perilla; Chandravanu Dash","The Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN - 37208, USA.; The Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN - 37208, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of Delaware, Newark, DE - 19716, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of Delaware, Newark, DE - 19716, USA.; The Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN - 37208, USA.; Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN - 37232, USA.; Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN - 37232, USA.; The Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN - 37208, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of Delaware, Newark, DE - 19716, USA.; The Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN - 37208, USA."

Here, we assessed TDP-43 activity in terms of regulating CD4+ T-cell permissivity to HIV-1 infection. We observed that overexpression of wt-TDP-43 increased both mRNA and protein levels of HDAC6, resulting in impaired HIV-1 infection independently of the viral envelope glycoprotein complex (Env) tropism. Consistently, using an HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-to-cell fusion model, the overexpression of TDP-43 levels negatively affected viral Env fusion capacity. Silencing of endogenous TDP-43 significantly decreased HDAC6 levels and increased the fusogenic and infection activities of the HIV-1 Env. Using pseudovirus bearing primary viral Envs from HIV-1 individuals, overexpression of wt-TDP-43 strongly reduced the infection activity of Envs from viremic non-progressors (VNP) and rapid progressors (RP) patients down to the levels of the inefficient HIV-1 Envs observed in long-term non-progressor elite controllers (LTNP-EC). On the contrary, silencing endogenous TDP-43 significantly favored the infectivity of primary Envs from VNP and RP individuals, and notably increased the infection of those from LTNP-EC. Taken together, our results indicate that TDP-43 shapes cell permissivity to HIV-1 infection, affecting viral Env fusion and infection capacities by altering the HDAC6 levels and associated tubulin-deacetylase anti-HIV-1 activity.","2022","2022 May 31","Romina Cabrera-Rodríguez; Silvia Pérez-Yanes; Rafaela Montelongo; José M Lorenzo-Salazar; Judith Estévez-Herrera; Jonay García-Luis; Antonio Íñigo-Campos; Luis A Rubio-Rodríguez; Adrián Muñoz-Barrera; Rodrigo Trujillo-González; Roberto Dorta-Guerra; Concha Casado; María Pernas; Julià Blanco; Carlos Flores; Agustín Valenzuela-Fernández","Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), 38320 La Laguna, Spain.; Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), 38320 La Laguna, Spain.; Genomics Division, Instituto Tecnológico y de Energías Renovables, 38600 Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.; Genomics Division, Instituto Tecnológico y de Energías Renovables, 38600 Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.; Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), 38320 La Laguna, Spain.; Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), 38320 La Laguna, Spain.; Genomics Division, Instituto Tecnológico y de Energías Renovables, 38600 Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.; Genomics Division, Instituto Tecnológico y de Energías Renovables, 38600 Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.; Genomics Division, Instituto Tecnológico y de Energías Renovables, 38600 Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.; Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), 38320 La Laguna, Spain.; Analysis Department, Faculty of Mathematics, Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), 38296 La Laguna, Spain.; Mathematics, Statistics and Operations Research, Faculty of Mathematics, Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), 38320 La Laguna, Spain.; Unidad de Virología Molecular, LRIR, Centro Nacional de Microbiología (CNM), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28029 Madrid, Spain.; Unidad de Virología Molecular, LRIR, Centro Nacional de Microbiología (CNM), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28029 Madrid, Spain.; AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Institut de Recerca en Ciències de la Salut Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), 08916 Badalona, Spain.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia (UVic-UCC), 08500 Barcelona, Spain.; Genomics Division, Instituto Tecnológico y de Energías Renovables, 38600 Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.; Research Unit, Hospital Universitario N.

Single-cell transcriptomic profiles revealed that circulating MAIT cells from HIV-1 infected subjects were highly activated, with upregulation of pyroptosis-related genes. Further analysis revealed that increased frequencies of pyroptotic MAIT cells correlated with markers of systemic T-cell activation, microbial translocation, and intestinal damage in cART-naive patients and poor CD4+ T-cell recovery in long-term cART patients. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that MAIT cells in the gut mucosa of HIV-1 infected patients exhibited a strong active gasdermin-D (GSDMD, marker of pyroptosis) signal near the cavity side, suggesting that these MAIT cells underwent active pyroptosis in the colorectal mucosa. Increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-18 were observed in HIV-1 infected patients. In addition, activated MAIT cells exhibited an increased pyroptotic phenotype after being triggered by HIV-1 virions, T-cell receptor signals, IL-12 plus IL-18, and combinations of these factors, in vitro. Activation-induced MAIT cell pyroptosis contributes to the loss of MAIT cells in HIV-1 infected patients, which could potentiate disease progression and poor immune reconstitution.","2022","2022 May 27","Peng Xia; Xu-Dong Xing; Cui-Xian Yang; Xue-Jiao Liao; Fu-Hua Liu; Hui-Huang Huang; Chao Zhang; Jin-Wen Song; Yan-Mei Jiao; Ming Shi; Tian-Jun Jiang; Chun-Bao Zhou; Xi-Cheng Wang; Qing He; Qing-Lei Zeng; Fu-Sheng Wang; Ji-Yuan Zhang","Senior Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China.; Department of Infectious Diseases and Hepatology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, China.; Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China.; Yunnan Infectious Disease Hospital, Kunming, 650301, China.; the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, 518112, Guangzhou, China.; Senior Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China.; Department of Infectious Diseases and Hepatology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, China.; Senior Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China.; Senior Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China.; Senior Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China.; Senior Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China.; Senior Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China.; Senior Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China.; Senior Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China.; Yunnan Infectious Disease Hospital, Kunming, 650301, China.; the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, 518112, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Infectious Diseases and Hepatology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, China. zengqinglei2009@163.com.; Senior Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China. fswang302@163.com.; Senior Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China. uniquezjy@163.com."

The ectonucleotidase CD39 is part of the purinergic pathway that regulates immune responses by degradation of pro-inflammatory ATP in concert with CD73. Few studies on the expression of the ectoenzymes CD73 and CD39 on human γδ T cells in HIV have been performed to date. PBMC of n=86 HIV-1-infected patients were compared to PBMC of n=26 healthy individuals using 16-color flow cytometry determining the surface expression of CD39 and CD73 on Vδ1 and Vδ2 T cells in association with differentiation (CD45RA, CD28, CD27), activation and exhaustion (TIGIT, PD-1, CD38, and HLA-DR), and assessing the intracellular production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, TGF-ß, TNF-α, Granzyme B, IL-10, IFN-γ) after in vitro stimulation with PMA/ionomycin. CD39 and CD73 expression on γδ T cells were inversed in HIV infection which correlated with HIV disease progression and immune activation. CD39, but not CD73 expression on γδ T cells of ART-treated patients returned to levels comparable with those of healthy individuals. Only a small subset (<1%) of γδ T cells co-expressed CD39 and CD73 in healthy or HIV-infected individuals. There were significantly more exhausted and terminally differentiated CD39+ Vδ1 T cells regardless of the disease status. Functionally, IL-10 was only detectable in CD39+ γδ T cells after in vitro stimulation in all groups studied. Viremic HIV-infected patients showed the highest levels of IL-10 production. The highest percentage of IL-10+ cells was found in the small CD39/CD73 co-expressing γδ T-cell population, both in healthy and HIV-infected individuals. Also, CD39+ Vδ2 T cells produced IL-10 more frequently than their CD39+ Vδ1 counterparts in all individuals regardless of the HIV status. Our results point towards a potential immunomodulatory role of CD39+ and CD73+ γδ T cells in the pathogenesis of chronic HIV infection that needs further investigation.","2022","2022","Katharina Kolbe; Melanie Wittner; Philip Hartjen; Anja-Dorothee Hüfner; Olaf Degen; Christin Ackermann; Leon Cords; Hans-Jürgen Stellbrink; Friedrich Haag; Julian Schulze Zur Wiesch","First Department of Medicine, Section Infectious Diseases, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Hamburg Lübeck Borstel Riems, Hamburg, Germany.; First Department of Medicine, Section Infectious Diseases, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Hamburg Lübeck Borstel Riems, Hamburg, Germany.; First Department of Medicine, Section Infectious Diseases, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; First Department of Medicine, Section Infectious Diseases, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; Infectious Diseases Clinic, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; First Department of Medicine, Section Infectious Diseases, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; Infectious Diseases Clinic, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; First Department of Medicine, Section Infectious Diseases, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; First Department of Medicine, Section Infectious Diseases, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; ICH Study Center, Hamburg, Germany.; Institute of Immunology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; First Department of Medicine, Section Infectious Diseases, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Hamburg Lübeck Borstel Riems, Hamburg, Germany."

However, data on the LTEC phenotype are still scarce, and hence, the metabolomics and lipidomics signatures in the LTEC-extreme phenotype, LTECs with more than 10 years of viral and immunological HIV control, could be pivotal to finding the keys for functional HIV remission. Metabolomics and lipidomics analyses were performed using high-resolution mass spectrometry (ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole time of flight [UHPLC-(ESI) qTOF] in plasma samples of 13 patients defined as LTEC-extreme, a group of 20 LTECs that lost viral and/or immunological control during the follow-up study (LTEC-losing) and 9 EC patients with short-term viral and immunological control (less than 5 years; no-LTEC patients). Long-term viral and immunological HIV-1 control was found to be strongly associated with elevated tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function. Interestingly, of the nine metabolites identified in the TCA cycle, α-ketoglutaric acid (p = 0.004), a metabolite implicated in the activation of the mTOR complex, a modulator of HIV latency and regulator of several biological processes, was found to be a key metabolite in the persistent control. On the other hand, a lipidomics panel combining 45 lipid species showed an optimal percentage of separation and an ability to differentiate LTEC-extreme from LTEC-losing, revealing that an elevated lipidomics plasma profile could be a predictive factor for the reignition of viral replication in LTEC individuals.","2022","2022","Jenifer Masip; Norma Rallón; Elena Yeregui; Montserrat Olona; Salvador Resino; José M Benito; Consuelo Viladés; Graciano García-Pardo; José Alcamí; Ezequiel Ruiz-Mateos; Frederic Gómez-Bertomeu; Montserrat Vargas; Marta Navarro; José A Oteo; Juan A Pineda; Anna Martí; Verónica Alba; Francesc Vidal; Joaquin Peraire; Anna Rull","Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Institut Investigació Sanitària Pere Virgili (IISPV), Tarragona, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.; HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; Institut Investigació Sanitària Pere Virgili (IISPV), Tarragona, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.; Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Institut Investigació Sanitària Pere Virgili (IISPV), Tarragona, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.; Unidad de Infección Viral e Inmunidad, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CIBERINFEC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain.; HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Institut Investigació Sanitària Pere Virgili (IISPV), Tarragona, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CIBERINFEC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain.; Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Institut Investigació Sanitària Pere Virgili (IISPV), Tarragona, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CIBERINFEC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain.; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, AIDS Immunopathology Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Madrid, Spain.; HIV Unit, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.; Clinical Unit of Infectious Diseases, Microbiology and Preventive Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine of Seville (IBiS), Virgen del Rocío University Hospital, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC), University of Seville, Seville, Spain.; Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.; Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.; Servicio de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Parc Tauli Hospital Universitari, Sabadell, Spain.; Hospital Universitario San Pedro, Centro de Investigación Biomédica de La Rioja (CIBIR), Logroño, Spain.; Unidad de Investigación Hospital Universitario de Valme, Sevilla, Spain.; Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Institut Investigació Sanitària Pere Virgili (IISPV), Tarragona, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.; Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Institut Investigació Sanitària Pere Virgili (IISPV), Tarragona, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.; Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Institut Investigació Sanitària Pere Virgili (IISPV), Tarragona, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CIBERINFEC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain.; Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Institut Investigació Sanitària Pere Virgili (IISPV), Tarragona, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CIBERINFEC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain.; Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Institut Investigació Sanitària Pere Virgili (IISPV), Tarragona, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CIBERINFEC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain."

Since immune activation/inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), we evaluated clinical data and inflammation markers in HIV-1 viremic controllers (VC), elite controllers (EC), and control groups (HIV positive individuals with virological suppression by antiretroviral therapy-cART; HIV negative individuals-HIVneg) to assess whether they presented elevated levels of inflammation markers also associated with CVD. We observed the highest frequencies of activated CD8+ T cells in VCs, while EC and cART groups presented similar but slightly altered frequencies of this marker when compared to the HIVneg group. Regarding platelet activation, both HICs groups presented higher expression of P-selectin in platelets when compared to control groups. Monocyte subset analyses revealed lower frequencies of classical monocytes and increased frequencies of non-classical and intermediate monocytes among cART individuals and in EC when compared to HIV negative individuals, but none of the differences were significant. For VC, however, significant decreases in frequencies of classical monocytes and increases in the frequency of intermediate monocytes were observed in comparison to HIV negative individuals. The frequency of monocytes expressing tissue factor was similar among the groups on all subsets. In terms of plasma markers, VC had higher levels of many inflammatory markers, while EC had higher levels of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 compared to control groups. Our data showed that VCs display increased levels of inflammation markers that have been associated with CVD risk.

Expression of CCR2 was reduced on both CD4+, CD8+ and classical monocytes in PLWHEC compared to PLWHART and HC. Longer suppressive therapy, measured in the same patients, decreased number of cells expressing CCR2 on all monocytic cell populations while expression on CD8+ T cells increased. Furthermore, the CD4+CCR6+/CCR6- cells exhibited a unique proteomic profile with a modulated energy metabolism in PLWHEC compared to PLWHART independent of CCR6 status. The CD4+CCR6+ cells also showed an enrichment in proteins involved in apoptosis and p53 signalling in PLWHEC compared to PLWHART, indicative of increased sensitivity towards cell death mechanisms.

The involvement of viral factors has been investigated in extreme clinical phenotypes from rapid progressors to long-term non-progressors (LTNPs). Among HIV-1 proteins, the envelope glycoprotein complex (Env) has been concentrated on in many studies for its important role in the immune response and in the first steps of viral replication. In this study, we analyzed the contribution of 41 Envs from 24 patients with different clinical progression rates and viral loads (VLs), LTNP-Elite Controllers (LTNP-ECs); Viremic LTNPs (vLTNPs), and non-controller individuals contemporary to LTNPs or recent, named Old and Modern progressors. We studied the Env expression, the fusion and cell-to-cell transfer capacities, as well as viral infectivity. The sequence and phylogenetic analysis of Envs were also performed. In every functional characteristic, the Envs from subjects with viral control (LTNP-ECs and vLTNPs) showed significant lower performance compared to those from the progressor individuals (Old and Modern). Regarding sequence analysis, the variable loops of the gp120 subunit of the Env (i.e., V2, V4, and mainly V5) of the progressor individuals showed longer and more glycosylated sequences than controller subjects. Therefore, HIV-1 Envs from virus of patients presenting viremic control and the non-progressor clinical phenotype showed poor viral functions and shorter sequences, whereas functional Envs were associated with virus of patients lacking virological control and with progressor clinical phenotypes. These correlations support the role of Env genotypic and phenotypic characteristics in the in vivo HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis.","2022","2022","Silvia Pérez-Yanes; María Pernas; Silvia Marfil; Romina Cabrera-Rodríguez; Raquel Ortiz; Víctor Urrea; Carla Rovirosa; Judith Estévez-Herrera; Isabel Olivares; Concepción Casado; Cecilio Lopez-Galindez; Julià Blanco; Agustín Valenzuela-Fernández","Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), San Cristóbal de La Laguna, Spain.; Unidad de Virologia Molecular, Laboratorio de Referencia e Investigación en Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiologia, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; Institut de Recerca de la Sida IrsiCaixa, Institut d'Investigació en Ciències de la Salut Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Barcelona, Spain.; Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), San Cristóbal de La Laguna, Spain.; Institut de Recerca de la Sida IrsiCaixa, Institut d'Investigació en Ciències de la Salut Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Barcelona, Spain.; Institut de Recerca de la Sida IrsiCaixa, Institut d'Investigació en Ciències de la Salut Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Barcelona, Spain.; Institut de Recerca de la Sida IrsiCaixa, Institut d'Investigació en Ciències de la Salut Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Barcelona, Spain.; Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), San Cristóbal de La Laguna, Spain.; Unidad de Virologia Molecular, Laboratorio de Referencia e Investigación en Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiologia, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; Unidad de Virologia Molecular, Laboratorio de Referencia e Investigación en Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiologia, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; Unidad de Virologia Molecular, Laboratorio de Referencia e Investigación en Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiologia, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; Institut de Recerca de la Sida IrsiCaixa, Institut d'Investigació en Ciències de la Salut Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Barcelona, Spain.; Chair of Infectious Diseases and Immunity, Faculty of Medicine, Universitat de Vic-Universitat Central de Catalunya (UVic-UCC), Barcelona, Spain.; Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), San Cristóbal de La Laguna, Spain."

Our aim was therefore to evaluate the anti-HIV-1 activity of a new set of antivirals, dipeptides (WG-am or VQ-am) combined with a single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssON). The dipeptides were identified as naturally occurring and enriched in feces and systemic circulation in HIV-1-infected elite controllers and were proposed to act as entry inhibitors by binding to HIV-1 gp120. The ssON is DNA 35-mer, stabilized by phosphorothioate modifications, which acts on the endocytic step by binding to cell host receptors and inhibiting viruses through interference with binding to nucleolin. Chou-Talalay's Combination Index method for quantifying synergism was used to evaluate the drug combinations. Patient-derived chimeric viruses encoding the gp120 (env region) were produced by transient transfection and used to evaluate the antiviral profile of the combinations by drug susceptibility assays. We found that the combination WG-am:ssON or VQ-am:ssON had low combination index values, suggesting strong antiviral synergism. Of the two combinations, WG-am:ssON (1 mM:1 μM) had high efficacy against all prototype or patient-derived HIV-1 isolates tested, independent of subtype including the HIV-1-A6 sub-subtype. In addition, the antiviral effect was independent of co-receptor usage in patient-derived strains. WG-am and ssON alone significantly inhibited HIV-1 replication regardless of viral subtype and co-receptor usage, and the combination WG-am:ssON (1 mM:1 μM) was even more effective due to synergism.","2022","2022 Jun","Rafael Ceña-Diez; Kamalendra Singh; Anna-Lena Spetz; Anders Sönnerborg","Division of Infectious Diseases/ANA Futura, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Alfred Nobels Allé 8, 141 52, Huddinge, Sweden. rafael.cena.diez@ki.se.; Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA.; Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA.; Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Molecular Biosciences, Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Infectious Diseases/ANA Futura, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Alfred Nobels Allé 8, 141 52, Huddinge, Sweden.; Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA.; Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."

We aimed to identify plasma biomarkers associated with loss of spontaneous HIV-1 control in long-term elite controllers (HIV-LTECs). We performed a retrospective study in 60 HIV-LTECs [36 true-LTECs and 24 LTECs losing control (LTECs-LC)]. We selected a plasma sample from true-LTECs (towards the middle of the follow-up period) and two samples from LTECs-LC (one far from the loss of control and another close to loss of control). Plasma biomarkers were evaluated using multiplex immunoassays. The partial least squares-discriminant analysis provided the variable importance in projection (VIP), and the adjusted Generalized Linear Model provided the adjusted arithmetic mean ratio (aAMR). At the moment of the first LTECs-LC samples, the only plasma biomarker with a VIP≥1.5 was sTNF-R1, which showed higher values in LTECs-LC than true-LTECs [aAMR=1.62 (95%CI=1.20-2.19); p=0.001]. After a median of 3.9 (IQR=4.5) years of follow-up from the first sample, we also had access to a second plasma sample from 10 LTECs-LC patients. At the moment of this second LTECs-LC sample, the only plasma biomarker with VIP≥1.5 was also sTNF-R1, which showed higher values in LTECs-LC than true-LTECs [aAMR=1.93 (95%CI=1.41-2.65); p<0.001]. The difference between the first and second samples of LTECs-LC was significant (Δx= 6.58 (95%=0.3; 12.88); p=0.040). In conclusion, high plasma values of sTNF-R1 appear to discriminate HIV-LTECs that lose the natural control of HIV-1, helping to define a specific phenotype that may be useful for the clinical management of these patients.","2022","2022","Daniel Sepúlveda-Crespo; Norma Rallón; María José Muñoz-Gómez; Oscar Brochado-Kith; José Luis Jiménez; María Ángeles Muñoz-Fernández; José M Benito; Salvador Resino","Unidad de Infección Viral e Inmunidad, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Spain.; HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; Unidad de Infección Viral e Inmunidad, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Spain.; Unidad de Infección Viral e Inmunidad, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Spain.; Plataforma de Laboratorio, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón (HGUGM), Madrid, Spain.; Spanish HIV HGM Biobank, Madrid, Spain.; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria del Gregorio Marañón (IiSGM), Madrid, Spain.; Plataforma de Laboratorio, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón (HGUGM), Madrid, Spain.; Spanish HIV HGM Biobank, Madrid, Spain.; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria del Gregorio Marañón (IiSGM), Madrid, Spain.; Sección Inmunología, Laboratorio InmunoBiología Molecular, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón (HGUGM), Madrid, Spain.; HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; Unidad de Infección Viral e Inmunidad, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Spain."

Extracellular acyl coenzyme A binding protein (ACBP) acts as a feedback inhibitor of autophagy. Herein, we assessed the circulating ACBP levels in ECs, compared to people living with HIV (PLWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) or not. We found lower ACBP levels in ECs compared to ART-naïve or ART-treated PLWH (p < 0.01 for both comparisons), independently of age and sex. ACBP levels were similar in ECs and HIV-uninfected controls. The expression of the protective HLA alleles HLA-B*27, *57, or *58 did not influence ACBP levels in ECs. ACBP levels were not associated with CD4 or CD8 T-cell counts, CD4 loss over time, inflammatory cytokines, or anti-CMV IgG titers in ECs. In ART-treated PLWH, ACBP levels were correlated with interleukin (IL)-1β levels, but not with other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-32, or TNF-α. In conclusion, ECs are characterized by low ACBP plasma levels compared to ART-naïve or ART-treated PLWH. As autophagy is key to anti-HIV CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, the ACBP pathway constitutes an interesting target in HIV cure strategies.","2022","2022 Feb 23","Stéphane Isnard; Léna Royston; John Lin; Brandon Fombuena; Simeng Bu; Sanket Kant; Tsoarello Mabanga; Carolina Berini; Mohamed El-Far; Madeleine Durand; Cécile L Tremblay; Nicole F Bernard; Guido Kroemer; Jean-Pierre Routy","Infectious Disease and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; CIHR Canadian HIV Trials Network, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada.; Infectious Disease and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; CIHR Canadian HIV Trials Network, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Geneva University Hospitals, 1205 Geneva, Switzerland.; Infectious Disease and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Infectious Disease and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Infectious Disease and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Infectious Disease and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.; Infectious Disease and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Infectious Disease and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), CONICET-Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires C1121ABG, Argentina.; Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC H2X 0A9, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC H2X 0A9, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC H2X 0A9, Canada.; Département de Microbiologie, Immunologie et Infectiologie, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC H3T 1J4, Canada.; Infectious Disease and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Département de Microbiologie, Immunologie et Infectiologie, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC H3T 1J4, Canada.; Division of Clinical Immunology, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.; Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Equipe labellisée par la Ligue Contre le Cancer, Université de Paris, Sorbonne Université, Inserm U1138, Institut Universitaire de France, 75006 Paris, France.; Metabolomics and Cell Biology Platforms, Institut Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.; Department of Biology, Institut du Cancer Paris CARPEM, Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou, AP-HP, 75015 Paris, France.; Infectious Disease and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 4J1, Canada.; Division of Hematology, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada."

The antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediating anti-HIV antibodies have shown an association with HIV control. We assessed if such antibodies can be generated in vitro and whether the generated antibodies can facilitate the reduction of reactivated HIV reservoir. We isolated HIV-1-gp140-specific memory B cells from HIV-1-infected long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) with or without plasma ADCC and cultured them to generate anti-HIV antibodies. The ability of the generated antibodies to mediate ADCC and facilitate NK cell-mediated lysis of reactivated HIV reservoir was assessed by the rapid fluorometric antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assay and a flow-based novel latency reduction assay, respectively. All LTNPs showed the presence of gp140-specific memory B cells [median: 0.79% (0.54%-1.225%)], which were successfully differentiated into plasma cells [median 72.0% (68.7-82.2%)] in an in-vitro culture and secreted antibodies [median OD: 0.253 (0.205-0.274)]. The HIV-gp140-specific antibodies were generated from 11/13 LTNPs irrespective of their plasma ADCC status. The generated antibodies from LTNPs with plasma ADCC showed higher ADCC potency (median: 37.6%, IQR: 32.95%-51%) and higher reduction in reactivated HIV reservoir (median: 62.5%, IQR: 58.71%-64.92%) as compared with the antibodies generated from LTNPs without plasma ADCC (ADCC: median: 8.85%, IQR: 8%-9.7%; and % p24 reduction median: 13.84, IQR: 9.863%-17.81%). The potency of these antibodies to reduce latent reservoir was two-fold higher than the respective plasma ADCC. The study showed that the potent ADCC-mediating antibodies could be generated from memory B cells of the LTNPs with plasma ADCC activity. These antibodies also showed potent ability to facilitate NK cell-mediated lysis of reactivated HIV reservoirs. It also indicated that memory B cells from individuals with plasma ADCC activity should be preferentially used for such antibody generation. The important role of these antibodies in the reduction of latent reservoirs needs to be further evaluated as a useful strategy to obtain a functional cure for HIV infection.","2022","2022","Jayshree R Dhande; Rajani D Bagul; Madhuri R Thakar","ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute, Pune, India.; ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute, Pune, India.; ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute, Pune, India."

HIV-1 integration sites are highly biased towards actively transcribed genes, likely mediated by binding of the IN protein to specific host factors, particularly LEDGF, located at these gene regions. We here report a substantial redirection of integration site distribution induced by a single point mutation in HIV-1 IN. Viruses carrying the K258R IN mutation exhibit a high frequency of integrations into centromeric alpha satellite repeat sequences, as assessed by deep sequencing, a more than 10-fold increase over wild-type. Quantitative PCR and in situ immunofluorescence assays confirm this bias of the K258R mutant virus for integration into centromeric DNA. Immunoprecipitation studies identify host factors binding to IN that may account for the observed bias for integration into centromeres. Centromeric integration events are known to be enriched in the latent reservoir of infected memory T cells, as well as in elite controllers who limit viral replication without intervention. The K258R point mutation in HIV-1 IN is also present in databases of latent proviruses found in patients, and may reflect an unappreciated aspect of the establishment of viral latency.","2022","2022 Mar 18","Shelby Winans; Hyun Jae Yu; Kenia de Los Santos; Gary Z Wang; Vineet N KewalRamani; Stephen P Goff","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Basic Science Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick National Laboratory, Frederick, MD, USA.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Pathology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.; Basic Research Laboratory, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. spg1@cumc.columbia.edu.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. spg1@cumc.columbia.edu.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. spg1@cumc.columbia.edu."

The 2.8-Å resolution cryo-EM structure of 7-269-BG505 SOSIP.664 complex showed a similar pose as 2G12, on an epitope mainly composed of sugar residues comprising the N332 and N295 glycans. Binding and cryo-EM structural analyses showed that antibodies from the two other lineages interact mostly with glycans N332 and N386.

However, little is known about the features of these effector cells from people living with HIV (PLWH), particularly from those who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) during acute infection. Our study design was to use 42-parameter CyTOF to conduct deep phenotyping of paired blood- and lymph node (LN)-derived T and NK cells from three groups of HIV+ aviremic individuals: elite controllers (N = 5), and ART-suppressed individuals who had started therapy during chronic (N = 6) vs. acute infection (N = 8), the latter of which is associated with better outcomes. We found that acute-treated individuals are enriched for specific subsets of T and NK cells, including blood-derived CD56-CD16+ NK cells previously associated with HIV control, and LN-derived CD4+ T follicular helper cells with heightened expansion potential. An in-depth comparison of the features of the cells from blood vs. LNs of individuals from our cohort revealed that T cells from blood were more activated than those from LNs. By contrast, LNs were enriched for follicle-homing CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells, which expressed increased levels of inhibitory receptors and markers of survival and proliferation as compared to their CXCR5- counterparts. In addition, a subset of memory-like CD56brightTCF1+ NK cells was enriched in LNs relative to blood. These results together suggest unique T and NK cell features in acute-treated individuals, and highlight the importance of examining effector cells not only in blood but also the lymphoid tissue compartment, where the reservoir mostly persists, and where these cells take on distinct phenotypic features.","2022","2022","Ashley F George; Xiaoyu Luo; Jason Neidleman; Rebecca Hoh; Poonam Vohra; Reuben Thomas; Min-Gyoung Shin; Madeline J Lee; Catherine A Blish; Steven G Deeks; Warner C Greene; Sulggi A Lee; Nadia R Roan","Gladstone Institute of Virology, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Department of Urology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Gladstone Institute of Virology, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Gladstone Institute of Virology, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Department of Urology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Department of Pathology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.; Program in Immunology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.; Program in Immunology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.; Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Gladstone Institute of Virology, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Departments of Medicine, and Microbiology & Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and the University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Gladstone Institute of Virology, San Francisco, CA, United States.; Department of Urology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States."

The aim of this work was to investigate (1) the presence of neuroinflammation in aviremic people with HIV (PWH) on therapy and in nontreated aviremic PWH (elite controllers [ECs]) using a translocator protein 18 kDa radioligand; (2) the relationship between neuroinflammation and cognitive function in aviremic PWH; and (3) the relationship between [11C]-PBR28 signal and quantitative MRI (qMRI) measures of brain tissue integrity such as T1 and T2 relaxation times (rts). [11C]-PBR28 (standard uptake value ratio, SUVR) images were generated in 36 participants (14 PWH, 6 ECs, and 16 healthy controls) using a statistically defined pseudoreference region. Group comparisons of [11C]-PBR28 SUVR were performed using region of interest-based and voxelwise analyses. The relationship between inflammation, qMRI measures, and cognitive function was studied. In region of interest analyses, ECs exhibited significantly lower [11C]-PBR28 signal in the thalamus, putamen, superior temporal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum compared with the PWH. In voxelwise analyses, differences were observed in the thalamus, precuneus cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, occipital cortex, cerebellum, and white matter (WM). [11C]-PBR28 signal in the WM and superior temporal gyrus was related to processing speed and selective attention in PWH. In a subset of PWH (n = 12), [11C]-PBR28 signal in the thalamus and WM regions was related to a decrease in T2 rt and to an increase in T1 rt suggesting a colocalization of increased glial metabolism, decrease in microstructural integrity, and iron accumulation. This study casts a new light onto the role of neuroinflammation and related microstructural alterations of HIV infection in the CNS and shows that ECs suppress neuroinflammation more effectively than PWH on therapy.","2022","2022 Mar","Hasan Sari; Riccardo Galbusera; Guillaume Bonnier; Yang Lin; Zeynab Alshelh; Angel Torrado-Carvajal; Shibani S Mukerji; Eva M Ratai; Rajesh T Gandhi; Jacqueline T Chu; Oluwaseun Akeju; Vwaire Orhurhu; Andrew N Salvatore; Janet Sherman; Douglas S Kwon; Bruce Walker; Bruce Rosen; Julie C Price; Lauren E Pollak; Marco L Loggia; Cristina Granziera","From the MGH/MIT/HMS Athinoula A.

How these HIV-specific cells avoid infection and depletion upon encounter with the virus remains incompletely understood. Ex vivo characterization of single Gag-specific CD4 + T cells reveals an advanced Th1 differentiation pattern in controllers, except for the CCR5 marker, which is downregulated compared to specific cells of treated patients. Accordingly, controller specific CD4 + T cells show decreased susceptibility to CCR5-dependent HIV entry. Two controllers carried biallelic mutations impairing CCR5 surface expression, indicating that in rare cases CCR5 downregulation can have a direct genetic cause. Increased expression of β-chemokine ligands upon high-avidity antigen/TCR interactions contributes to autocrine CCR5 downregulation in controllers without CCR5 mutations. These findings suggest that genetic and functional regulation of the primary HIV coreceptor CCR5 play a key role in promoting natural HIV control.","2022","2022 Jan 26","Mathieu Claireaux; Rémy Robinot; Jérôme Kervevan; Mandar Patgaonkar; Isabelle Staropoli; Anne Brelot; Alexandre Nouël; Stacy Gellenoncourt; Xian Tang; Mélanie Héry; Stevenn Volant; Emeline Perthame; Véronique Avettand-Fenoël; Julian Buchrieser; Thomas Cokelaer; Christiane Bouchier; Laurence Ma; Faroudy Boufassa; Samia Hendou; Valentina Libri; Milena Hasan; David Zucman; Pierre de Truchis; Olivier Schwartz; Olivier Lambotte; Lisa A Chakrabarti","Virus and Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; CNRS UMR3569, Paris, France.; Virus and Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; CNRS UMR3569, Paris, France.; Virus and Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; CNRS UMR3569, Paris, France.; Virus and Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; CNRS UMR3569, Paris, France.; Virus and Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; CNRS UMR3569, Paris, France.; Virus and Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; CNRS UMR3569, Paris, France.; Virus and Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; CNRS UMR3569, Paris, France.; Virus and Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; CNRS UMR3569, Paris, France.; Virus and Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; CNRS UMR3569, Paris, France.; Virus and Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; CNRS UMR3569, Paris, France.; Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Hub, Department of Computational Biology, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Hub, Department of Computational Biology, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; AP-HP Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades, Laboratoire de Microbiologie clinique, Paris, France.; CNRS 8104, INSERM U1016, Université Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Faculté de Médecine, Paris, France.; Virus and Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; CNRS UMR3569, Paris, France.; Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Hub, Department of Computational Biology, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; Biomics Platform, C2RT, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; Biomics Platform, C2RT, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; Biomics Platform, C2RT, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; INSERM U1018, Center for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health (CESP), Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France.; INSERM U1018, Center for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health (CESP), Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France.; Cytometry and Biomarkers (CB UTechS), Translational Research Center, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; Cytometry and Biomarkers (CB UTechS), Translational Research Center, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; HIV Unit, Foch Hospital, Suresnes, France.; AP-HP, Infectious and Tropical Diseases Department, Raymond Poincaré Hospital, Garches, France.; Virus and Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; CNRS UMR3569, Paris, France.; INSERM U1184, Université Paris Sud, CEA, Center for Immunology of Viral Infections and Autoimmune Diseases, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France.; AP-HP, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Paris Sud, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France.; Virus and Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Paris, France. chakra@pasteur.fr.; CNRS UMR3569, Paris, France. chakra@pasteur.fr."

HIV status was evaluated by ELISA, viral load and CD4/CD8 counts. They were treated with different cancer treatment modalities for cancers, HAART for HIV infection and followed up periodically. Of 172 cases of AIDS associated cancers, AIDS-Defining Cancers (ADCs) were seen in 84 (48.84%) and non-AIDS-Defining Cancers (NADC) in 88 patients (51.16%). Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma was the commonest AIDS-defining cancer in 58 (69.05%) patients. Extranodal presentations of ARLs was seen in 28 cases (19.86%) followed by cervical cancers in 26 (30.95%) women with HIV infection. Kaposi's sarcoma was not found. Head and neck cancers were the most common cancers in NADCs, followed by breast cancers and other types of cancers. Only two patients had HIV-2 associated cancers. One patient had immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS).Long-term non-progressor HIV infection with cancer was seen in one patient. 49 patients (28.49%) were receiving HAART. AIDS-associated cancers are seen in advanced stage of HIV infection. Concurrent chemotherapy and anti-retroviral therapy for ADCs show good control of both diseases.

To elucidate the biological mechanism of resistance to HIV replication at the molecular and cellular levels, we performed RNA sequencing and identified alternative splicing variants from ECs, HIV-infected individuals undergoing ART, ART-naive HIV-infected individuals, and healthy controls. We identified differential gene expression patterns that are specific to ECs and may influence HIV resistance, including alternative RNA splicing and exon usage variants of the CREM/ICER gene (cyclic AMP [cAMP]-responsive element modulator/inducible cAMP early repressors). The knockout and knockdown of specific ICER exons that were found to be upregulated in ECs resulted in significantly increased HIV infection in a CD4+ T cell line and primary CD4+ T cells. Overexpression of ICER isoforms decreased HIV infection in primary CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, ICER regulated HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter activity in a Tat-dependent manner. Together, these results suggest that ICER is an HIV host factor that may contribute to the HIV resistance of ECs. These findings will help elucidate the mechanisms of HIV control by ECs and may yield a new approach for treatment of HIV. IMPORTANCE A small group of HIV-infected individuals, termed elite controllers (ECs), display control of HIV replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the mechanism of ECs' resistance to HIV replication is not clear. In our work, we found an increased expression of specific, small isoforms of ICER in ECs. Further experiments proved that ICER is a robust host factor to regulate viral replication. Furthermore, we found that ICER regulates HIV LTR promoter activity in a Tat-dependent manner. These findings suggest that ICER is related to spontaneous control of HIV infection in ECs. This study may help elucidate a novel target for treatment of HIV.","2022","2022 Feb 22","Zhenwu Luo; Min Li; Tai-Wei Li; Zongyang Lv; Zhiwei Ye; William J Cisneros; Jie Zhang; Lingmin Yuan; Judd F Hultquist; Stephen A Migueles; Lei Huang; Jian Zhu; Wei Jiang","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolinagrid.259828.c, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolinagrid.259828.c, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.; Department of Pathology, Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolinagrid.259828.c, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.; Department of Biochemistry & Structural Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.; Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Medical University of South Carolinagrid.259828.c, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Medical University of South Carolinagrid.259828.c, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.; Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolinagrid.259828.c, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.; Department of Biochemistry & Structural Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolinagrid.259828.c, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.; Department of Pathology, Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolinagrid.259828.c, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolinagrid.259828.c, Charleston, South Carolina, USA."

In this study, we sought to identify signaling pathways associated with the EC phenotype using integrative proteo-transcriptomic analysis and immunophenotyping. We found HIF signaling and glycolysis as specific traits of the EC phenotype together with dysregulation of HIF target gene transcription. A higher proportion of HIF-1α and HIF-1β in the nuclei of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the male EC were observed, indicating a potential increased activation of the HIF signaling pathway. Furthermore, intracellular glucose levels were elevated in EC even as the surface expression of the metabolite transporters Glut1 and MCT-1 were decreased on lymphocytes indicative of unique metabolic uptake and flux profile. Combined, our data show that glycolytic modulation and altered HIF signaling is a unique feature of the male EC phenotype that may contribute to natural control of HIV-1.","2022","2022 Jan 21","Sara Svensson Akusjärvi; Anoop T Ambikan; Shuba Krishnan; Soham Gupta; Maike Sperk; Ákos Végvári; Flora Mikaeloff; Katie Healy; Jan Vesterbacka; Piotr Nowak; Anders Sönnerborg; Ujjwal Neogi","Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, ANA Futura, Campus Flemingsberg, 141 52 Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, ANA Futura, Campus Flemingsberg, 141 52 Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, ANA Futura, Campus Flemingsberg, 141 52 Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, ANA Futura, Campus Flemingsberg, 141 52 Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, ANA Futura, Campus Flemingsberg, 141 52 Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Chemistry I, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Campus Solna, 171 65 Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, ANA Futura, Campus Flemingsberg, 141 52 Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Oral Diagnostics and Rehabilitation, Department of Dental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, ANA Futura, Campus Flemingsberg, 141 52 Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine Huddinge, Division of Infectious Disease, Karolinska Institutet, I73, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine Huddinge, Division of Infectious Disease, Karolinska Institutet, I73, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, ANA Futura, Campus Flemingsberg, 141 52 Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine Huddinge, Division of Infectious Disease, Karolinska Institutet, I73, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, ANA Futura, Campus Flemingsberg, 141 52 Stockholm, Sweden.; Manipal Institute of Virology (MIV), Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka, India."

Here, we comprehensively tracked effects of antiviral immune responses on intact and defective proviral sequences from elite controllers (ECs), analyzing both classical escape mutations and HIV-1 chromosomal integration sites as biomarkers of antiviral immune selection pressure. We observed that, within ECs, defective proviruses were commonly located in permissive genic euchromatin positions, which represented an apparent contrast to autologous intact proviruses that were frequently located in heterochromatin regions; this suggests differential immune selection pressure on intact versus defective proviruses in ECs. In comparison to individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy, intact and defective proviruses from ECs showed reduced frequencies of escape mutations in cytotoxic T cell epitopes and antibody contact regions, possibly due to the small and poorly inducible reservoir that may be insufficient to drive effective viral escape in ECs. About 15% of ECs harbored nef deletions in intact proviruses, consistent with increased viral vulnerability to host immunity in the setting of nef dysfunction. Together, these results suggest a distinct signature of immune footprints in proviral sequences from ECs.","2021","2021 Dec 15","Xiaodong Lian; Ce Gao; Xiaoming Sun; Chenyang Jiang; Kevin B Einkauf; Kyra W Seiger; Joshua M Chevalier; Yuko Yuki; Maureen Martin; Rebecca Hoh; Michael J Peluso; Mary Carrington; Ezequiel Ruiz-Mateos; Steven G Deeks; Eric S Rosenberg; Bruce D Walker; Mathias Lichterfeld; Xu G Yu","Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Basic Science Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD and Laboratory of Integrative Cancer Immunology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.; Basic Science Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD and Laboratory of Integrative Cancer Immunology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.; University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.; University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Basic Science Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD and Laboratory of Integrative Cancer Immunology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.; Clinical Unit of Infectious Diseases, Microbiology and Preventive Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine of Seville (IBiS), Virgen del Rocío University Hospital, CSIC, University of Seville, Seville 41013, Spain.; University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD 20815, USA.; Institute for Medical Engineering and Sciences and Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."

In the livestock production field, identifying the ECs of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in cattle is desired to stop BLV transmission chains on farms. Cattle carrying the bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA)-DRB3*009:02 allele (DRB3*009:02) have a strong possibility of being BLV ECs. Most of cattle carrying this allele maintain undetectable BLV proviral loads and do not shed virus even when infected. BLV ECs can act as transmission barriers when placed between uninfected and infected cattle in a barn. To identify cattle carrying DRB3*009:02 in large populations more easily, we developed a pooled testing system. It employs a highly sensitive, specific real-time PCR assay and TaqMan MGB probes (DRB3*009:02-TaqMan assay). Using this system, we determined the percentage of DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle on Kyushu Island, Japan. Our pooled testing system detected cattle carrying the DRB3*009:02 allele from a DNA pool containing one DRB3*009:02-positive animal and 29 cattle with other alleles. Its capacity is sufficient for herd-level screening for DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle. The DRB3*009:02-TaqMan assay showed high-discriminative sensitivity and specificity toward DRB3*009:02, making it suitable for identifying DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle in post-screening tests on individuals. We determined that the percentage of DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle in Kyushu Island was 10.56%. With its ease of use and reliable detection, this new method strengthens the laboratory typing for DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle. Thus, our findings support the use of BLV ECs in the field.","2022","2022 Jan","Kosuke Notsu; Hala El Daous; Shuya Mitoma; Junzo Norimine; Satoshi Sekiguchi","Graduate School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.; Graduate School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.; Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Benha University, Toukh, Egypt.; Graduate School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.; Department of Veterinary Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.; Center for Animal Disease Control, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.; Department of Veterinary Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.; Center for Animal Disease Control, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan."

Understanding the burden, genetic diversity, and longevity of persisting proviruses in diverse individuals with HIV is critical to this goal, but these characteristics remain understudied in some groups. Among them are viremic controllers-individuals who naturally suppress HIV to low levels but for whom therapy is nevertheless recommended. We reconstructed within-host HIV evolutionary histories from longitudinal single-genome amplified viral sequences in four viremic controllers who eventually initiated ART and used this information to characterize the age and diversity of proviruses persisting on therapy. We further leveraged these within-host proviral age distributions to estimate rates of proviral turnover prior to ART. This is an important yet understudied metric, since pre-ART proviral turnover dictates reservoir composition at ART initiation (and thereafter), which is when curative interventions, once developed, would be administered. Despite natural viremic control, all participants displayed significant within-host HIV evolution pretherapy, where overall on-ART proviral burden and diversity broadly reflected the extent of viral replication and diversity pre-ART. Consistent with recent studies of noncontrollers, the proviral pools of two participants were skewed toward sequences that integrated near ART initiation, suggesting dynamic proviral turnover during untreated infection. In contrast, proviruses recovered from the other two participants dated to time points that were more evenly spread throughout infection, suggesting slow or negligible proviral decay following deposition. HIV cure strategies will need to overcome within-host proviral diversity, even in individuals who naturally controlled HIV replication before therapy. IMPORTANCE HIV therapy is lifelong because integrated, replication-competent viral copies persist within long-lived cells. To cure HIV, we need to understand when these viral reservoirs form, how large and genetically diverse they are, and how long they endure. Elite controllers-individuals who naturally suppress HIV to undetectable levels-are being intensely studied as models of HIV remission, but viremic controllers, individuals who naturally suppress HIV to low levels, remain understudied even though they too may hold valuable insights. We combined phylogenetics and mathematical modeling to reconstruct proviral seeding and decay from infection to therapy-mediated suppression in four viremic controllers. We recovered diverse proviruses persisting during therapy that broadly reflected HIV's within-host evolutionary history, where the estimated half-lives of the persistent proviral pool during untreated infection ranged from <1 year to negligible. Cure strategies will need to contend with proviral diversity and between-host heterogeneity, even in individuals who naturally control HIV.","2021","2021 Dec 21","F Harrison Omondi; Hanwei Sudderuddin; Aniqa Shahid; Natalie N Kinloch; Bradley R Jones; Rachel L Miller; Olivia Tsai; Daniel MacMillan; Alicja Trocha; Mark A Brockman; Chanson J Brumme; Jeffrey B Joy; Richard Liang; Bruce D Walker; Zabrina L Brumme","Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser Universitygrid.61971.38, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.; British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser Universitygrid.61971.38, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.; British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser Universitygrid.61971.38, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.; British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Bioinformatics Program, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Bioinformatics Program, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser Universitygrid.61971.38, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.; British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvardgrid.461656.6, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser Universitygrid.61971.38, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.; Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser Universitygrid.61971.38, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.; British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Bioinformatics Program, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvardgrid.461656.6, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser Universitygrid.61971.38, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.; British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."

HLA-B∗57 and HLA-B∗27 alleles are associated to efficient polyfunctional CD8+ T-cell response and are overrepresented in elite controllers but these alleles alone incompletely explain spontaneous HIV replication control in these subjects. Further mechanisms involved in innate and adaptive immune response and host genetics may contribute to this control. In this context, the homeostatic iron regulator (HFE) gene encodes a major histocompatibility complex-class-I-like molecule involved in both innate immunity, acting also through autophagy regulation, and iron homeostasis, strictly related to immune functions and susceptibility to infections. Homozygousity for the p.His63Asp (H63D) variant in the HFE gene was identified in an 80-year-old HIV-infected woman with spontaneous control of viral replication. HIV-1 RNA was undetectable in patient's serum with a routine assay and an ultra-sensitive assay (<1 copy/mL) during the 30 years follow-up. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts were stable and normal during all this period. The patient had a history of absence of any physical ailment and no antiviral therapy has been prescribed during the 30 years of follow-up. The subject did not harbor HLA-B∗57 and HLA-B∗27 alleles. HFE gene was sequenced by Sanger, as part of a larger study on a cohort of HIV infected patients, aged >65 years and screened for polymorphisms in genes belonging to several pathways involved in neuroinflammation. The woman had CD4+ and CD8+ T cell normal values and spontaneously controlled serum HIV-1 RNA levels for 30 years. We assume that the interplay between the HFE H63D variant in homozygosity and innate immunity, perhaps through autophagy regulation, could play a role in HIV-1 replication control in our patient. This hypothesis needs to be explored in in vitro and in vivo studies. Understanding mechanisms involved in spontaneous control of HIV-1 replication remains indeed a challenge due to its possible implications for HIV cure research.","2021","2021 Nov 12","Isabella Zanella; Emanuele Focà; Melania Degli-Antoni; Francesco Castelli; Eugenia Quiros-Roldan","Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory, Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics Section, Diagnostic Department, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.; University Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.; University Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.; University Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.; University Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy."

Previously, we identified a group of ART-naive children with persistently undetectable plasma viremia, termed ""elite controllers,"" and a second group who achieved aviremia only transiently. To investigate the mechanisms of failure to maintain aviremia, we characterized in three transient aviremic individuals (TAs), each of whom expressed the disease-protective HLA-B*81:01, longitudinal HIV-specific T-cell activity, and viral sequences. In two TAs, a CD8+ T-cell response targeting the immunodominant epitope TPQDLNTML (Gag-TL9) was associated with viral control, followed by viral rebound and the emergence of escape variants with lower replicative capacity. Both TAs mounted variant-specific responses, but only at low functional avidity, resulting in immunological progression. In contrast, in TA-3, intermittent viremic episodes followed aviremia without virus escape or a diminished CD4+ T-cell count. High quality and magnitude of the CD8+ T-cell response were associated with aviremia. We therefore identify two distinct mechanisms of loss of viral control. In one scenario, CD8+ T-cell responses initially cornered low-replicative-capacity escape variants, but with insufficient avidity to prevent viremia and disease progression. In the other, loss of viral control was associated with neither virus escape nor progression but with a decrease in the quality of the CD8+ T-cell response, followed by recovery of viral control in association with improved antiviral response. These data suggest the potential for a consistently strong and polyfunctional antiviral response to achieve long-term viral control without escape. IMPORTANCE Very early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pediatric HIV infection offers a unique opportunity to limit the size and diversity of the viral reservoir. However, only rarely is ART alone sufficient to achieve remission. Additional interventions that likely include contributions from host immunity are therefore required. The HIV-specific T-cell response plays a central role in immune control of adult HIV, often mediated through protective alleles such as HLA-B*57/58:01/81:01. However, due to the tolerogenic and type 2 biased immune response in early life, HLA-I-mediated immune suppression of viremia is seldom observed in children. We assessed a rare group of HLA-B*81:01-positive, ART-naive children who achieved aviremia, albeit only transiently, and investigated the role of the CD8+ T-cell response in the establishment and loss of viral control. We identified a mechanism by which the HIV-specific response can achieve viremic control without viral escape that can be explored in strategies to achieve remission.","2022","2022 Jan 26","Vinicius A Vieira; Emily Adland; Nicholas E Grayson; Anna Csala; Fa'eeda Richards; Cherrelle Dacon; Rohin Athavale; Ming-Han Tsai; Reena D'Souza; Maximilian Muenchhoff; David Bonsall; Pieter Jooste; Philip J R Goulder","Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxfordgrid.4991.5, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxfordgrid.4991.5, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxfordgrid.4991.5, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxfordgrid.4991.5, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Department of Paediatrics, Kimberley Hospital, Kimberley, South Africa.; Antibody Biology Unit, Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, USA.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxfordgrid.4991.5, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxfordgrid.4991.5, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxfordgrid.4991.5, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Max von Pettenkofer Institute & Gene Center, Virology, National Reference Center for Retroviruses, LMU München, Munich, Germany.; German Center for Infection Research, Munich, Germany.; Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxfordgrid.4991.5, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxfordgrid.4991.5, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Department of Paediatrics, Kimberley Hospital, Kimberley, South Africa.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxfordgrid.4991.5, Oxford, United Kingdom.; HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa."

CD4+ CTLs have also been shown to kill HIV-infected macrophages. However, little is known about their contribution towards HIV persistence, how they are affected following exposure to immune modulators like morphine, and what factors maintain their frequencies and function. Further, the lack of robust markers to identify CD4+ CTLs in various animal models limits understanding of their role in HIV pathogenesis. We utilized various PBMC samples obtained from SIV infected and cART treated rhesus macaques exposed to morphine or saline and subjected to flow cytometry evaluations. Thereafter, we compared and correlated the expression of CD4+ CTL-specific markers to viral load and viral reservoir estimations in total CD4+ T cells. We found that CD29 could be reliably used as a marker to identify CD4+ CTLs in rhesus macaques since CD29hi CD4+ T cells secrete higher cytotoxic and proinflammatory cytokines following PMA/ionomycin or gag stimulation. In addition, this immune cell subset was depleted during untreated SIV infection. Strikingly, we also observed that early initiation of cART reconstitutes depleted CD29hi CD4+ T cells and restores their function. Furthermore, we noted that morphine exposure reduced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines/cytotoxic molecules in CD29hi CD4+ T cells. Lastly, increased functionality of CD29hi CD4+ T cells as depicted by elevated levels of either IL-21 or granzyme B hi T Bet+ gag specific responses were linked to limiting the size of the replication-competent reservoir during cART treatment.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IL21 production during HIV-1 infection, which is only elevated among the naturally protected elite controllers (EC), are still unknown. We recently found out that lipophagy is a critical immune mediator that control an antiviral metabolic state following CD8A T cell receptor engagement, playing an important role in the natural control of HIV-1 infection. This led us to investigate whether the beneficial role of a strong macroautophagy/autophagy, could also be used to ensure effective IL21 production as well. Herein, we confirm that after both polyclonal and HIV-1-specific activation, memory CD4 T cells (Mem) from EC display enhanced activity of the autophagy-mediated proteolysis compared to ART. Our results indicate that the enhanced autophagy activity in EC was controlled by the energy-sensing PRKAA1 (protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1). We further confirmed the critical role of the autophagy-mediated proteolysis in the strong IL21 production in EC by using BECN1 gene silencing as well as protease, PRKAA1, and lysosomal inhibitors. Finally, we established that high autophagy-mediated proteolysis in EC fuels their cellular rates of mitochondrial respiration due to glutaminolysis. Our data confirm the critical role of autophagy in dictating the metabolic input, which is required not only to ensure protective cytotoxic CD8A T cell responses, but also to provide strong IL21 production among antiviral CD4 T cells.Abbreviations: AKG: alpha-ketoglutarate; ART: patients under antiretroviral therapy; ATG7: autophagy related 7; BaF: bafilomycin A1; BECN1: beclin 1; Chloro.: chloroquine; EC: elite controllers; EIF4EBP1: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1; FOXO3: forkhead box O3; GLS: glutaminase; GLUD1: glutamate dehydrogenase 1; HIVneg: HIV-1-uninfected control donors; IFNG/IFN-γ: interferon gamma; IL21: interleukin 21; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PRKAA1: protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase.","2022","2022 Jun","Hamza Loucif; Xavier Dagenais-Lussier; Daina Avizonis; Luc Choinière; Cherifa Beji; Léna Cassin; Jean-Pierre Routy; Jörg H Fritz; David Olagnier; Julien van Grevenynghe","Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS)-Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie, Laval, Quebec, Canada.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS)-Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie, Laval, Quebec, Canada.; Metabolomics Innovation Resource, Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Center, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Metabolomics Innovation Resource, Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Center, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS)-Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie, Laval, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Biomedicine, Research Center for Innate Immunology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Chronic Viral Illness Service and Division of Hematology, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Biomedicine, Research Center for Innate Immunology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS)-Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie, Laval, Quebec, Canada."

Although viremic nonprogressors are more common in vertical HIV-infection than in adults' infection, elite control has been rarely characterized in the pediatric population. We analyzed the T-cell immunophenotype and the HIV-specific response by flow cytometry in four pediatric elite controllers (PECs) compared with age-matched nonprogressors (PNPs), progressors and HIV-exposed uninfected (HEUs) adolescents. PECs T-cell populations had lower immune activation and exhaustion levels when compared with progressors, reflected by a more sustained and preserved effector function. The HIV-specific T-cell responses among PECs were characterized by high-frequency Gag-specific CD4+ T-cell activity, and markedly more polyfunctional Gag-specific CD8+ activity, compared with PNPs and progressors. These findings were consistently observed even in the absence of protective HLA-I molecules such as HLA-B∗27/57/81. Pediatric elite control is normally achieved after years of infection, and low immune activation in PNPs precedes the increasing ability of CD8+ T-cell responses to achieve immune control of viraemia over the course of childhood, whereas in adults, high immune activation in acute infection predicts subsequent CD8+ T-cell mediated immune control of viremia, and in adult elite controllers, low immune activation is therefore the consequence of the rapid CD8+ T-cell mediated immune control generated after acute infection. This distinct strategy adopted by PECs may help identify pathways that facilitate remission in posttreatment controllers, in whom protective HLA-I molecules are not the main factor.","2022","2022 Jan 01","Vinicius A Vieira; Jane Millar; Emily Adland; Maximilian Muenchhoff; Julia Roider; Claudia Fortuny Guash; Denise Peluso; Beatriz Thomé; Maria C Garcia-Guerrero; Mari C Puertas; Alasdair Bamford; Christian Brander; Mary Carrington; Javier Martinez-Picado; John Frater; Gareth Tudor-Williams; Philip Goulder","Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), Durban, South Africa.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Max von Pettenkofer-Institute, Department of Virology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University.; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF).; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF).; Department of Infectious Diseases, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.; Unidad de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Servicio de Pediatría, Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas.; Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Departamento de Medicina Preventiva, São Paulo, Brazil.; IrsiCaixa - AIDS Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.; IrsiCaixa - AIDS Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.; Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust.; UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.; IrsiCaixa - AIDS Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.; Universitat de Vic-Universitat Central de Catalunya, Vic.; Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats, Barcelona, Spain.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Basic Science Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research in the Laboratory of Integrative Cancer Immunology, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; IrsiCaixa - AIDS Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.; Universitat de Vic-Universitat Central de Catalunya, Vic.; Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats, Barcelona, Spain.; Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford.; Oxford NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College, London, UK.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), Durban, South Africa."

We report the proportion of HIV-1 controllers in a group of adults prospectively monitored with frequent viral load measurements as part of a clinical trial in West Africa. For the Temprano trial, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive HIV-1 infected adults with no criteria for starting ART were randomized to start ART immediately or defer ART until the WHO starting criteria were met. Plasma viral load was measured every 6 months. The trial follow-up was 30 months. We considered all Temprano participants randomized to defer ART. Patients with all semestrial viral <2000 copies/ml and still off ART at month 30 were defined as HIV-1 controllers. Controllers with all viral loads <50 copies/ml were defined as elite controllers, the rest as viremic controllers. Of the 1023 HIV-1-infected adults randomized in the Temprano deferred-ART group, 18 (1.8%) met the criteria for classification as HIV controllers, of whom seven (0.7%) were elite controllers and 11 (1.1%) viremic controllers. The HIV-1 controllers had low peripheral blood mononuclear cell HIV-1 DNA and low inflammatory marker levels. They maintained high CD4+ cell count and percentages and had a low morbidity rate. HIV controllers exist in Africa at a proportion close to that reported elsewhere. They represent a small fraction of all HIV-1-infected patients but raise important questions. Further studies should assess whether starting ART might represent more risk than benefit for some controllers, and where it does, how to identify these patients before they start ART.","2022","2022 Jan 01","Jean Baptiste N'takpé; Delphine Gabillard; Raoul Moh; Elise Gardiennet; Thomas-d'Aquin Toni; Gérard M Kouame; Anani Badje; Arlette Emieme; Sophie Karcher; Jérome Le Carrou; Hervé Ménan; Christine Danel; Serge P Eholie; Christine Rouzioux; Xavier Anglaret; Olivier Lambotte","Inserm 1219, University of Bordeaux, IRD, Bordeaux, France.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; Département de Dermatologie et Maladies Infectieuses, Université Felix Houphouët Boigny, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.; Inserm 1219, University of Bordeaux, IRD, Bordeaux, France.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; Inserm 1219, University of Bordeaux, IRD, Bordeaux, France.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; Département de Dermatologie et Maladies Infectieuses, Université Felix Houphouët Boigny, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.; AP-HP, CHU Necker Enfants Malades, Université Paris Descartes, Paris, France.; Inserm 1219, University of Bordeaux, IRD, Bordeaux, France.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; CeDReS, CHU de Treichville, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.; Inserm 1219, University of Bordeaux, IRD, Bordeaux, France.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; Département de Dermatologie et Maladies Infectieuses, Université Felix Houphouët Boigny, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.; Inserm 1219, University of Bordeaux, IRD, Bordeaux, France.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; Département de Dermatologie et Maladies Infectieuses, Université Felix Houphouët Boigny, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.; Inserm 1219, University of Bordeaux, IRD, Bordeaux, France.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; CeDReS, CHU de Treichville, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.; Inserm 1219, University of Bordeaux, IRD, Bordeaux, France.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; Inserm 1219, University of Bordeaux, IRD, Bordeaux, France.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; Inserm 1219, University of Bordeaux, IRD, Bordeaux, France.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; CeDReS, CHU de Treichville, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.; Inserm 1219, University of Bordeaux, IRD, Bordeaux, France.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; Inserm 1219, University of Bordeaux, IRD, Bordeaux, France.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; Département de Dermatologie et Maladies Infectieuses, Université Felix Houphouët Boigny, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; Faculté de Médecine, Université Paris Descartes, Paris.; Inserm 1219, University of Bordeaux, IRD, Bordeaux, France.; PACCI/ANRS Research Center.; AP-HP Paris Saclay, Hôpital Bicêtre, Clinical Immunology Department.; Université Paris-Saclay, Inserm, CEA, Center for Immunology of Viral, Auto-immune, Hematological and Bacterial diseases (IDMIT/IMVA-HB), Le Kremlin Bicêtre, France."

We used an antibody profiling system, VirScan, to compare antibody reactivity and specificity in HIV controllers, non-controllers with treatment-induced viral suppression, and viremic non-controllers. The VirScan library contains 3,384 phage-displayed peptides spanning the HIV proteome. Antibody reactivity to these peptides was measured in plasma from a Discovery Cohort that included 13 elite controllers, 27 viremic controllers, 12 viremic non-controllers, and 21 non-controllers who were virally suppressed on ART. Antibody reactivity to selected peptides was also assessed in an independent cohort of 29 elite controllers and 37 non-controllers who were virally suppressed on ART (Validation Cohort) and in a longitudinal cohort of non-controllers. In the Discovery Cohort, 62 peptides were preferentially targeted in HIV controllers compared to non-controllers who were virally suppressed on ART. These specificities were not significantly different when comparing controllers versus viremic non-controllers. Aggregate reactivity to these peptides was also high in elite controllers from the independent Validation Cohort. The 62 peptides formed seven clusters of homologous epitopes in env, gag, integrase, and vpu. Reactivity to one of these clusters located in gag p17 was inversely correlated with viral load set point in an independent cohort of non-controllers. Antibody reactivity was low in non-controllers suppressed on ART, but remained high in viremic controllers despite viral suppression. Antibodies in controllers and viremic non-controllers were directed against epitopes in diverse HIV proteins; higher reactivity against p17 peptides was associated with lower viral load set point.

Early antiretroviral treatment (ART) upon HIV infection improves CD4 count and decreases immune activation. However, Treg dynamics and their epigenetic regulation following early ART initiation remain understudied. Treg subsets were characterized by flow cytometry in 103 individuals, including untreated HIV-infected participants in acute and chronic phases, ART-treated in early infection, elite controllers (ECs), immunological controllers (ICs), and HIV-uninfected controls. The methylation status of six regulatory regions of the foxp3 gene was assessed using MiSeq technology. Total Treg frequency increased overtime during HIV infection, which was normalized in early ART recipients. Tregs in untreated individuals expressed higher levels of activation and immunosuppressive markers (CD39, and LAP(TGF-β1)), which remained unchanged following early ART. Expression of gut migration markers (CCR9, Integrin-β7) by Tregs was elevated during untreated HIV infection, while they declined with the duration of ART but not upon early ART initiation. Notably, gut-homing Tregs expressing LAP(TGF-β1) and CD39 remained higher despite early treatment. Additionally, the increase in LAP(TGF-β1)+ Tregs overtime were consistent with higher demethylation of conserved non-coding sequence (CNS)-1 in the foxp3 gene. Remarkably, LAP(TGF-β1)-expressing Tregs in ECs were significantly higher than in uninfected subjects, while the markers of Treg activation and gut migration were not different. Early ART initiation was unable to control the levels of immunosuppressive Treg subsets and their gut migration potential, which could ultimately contribute to gut tissue fibrosis and HIV disease progression.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the expression pattern of miR-27b, -29, -150, and -221, as well as their relationship with CD4+ T-cell count, HIV-1 viral load, and nef gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of untreated viremic patients and in LTNPs. MiRNAs expression levels were evaluated with real-time PCR assay using RNA isolated from PBMCs of LTNPs, HIV-1 infected naive patients, and healthy people. Moreover, CD4 T-cell count, HIV viral load, and nef gene expression were assessed. The expression level of all miRNAs significantly decreased in the HIV-1 patient group compared to the control group, while the expression pattern of miRNAs in the LNTPs group was similar to that in the healthy subject group. In addition, there were significant correlations between some miRNA expression with viral load, CD4+ T-cell count, and nef gene expression. The significant similarity and difference of the miRNA expression pattern between LNTPs and healthy individuals as well as between elite controllers and HIV-infected patients, respectively, showed that these miRNAs could be used as diagnostic biomarkers.

As per HIV treatment guidelines in Uganda, the first VL test is recommended 6 months after initiation of ART. Undetectable VL (uVL) at ART initiation may be helpful in detecting elite controllers in the absence of previous ART use. We investigated viral suppression at ART initiation among a cohort of HIV-positive pregnant women enrolled in the Friends for Life Circles (FLC) for Option B+ randomized controlled trial (RCT). Pregnant women ≥ 18 years of age testing positive for HIV at their first antenatal care visit and starting on ART Option B+ as per the National PMTCT Program guidelines were enrolled into the FLC for Option B+ RCT in urban Kampala and rural Mityana districts of Uganda. Each participant had whole blood samples collected at enrolment to assess baseline VL. Plasma HIV-1 RNA was quantified using COBAS Ampliprep /COBAS Taqman. Baseline VL below 400 RNA copies/ml was considered as viral suppression while baseline VL below 20 RNA copies/ml was considered uVL. The mean duration from the date of ART initiation to time of sample collection for baseline VL assessment was 4.4 days (SD 3.6). Of the 532 HIV-positive pregnant women enrolled in the FLC for Option B+ study and newly starting Option B+ without a self-reported history of prior ART use, 29 (5.5%) had uVL and 113 (21.4%) had suppressed VL at baseline. There was no association between participants' age, gravidity, marital status, mean monthly income, educational level, disclosure of HIV status to partner, and uVL or viral suppression at baseline. However, non-disclosure of HIV status to any other person was associated with decreased odds of viral suppression at baseline (OR 0.640; 0.416-0.982). Twenty-one percent of HIV-positive Ugandan pregnant women initiating ART (Option B+) showed virological suppression at baseline and were presumed to be ""elite controllers"" or to have misreported being ART-naive.

These challenges suggest that a combinatorial approach that harnesses both bNAbs and CD8 T cell responses may be necessary for long term control of viral replication.

Our data suggest that this combinatorial approach is very effective at suppressing viral replication in vitro and should be considered in future therapeutic studies.","2021","2021","Rebecca T Veenhuis; Caroline C Garliss; Justin R Bailey; Joel N Blankson","Department of Molecular and Comparative Pathobiology, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Department of Molecular and Comparative Pathobiology, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States."

DPP4/CD26 has been suggested to be a potential therapeutic target and a biomarker for risk in COVID-19 patients with high risk co-morbidities. We therefore evaluated soluble DPP4 (sDPP4) levels and activity in plasma of 131 HIV-infected and 20 HIV-uninfected South African individuals. Flow cytometry was performed to compare cell surface expression of DPP4/CD26 and activation markers on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of extreme clinical phenotypes. Progressors had lower specific DPP4 activity and lower frequency of CD3+ T-cells expressing CD26 than HIV-1 controllers, but more activated CD3+CD26+ T-cells. The frequency of CD26-expressing T-cells negatively correlated with HLA-DR+ and CD38+ T-cells. Divergent DPP4/CD26 expression between HIV-1 controllers and progressors may have implications for risk and treatment of COVID-19 in people living with HIV.","2021","2021 Sep","Yashini Govender; Sharon Shalekoff; Osman Ebrahim; Ziyaad Waja; Richard E Chaisson; Neil Martinson; Caroline T Tiemessen","Centre for HIV & STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, National Health Laboratory Service and Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.; Centre for HIV & STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, National Health Laboratory Service and Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.; Department of Therapeutic Sciences, Division of Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.; Perinatal HIV Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; Medical Research Council Soweto Matlosana Centre for HIV/AIDS and TB Research, South Africa.; Johns Hopkins University Centre for AIDS Research, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Perinatal HIV Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; Medical Research Council Soweto Matlosana Centre for HIV/AIDS and TB Research, South Africa.; Centre for HIV & STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, National Health Laboratory Service and Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.

Here, we compared the contributions of naive and memory cells to the reservoirs of individuals with a spectrum of reservoir sizes and variable immunological control. We performed proviral sequencing of approximately 6000 proviruses from cellular subsets of 5 elite controllers (ECs) off antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 5 chronic progressors (CPs) on ART. The levels of naive infection were barely detectable in ECs and approximately 300-fold lower compared with those in CPs. Moreover, the ratio of infected naive to memory cells was significantly lower in ECs. Overall, the naive infection level increased as reservoir size increased, such that naive cells were a major contributor to the intact reservoir of CPs, whose reservoirs were generally very diverse. In contrast, the reservoirs of ECs were dominated by proviral clones. Critically, the fraction of proviral clones increased with cell differentiation, with naive infection predicting reservoir diversity. Longitudinal sequencing revealed that the reservoir of ECs was less dynamic compared with that of CPs. Naive cells play a critical role in HIV persistence. Their infection level predicts reservoir size and diversity. Moreover, the diminishing diversity of the reservoir as cellular subsets mature suggests that naive T cells repopulate the memory compartment and that direct infection of naive T cells occurs in vivo.","2021","2021 Aug 23","Marilia R Pinzone; Sam Weissman; Alexander O Pasternak; Ryan Zurakowski; Stephen Migueles; Una O'Doherty","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Medical Microbiology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Laboratory of Experimental Virology, Amsterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA.; HIV-Specific Immunity Section of the Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."

Whether these HIV controllers (HIC) are at risk of HIV-associated comorbidities and could benefit from ART is debated, but recent studies reported decreased T-cell activation upon ART initiation. We report the frequency of ART initiation, reasons to treat, treatment outcome on immunovirological parameters, and rate of side-effects and treatment discontinuation in the French cohort of HIC. Participants included in the French multicenter Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le SIDA et les Hépatites (ANRS) Cohorte des extremes (CODEX) cohort of HIC between July 6, 2007 and January 3, 2018 were prospectively followed. ART initiation, indication, discontinuation, non-Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)-defining events, side-effects, and immunovirological parameters were recorded. Undetectable HIC (u-HIC) were defined as participants with strictly undetectable viral loads based on routinely used assays throughout the follow-up and blipper HIC (b-HIC) as participants with possible detectable viral loads above the detection threshold during follow-up. Among 302 HIC followed for a median of 14.8 years [10.3-20.2], 90 (30%) received ART (7 u-HIC and 83 b-HIC). The main reasons for ART initiation were decreased CD4 T-cell counts (n = 36, 40%), loss of virological control (n = 13, 14%), and non-AIDS-defining events (n = 12, 13%). Sixteen (18%) participants experienced 17 grade 1-2 adverse events. In b-HIC, ART slightly increased the CD4/CD8 ratio (median +0.19, p < 0.0001) and decreased the frequency of circulating CD38+ HLA-DR.+ CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes (median -0.75%, p = 0.003, and -2%, p < 0.0001, respectively), but these changes were not observed for treated u-HIC. Thirteen (14%) participants discontinued ART (5 (38%) because of side-effects, and 10 remained HIC after treatment cessation (median follow-up: 305 days [235-728]). Only 30% of participants in this large cohort of HIC required ART during a median follow-up of 14.8 years. These results show that HIC status is very stable and vouch for a patient-centered treatment decision based on the individual benefit/risk balance.","2021","2021 Jul","Léo Plaçais; Faroudy Boufassa; Camille Lécuroux; Elise Gardiennet; Véronique Avettand-Fenoel; Asier Saez-Cirion; Olivier Lambotte; Nicolas Noël; ","AP-HP, GHU Paris-Saclay, Hôpital Bicêtre, Service de Médecine Interne et Immunologie Clinique, Le Kremlin Bicêtre, 78, rue du Général Leclerc, 94275 CEDEX, France.; Inserm, CEA, Centre de Recherche en Immunologie des Infections Virales et des Maladies Auto-Immunes ImVA, Université Paris-Saclay, UMR1184, Le Kremlin Bicêtre 94270, France.; CESP, Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health, Univ Paris-Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, UVSQ, Inserm UMRS 1018, Villejuif, France.; Inserm, CEA, Centre de Recherche en Immunologie des Infections Virales et des Maladies Auto-Immunes ImVA, Université Paris-Saclay, UMR1184, Le Kremlin Bicêtre 94270, France.; AP-HP, Laboratoire de Microbiologie Clinique, Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.; Faculté de Médecine, INSERM U1016, CNRS, UMR8104, Institut Cochin, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; AP-HP, Laboratoire de Microbiologie Clinique, Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.; Faculté de Médecine, INSERM U1016, CNRS, UMR8104, Institut Cochin, Université de Paris, Paris, France.; Institut Pasteur, Unité HIV, Inflammation et Persistance, Paris, France.; AP-HP, GHU Paris-Saclay, Hôpital Bicêtre, Service de Médecine Interne et Immunologie Clinique, Le Kremlin Bicêtre, 78, rue du Général Leclerc, 94275 CEDEX, France.; Inserm, CEA, Centre de Recherche en Immunologie des Infections Virales et des Maladies Auto-Immunes ImVA, Université Paris-Saclay, UMR1184, Le Kremlin Bicêtre 94270, France.; Faculté de Médecine, Université Paris Saclay, Le Kremlin Bicêtre, France.; AP-HP, GHU Paris-Saclay, Hôpital Bicêtre, Service de Médecine Interne et Immunologie Clinique, Le Kremlin Bicêtre, 78, rue du Général Leclerc, 94275 CEDEX, France.; Inserm, CEA, Centre de Recherche en Immunologie des Infections Virales et des Maladies Auto-Immunes ImVA, Université Paris-Saclay, UMR1184, Le Kremlin Bicêtre 94270, France.; Faculté de Médecine, Université Paris Saclay, Le Kremlin Bicêtre, France."

Individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection have lower numbers of circulating MAIT cells compared with healthy individuals, yet the features of the MAIT TCR repertoire are not well known. We isolated and stimulated human PBMCs from healthy non-HIV-infected donors (HD), HIV-infected progressors on antiretroviral therapy, and HIV-infected elite controllers (EC). We sorted MAIT cells using flow cytometry and used a high-throughput sequencing method with bar coding to link the expression of TCRα, TCRβ, and functional genes of interest at the single-cell level. We show differential patterns of MAIT TCR usage among the groups. We observed expansions of certain dominant MAIT clones in HIV-infected individuals upon Escherichia coli stimulation, which was not observed in clones of HD. We also found different patterns of CDR3 amino acid distributions among the three groups. Furthermore, we found blunted expression of phenotypic genes in HIV individuals; most notably, HD mounted a robust IFNG response to stimulation, whereas both HIV-infected progressors and EC did not. In conclusion, our study describes the diverse MAIT TCR repertoire of persons with chronic HIV-1 infection and suggest that MAIT clones of HIV-infected persons may be primed for expansion more than that of noninfected persons. Further studies are needed to examine the functional significance of unique MAIT cell TCR usage in EC.","2021","2021 May 27","Shubhanshi Trivedi; Taliman Afroz; Michael S Bennett; Kendal Angell; Fabio Barros; Racheal A Nell; Jian Ying; Adam M Spivak; Daniel T Leung","Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; and Shubhanshi.Trivedi@hsc.utah.edu daniel.leung@utah.edu.; Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; and.; Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; and.; Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; and.; Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; and.; Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; and.; Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; and.; Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; and.; Division of Microbiology and Immunology, Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.; Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; and Shubhanshi.Trivedi@hsc.utah.edu daniel.leung@utah.edu.; Division of Microbiology and Immunology, Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT."

Hence, discovery of HIV-regulated host proteins markers would better our understanding of the virus life-cycle and its contribution to pathogenesis and discovery of objective diagnostic and prognostic molecules. We conducted holistic total proteomics analysis of three closely related study populations including patients with HIV type-1 (HIV-1) and HIV type-2 (HIV-2) as well as HIV-1 elite controllers (HIV-1-EC). Peripheral blood plasma (PBP) samples were subjected to label-free quantitative liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Over 314 unique PBP protein species were identified of which 100 (approx. 32%) were significantly differentially expressed (≥2 to ∞ - fold-change; p < 0.05) between the three sample cohorts. Of the 100 proteins, 91 were significantly changed between pairs of HIV-1 versus HIV-1-EC, while 83 of the 100 proteins differed significantly between HIV-2 and HIV-1-EC. Interestingly, 76 proteins (87.5%) overlap between the two data sets indicating that majority of these proteins share similar expression changes between HIV-1 and HIV-2 sample groups. Two of the identified proteins, XRCC5 and PSME1, were implicated in the early phase of the pathway network for HIV life cycle, while others were involved in infectious disease and disease of signal transduction. Among them were MAP2K1, RPL23A, RPS3, CALR, PRDX1, SOD2, LMNB1, PHB, and FGB. Despite the high degree of similarity in protein profiles of HIV-1 and HIV-2, six proteins differed significantly including ETFB, PHB2, S100A9, LMO2, PPP3R1 and Vif, a fragment of virion infectivity factor of HIV-1. Additionally, 15 proteins were uniquely expressed, and one of them (LSP1) is present only in HIV-1-EC but absent in HIV1 and HIV-2 and vice versa for the rest 14 proteins.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying HIV control in elite controllers (ECs), which maintain undetectable viral load in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, may facilitate the development of new effective therapeutic strategies. We developed an original pipeline for an analysis of the transcriptional profiles of CD8+ cells from ECs, treated and untreated progressors. Hierarchical cluster analysis of CD8+ cells' transcription profiles allowed us to identify five distinct groups (EC groups 1-5) of ECs. The transcriptional profiles of EC group 1 were opposite to those of groups 2-4 and similar to those of the treated progressors, which can be associated with residual activation and dysfunction of CD8+ T-lymphocytes. The profiles of groups 2-4 were associated with different numbers of differentially expressed genes compared to healthy controls, but the corresponding genes shared the same cellular processes. These three groups were associated with increased metabolism, survival, proliferation, and the absence of an ""exhausted"" phenotype, compared to both untreated progressors and healthy controls. The CD8+ lymphocytes from these groups of ECs may contribute to the control under HIV replication and slower disease progression. The EC group 5 was indistinguishable from normal. Application of master regulator analysis allowed us to identify 22 receptors, including interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, and androgen receptors, which may be responsible for the observed expression changes and the functional states of CD8+ cells from ECs. These receptors can be considered potential targets of therapeutic intervention, which may decelerate disease progression.","2021","2021","Sergey Ivanov; Dmitry Filimonov; Olga Tarasova","Department of Bioinformatics, Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Moscow, Russia.; Department of Bioinformatics, Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Moscow, Russia.; Department of Bioinformatics, Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Moscow, Russia.; Department of Bioinformatics, Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Moscow, Russia."

This is a cross-sectional analysis of archived CSF and blood samples, assessing concentrations of 10 functionally diverse soluble inflammatory biomarkers by immunoassays in 143 HIV-1-infected subjects divided into 8 groups: untreated primary HIV-1 infection (PHI); four untreated groups defined by their blood CD4+ T lymphocyte counts; untreated patients presenting with subacute HIV-associated dementia (HAD); antiretroviral-treated subjects with ≥1 years of plasma viral suppression; and untreated elite controllers. Twenty HIV-1-uninfected controls were included for comparison. Background biomarkers included blood CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, CSF and blood HIV-1 RNA, CSF white blood cell (WBC) count, CSF/blood albumin ratio, CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL), and CSF t-tau. HIV-1 infection was associated with a broad compartmentalized CSF inflammatory response that developed early in its course and changed with systemic disease progression, development of neurological injury, and viral suppression. CSF inflammation in untreated individuals without overt HAD exhibited at least two overall patterns of inflammation as blood CD4+ T lymphocytes decreased: one that peaked at 200-350 blood CD4+ T cells/μL and associated with lymphocytic CSF inflammation and HIV-1 RNA concentrations; and a second that steadily increased through the full range of CD4+ T cell decline and associated with macrophage responses and increasing CNS injury. Subacute HAD was distinguished by a third inflammatory profile with increased blood-brain barrier permeability and robust combined lymphocytic and macrophage CSF inflammation.

Here, we demonstrate an upregulation of the host long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MIR4435-2HG in primary myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) from ECs. Elevated expression of this lncRNA in mDCs was associated with a distinct immunometabolic profile, characterized by increased oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis activities in response to TLR3 stimulation. Using functional assays, we show that MIR4435-2HG directly influenced the metabolic state of mDCs, likely through epigenetic mechanisms involving H3K27ac enrichment at an intronic enhancer in the RPTOR gene locus, the main component of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Together, these results suggest a role of MIR4435-2HG for enhancing immunometabolic activities of mDCs in ECs through targeted epigenetic modifications of a member of the mTOR signaling pathway.","2021","2021 May 03","Ciputra Adijaya Hartana; Yelizaveta Rassadkina; Ce Gao; Enrique Martin-Gayo; Bruce D Walker; Mathias Lichterfeld; Xu G Yu","Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Immunology Unit, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Hospital Universitario la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Institute for Medical Engineering and Sciences, and.; Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."

Furthermore, such studies have been limited by the paucity of well-characterised samples and linked epidemiological data, including duration of infection and clinical outcomes. To address this, we selected 10 volunteers who rapidly and persistently controlled HIV, and 10 volunteers each, from two control groups who failed to control (based on set point viral loads) from an acute and early HIV prospective cohort from East and Southern Africa. A propensity score matching approach was applied to control for the influence of five factors (age, risk group, virus subtype, gender, and country) known to influence disease progression on causal observations. Fifty-two plasma proteins were assessed at two timepoints in the 1st year of infection. We independently confirmed factors known to influence disease progression such as the B*57 HLA Class I allele, and infecting virus Subtype. We demonstrated associations between circulating levels of MIP-1α and IL-17C, and the ability to control infection.

Here, we analyzed HIV controllers and ART suppressed progressors for in vitro viral suppressive capacity (VSC) at baseline and after peptide stimulation. Functional properties and phenotypes of CD8+ T cells were assessed by IFN-γ ELISPOT and 18 color flow cytometry. HIV controllers showed significantly increased suppression at baseline as well as after peptide stimulation. IFN-γ secretion and the proliferation marker Ki67 positively correlated with VSC. Moreover, the detailed phenotype of three distinct multifunctional memory CD8+ T cell subsets were specific traits of HIV controllers of which two correlated convincingly with VSC.

In recent surveillance studies (2017-18), we found that the prevalence of HIV in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (11%) far exceeded previous estimates. 10,457 participants were screened in Kinshasa with rapid tests from 2017-2019. Individuals confirmed as reactive by the Abbott ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo assay (n=1968) were measured by the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 viral load assay. Follow up characterization of samples was performed with alternate manufacturer viral load assays, qPCR for additional blood borne viruses, unbiased next generation sequencing, and HIV Western blotting. Our data suggested the existence of a significant cohort (n=429) of HIV antibody positive/viral load negative individuals. We systematically eliminated collection site bias, sample integrity, and viral genetic diversity as alternative explanations for undetectable viral loads. Mass spectroscopy unexpectedly detected the presence of 3TC antiviral medication in approximately 60% of those tested (209/354), and negative Western blot results indicated false positive serology in 12% (49/404). From the remaining Western blot positives (n=53) and indeterminates (n=31) with reactive Combo and rapid test results, we estimate 2.7-4.3% of infections in DRC to be potential elite controllers. We also analyzed samples from the DRC collected in 1987 and 2001-03, when antiretroviral drugs were not available, and found similarly elevated trends. Viral suppression to undetectable viral loads without therapy occurs infrequently in HIV-1 infected patients around the world. Mining of global data suggests a unique ability to control HIV infection arose early in central Africa and occurs in <1% of founder populations. Identification of this group of elite controllers presents a unique opportunity to study potentially novel genetic mechanisms of viral suppression.

This article investigates the gut microbiota profile of antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-1 patients and healthy donors living in Latin America in a cohort of 13 HIV positive patients (six elite controllers, EC, and seven non-controllers, NC) and nine healthy donors (HD). Microbiota compositions in stool samples were determined by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA, and functional prediction was inferred using PICRUSt. Several taxa were enriched in EC compared to NC or HD groups, including Acidaminococcus, Clostridium methylpentosum, Barnesiella, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes, and Lachnospiraceae UCG-004. In addition, our data indicate that the route of infection is an important factor associated with changes in gut microbiome composition, and we extend these results by identifying several metabolic pathways associated with each route of infection. Importantly, we observed several bacterial taxa that might be associated with different viral subtypes, such as Succinivibrio, which were more abundant in patients infected by HIV subtype B, and Streptococcus enrichment in patients infected by subtype C. In conclusion, our data brings a significant contribution to the understanding of dysbiosis-associated changes in HIV infection and describes, for the first time, differences in microbiota composition according to HIV subtypes. These results warrant further confirmation in a larger cohort of patients.","2021","2021 Feb 13","Wellinton M do Nascimento; Aline Machiavelli; Luiz G E Ferreira; Luisa Cruz Silveira; Suwellen S D de Azevedo; Gonzalo Bello; Daniel P Smith; Melissa P Mezzari; Joseph F Petrosino; Rubens Tadeu Delgado Duarte; Carlos R Zárate-Bladés; Aguinaldo R Pinto","Laboratório de Imunologia Aplicada, Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Universitário da Trindade, Florianópolis, SC 88034-040, Brazil.; Laboratório de Imunorregulação, iREG, Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Universitário da Trindade, Florianópolis, SC 88034-040, Brazil.; Laboratório de Imunologia Aplicada, Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Universitário da Trindade, Florianópolis, SC 88034-040, Brazil.; Laboratório de Imunorregulação, iREG, Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Universitário da Trindade, Florianópolis, SC 88034-040, Brazil.; Hospital Regional Homero de Miranda Gomes, Rua Adolfo Donato da Silva, s/n, São José, SC 88103-901, Brazil.; Laboratório de Imunologia Aplicada, Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Universitário da Trindade, Florianópolis, SC 88034-040, Brazil.; Laboratório de AIDS e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Av.

We conducted a descriptive, prospective and single-centre study of all HIV-positive adults recorded in the University Hospital database who met the definition criteria for EC. EC were defined as patients having two consecutive undetectable VL without ART for at least one year. Patients were followed from baseline up to December 2019, to the development of a progression event (loss of VL control, CD4+ T cell decline, AIDS or death) or to the censoring date (lost to follow-up or initiation of ART). Predictive models of progression were calculated. Fifty-nine EC were identified with a median follow-up of 17 years contributing 1033 PYFU. The median (95% CI) time duration from HIV-1 diagnosis to disease progression was four (1.7 to 6.3) years. Forty-nine (83%) presented progression to the composite end-point, 44 (74.6%) lost viral control, 39 (66.1%) lost immunological control, two developed AIDS and two died.

Independent predictors of virological progression were sexual risk of HIV-1 acquisition and VL blips during the first year of follow-up (baseline). The only independent predictor detected for progression to a composite end-point was VL blips during the first year of follow-up (baseline). The rate of long-term progression in EC was very high.

The failure to restore proper antiviral CD8A/CD8 T-cell immunity, especially against HIV-1, is still the major limitation of current antiretroviral therapies. Consequently, it is of clinical imperative to provide new strategies to enhance the function of HIV-1-specific CD8A T-cells in patients under antiretroviral treatments (ART). Here, we investigated whether targeting autophagy activity could be an optional solution to make this possible. Our data show that, after both polyclonal and HIV-1-specific activation, CD8A T-cells from ART displayed reduced autophagy-dependent degradation of lysosomal contents when compared to naturally HIV-1 protected elite controllers (EC). We further confirmed in EC, by using specific BECN1 gene silencing and lysosomal inhibitors, the critical role of active autophagy in superior CD8A T-cell protection against HIV-1. More importantly, we found that an IL21 treatment was effective in rescuing the antiviral CD8A T-cell immunity from ART in an autophagy-dependent manner. Finally, we established that IL21-dependent rescue occurred due to the enhanced degradation of endogenous lipids via autophagy, referred to as lipophagy, which fueled the cellular rates of mitochondrial beta-oxidation. In summary, our data show that autophagy/lipophagy can be considered as a therapeutic tool to elicit functional antiviral CD8 T-cell responses. Our results also provide additional insights toward the development of improved T-cell-based prevention and cure strategies against HIV-1.Abbreviations: ART: patients under antiretroviral therapy; BaF: bafilomycin A1; BECN1: beclin 1; CEF: cytomegalo-, Epstein-Barr- and flu-virus peptide pool; Chloro.: chloroquine; EC: elite controllers; FAO: fatty acid beta-oxidation; HIVneg: HIV-1-uninfected control donors; IFNG/IFN-γ: interferon gamma; IL21: interleukin 21; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1.","2021","2021 Nov","Hamza Loucif; Xavier Dagenais-Lussier; Cherifa Beji; Léna Cassin; Hani Jrade; Roman Tellitchenko; Jean-Pierre Routy; David Olagnier; Julien van Grevenynghe","Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS)-Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS)-Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS)-Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS)-Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie.; The Sprott Center for Stem Cell Research, Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada.; Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.; Ottawa Institute of Systems Biology, Ottawa, ON, Canada.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS)-Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie.; Chronic Viral Illness Service and Division of Hematology, McGill University Health Centre, Glen Site, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Department of Biomedicine, Research Center for Innate Immunology, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS)-Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie."

Herein, we analysed the cell-associated HIV-DNA content in two important cell compartments of the HIV reservoir, resting CD4+ T memory (Trm) and peripheral T follicular helper (pTfh) cells, and the association with the residual HIV viremia in individuals with spontaneous HIV replication control (elite controllers, EC group) and in individuals with antiretroviral therapy (ART)-mediated HIV replication control (cART group). A cross-sectional study. Seventeen chronically HIV-infected patients with suppressed HIV replication were included. Cell-associated HIV-DNA was measured by ultrasensitive digital-droplet-PCR in purified Trm and pTfh cells. Residual HIV plasma viremia was quantified using a single-copy assay with a sensitivity of 0.3 HIV-RNA copies/ml. A significant and positive correlation was demonstrated between HIV-DNA levels in pTfh cells and residual plasma viral load (rpVL) (rho = 0.928, P = 0.008) in HIV-positive elite controllers, but not in HIV-positive treated patients, despite the lower levels of cell-associated HIV-DNA found in elite controllers compared with cART patients in pTfh cells [176 (77-882) vs. 608 (361-860) copies/million cells, respectively; P = 0.05]. This association suggests that pTfh cells could have an important contribution to persistent viremia in elite controllers. This could be the consequence of a more limited control of HIV replication in elite controllers with higher transcriptional activity of HIV in pTfh cells of elite controllers than that in cART patients.","2021","2021 Mar 01","Marcial García; Vincent Morcilla; Maria Ángeles Navarrete-Muñoz; Katie Fisher; Alfonso Cabello; Juan Carlos López-Bernaldo; Francisco De La Hera; Carlos Barros; Manuel Fernández-Guerrero; Vicente Estrada; Miguel Górgolas; José Miguel Benito; Sarah Palmer; Norma Rallón","HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; The Westmead Institute for Medical Research, The University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.; HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; The Westmead Institute for Medical Research, The University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.; Hospital Universitario Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Spain.; Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañon, Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Spain.; Hospital Universitario de Móstoles, Móstoles, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Spain.; HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; The Westmead Institute for Medical Research, The University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.; HIV and Viral Hepatitis Research Laboratory, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain."

Proviral DNA is also subjected to the same transcriptional regulation as the host cell genome by its own transcriptional factors, with activating or repressive activity. There is a clear interaction between the presence of transcriptional repressors and a decrease in the rate of HIV replication, promoting gene silencing in infected cells, which serve as viral reservoirs. This represents a major obstacle for HIV eradication. The ZBTB gene family comprises 49 genes that encode transcription factors that have a repressor function in differentiation and development of cells of the lymphopoietic lineage, including the main target cells of HIV, CD4+ T cells. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the expression profile of ZBTB genes in CD4+ T cells of HIV-positive individuals with different levels of infection control. We found upregulation of gene expression of ZBTB4 (p < 0.01), ZBTB7B (p < 0.001), and ZBTB38 (p < 0.05) and downregulation of ZBTB16 (p < 0.01) in HIV-positive patients compared to HIV-negative individuals. Interestingly, in a deeper analysis, we observed that elite controllers had the highest levels of expression of the ZBTB38, ZBTB2, HIC1, ZBTB7A, ZBTB7B (ThPOK) and ZBTB4 genes, showing 2.56- to 7.60-fold upregulation compare to the ART-naïve group.

Target cells used to measure ADCC, AD complement deposition (ADCD), and AD cellular trogocytosis (ADCT) have been either HIV envelope (Env) gp120-coated CEM.NKr.CCR5 cells or HIV infected cell cultures. In HIV infected cell cultures, uninfected bystander cells take up gp120 shed from infected cells. Both gp120-coated and gp120+ bystander cells expose CD4 induced (CD4i) epitopes, which are normally hidden in native trimeric Env expressed by genuinely HIV infected cells since Nef and Vpu downmodulate cell surface CD4. Antibody dependent assays using either of these target cells probe for CD4i Abs that are abundant in HIV+ plasma but that do not recognize HIV-infected cells. Here, we examined ADCC, ADCD, and ADCT functions using a target cell line, sorted HIV-infected cell line cells, whose HIV infection frequency nears 100% and that expresses HIV Env in a native trimeric closed conformation. Using sorted HIV-infected cells (siCEM) as targets, we probed the binding and AD functions of anti-gp120/Env Abs in plasma from HIV-infected untreated progressor (UTP, n = 18) and treated (TP, n = 24) subjects, compared to that in Elite controllers (EC, n = 37) and Viral Controllers (VC, n = 16), which are rare subsets of HIV-infected individuals who maintain undetectable or low VL, respectively, without treatment. Gp120-coated beads were used to measure AD cellular phagocytosis. Equivalent concentrations of input IgG in plasma from UTPs, ECs, and VCs supported higher levels of all AD functions tested than plasma from TPs. When AD activities were normalized to the concentration of anti-gp120/Env-specific Abs, between-group differences largely disappeared. This finding suggests that the anti-gp120/Env Abs concentrations and not their potency determined AD functional levels in these assays. Elite controllers did differ from the other groups by having AD functions that were highly polyfunctional and highly correlated with each other. PCR measurement of HIV reservoir size showed that ADCC activity was higher in ECs and VCs with a reservoir size below the limit of detection compared to those having a measurable HIV reservoir size.","2020","2020","Sanket Kant; Ningyu Zhang; Alexandre Barbé; Jean-Pierre Routy; Cécile Tremblay; Réjean Thomas; Jason Szabo; Pierre Côté; Benoit Trottier; Roger LeBlanc; Danielle Rouleau; Marianne Harris; Franck P Dupuy; Nicole F Bernard","Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Infectious Diseases, Immunology and Global Health Program, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Infectious Diseases, Immunology and Global Health Program, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Faculté de Médecine de l'Université de Lille Henri Warembourg, Lille, France.; Ophthalmology Department, Lille University Hospital, Lille, France.; Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Infectious Diseases, Immunology and Global Health Program, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Division of Hematology, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Départment de Microbiologie Infectiologie et Immunologie, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Clinique Médicale l'Actuel, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Infectious Diseases, Immunology and Global Health Program, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Clinique Médicale l'Actuel, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Clinique de Médecine Urbaine du Quartier Latin, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Clinique de Médecine Urbaine du Quartier Latin, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Clinique Médicale Opus, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Départment de Microbiologie Infectiologie et Immunologie, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; British Columbia Center for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Infectious Diseases, Immunology and Global Health Program, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Infectious Diseases, Immunology and Global Health Program, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Division of Clinical Immunology, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada."

The ability of CD8+ T cells to suppress SIV is suboptimal in the acute phase but increases progressively in controller macaques before the establishment of sustained low-level viremia. Controller macaques develop optimal memory-like SIV-specific CD8+ T cells early after infection. In contrast, a persistently skewed differentiation phenotype characterizes memory SIV-specific CD8+ T cells in non-controller macaques. Accordingly, the phenotype of SIV-specific CD8+ T cells defined early after infection appears to favor the development of protective immunity in controllers, whereas SIV-specific CD8+ T cells in non-controllers fail to gain antiviral potency, feasibly as a consequence of early defects imprinted in the memory pool.","2020","2020 Sep 22","Caroline Passaes; Antoine Millet; Vincent Madelain; Valérie Monceaux; Annie David; Pierre Versmisse; Naya Sylla; Emma Gostick; Sian Llewellyn-Lacey; David A Price; Antoine Blancher; Nathalie Dereuddre-Bosquet; Delphine Desjardins; Gianfranco Pancino; Roger Le Grand; Olivier Lambotte; Michaela Müller-Trutwin; Christine Rouzioux; Jérémie Guedj; Véronique Avettand-Fenoel; Bruno Vaslin; Asier Sáez-Cirión","Institut Pasteur, HIV Inflammation and Persistence, Paris, France; CEA-Université Paris-Saclay, INSERM UMR1184, Center for Immunology of Viral, Auto-immune, Hematologic and Bacterial Diseases, IDMIT Department, IBFJ, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.; Université Paris-Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Faculté de Médecine, EA 7327 Paris, France.; Université Paris-Diderot, IAME, INSERM UMR 1137, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Institut Pasteur, HIV Inflammation and Persistence, Paris, France.; Institut Pasteur, HIV Inflammation and Persistence, Paris, France.; Institut Pasteur, HIV Inflammation and Persistence, Paris, France.; CEA-Université Paris-Saclay, INSERM UMR1184, Center for Immunology of Viral, Auto-immune, Hematologic and Bacterial Diseases, IDMIT Department, IBFJ, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.; Cardiff University School of Medicine, Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff, UK.; Cardiff University School of Medicine, Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff, UK.; Cardiff University School of Medicine, Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff, UK.; Université Paul Sabatier, Laboratoire d'Immunogénétique Moléculaire, EA 3034 Toulouse, France; CHU de Toulouse, Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Toulouse, France.; CEA-Université Paris-Saclay, INSERM UMR1184, Center for Immunology of Viral, Auto-immune, Hematologic and Bacterial Diseases, IDMIT Department, IBFJ, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.; CEA-Université Paris-Saclay, INSERM UMR1184, Center for Immunology of Viral, Auto-immune, Hematologic and Bacterial Diseases, IDMIT Department, IBFJ, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.; Institut Pasteur, HIV Inflammation and Persistence, Paris, France.; CEA-Université Paris-Saclay, INSERM UMR1184, Center for Immunology of Viral, Auto-immune, Hematologic and Bacterial Diseases, IDMIT Department, IBFJ, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.; CEA-Université Paris-Saclay, INSERM UMR1184, Center for Immunology of Viral, Auto-immune, Hematologic and Bacterial Diseases, IDMIT Department, IBFJ, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France; Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Service de Médecine Interne et Immunologie Clinique, Groupe Hospitalier Université Paris-Saclay, Hôpital Bicêtre, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France.; Institut Pasteur, HIV Inflammation and Persistence, Paris, France.; Université Paris-Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Faculté de Médecine, EA 7327 Paris, France; Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Service de Microbiologie Clinique, Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.; Université Paris-Diderot, IAME, INSERM UMR 1137, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Université Paris-Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Faculté de Médecine, EA 7327 Paris, France; Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Service de Microbiologie Clinique, Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.; CEA-Université Paris-Saclay, INSERM UMR1184, Center for Immunology of Viral, Auto-immune, Hematologic and Bacterial Diseases, IDMIT Department, IBFJ, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.

Moreover, the noncytotoxic CD8+ T cell antiviral response is a primary mediator of natural HIV control such as that seen in HIV elite controllers and long-term nonprogressors that does not require combined antiretroviral therapy. In this study, we investigated the biological factors contributing to the noncytotoxic control of HIV replication mediated by primary human CD8+ T cells. We report that canonical Wnt signaling inhibits HIV transcription in an MHC-independent, noncytotoxic manner and that mediators of this pathway correlate with HIV controller clinical status. We show that CD8+ T cells express all 19 Wnts and CD8+ T cell-conditioned medium (CM) induced canonical Wnt signaling in infected recipient cells while simultaneously inhibiting HIV transcription. Antagonizing canonical Wnt activity in CD8+ T cell CM resulted in increased HIV transcription in infected cells. Further, Wnt2b expression was upregulated in HIV controllers versus viremic patients, and in vitro depletion of Wnt2b and/or Wnt9b from CD8+ CM reversed HIV inhibitory activity. Finally, plasma concentration of Dkk-1, an antagonist of canonical Wnt signaling, was higher in viremic patients with lower CD4 counts. This study demonstrates that canonical Wnt signaling inhibits HIV and significantly correlates with HIV controller status.","2020","2020 Oct 15","Jennillee Wallace; Srinivas D Narasipura; Beverly E Sha; Audrey L French; Lena Al-Harthi","Department of Microbial Pathogens and Immunity, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612.; Department of Microbial Pathogens and Immunity, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612.; Stroger Hospital of Cook County, Cook County Health and Hospitals System, Chicago, IL 60612; and.; Ruth M.

Inducing such an ability to spontaneously maintain undetectable plasma viraemia is a major objective of HIV-1 cure research, but the characteristics of proviral reservoirs in elite controllers remain to be determined. Here, using next-generation sequencing of near-full-length single HIV-1 genomes and corresponding chromosomal integration sites, we show that the proviral reservoirs of elite controllers frequently consist of oligoclonal to near-monoclonal clusters of intact proviral sequences. In contrast to individuals treated with long-term antiretroviral therapy, intact proviral sequences from elite controllers were integrated at highly distinct sites in the human genome and were preferentially located in centromeric satellite DNA or in Krüppel-associated box domain-containing zinc finger genes on chromosome 19, both of which are associated with heterochromatin features. Moreover, the integration sites of intact proviral sequences from elite controllers showed an increased distance to transcriptional start sites and accessible chromatin of the host genome and were enriched in repressive chromatin marks. These data suggest that a distinct configuration of the proviral reservoir represents a structural correlate of natural viral control, and that the quality, rather than the quantity, of viral reservoirs can be an important distinguishing feature for a functional cure of HIV-1 infection. Moreover, in one elite controller, we were unable to detect intact proviral sequences despite analysing more than 1.5 billion peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which raises the possibility that a sterilizing cure of HIV-1 infection, which has previously been observed only following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation2,3, may be feasible in rare instances.","2020","2020 Sep","Chenyang Jiang; Xiaodong Lian; Ce Gao; Xiaoming Sun; Kevin B Einkauf; Joshua M Chevalier; Samantha M Y Chen; Stephane Hua; Ben Rhee; Kaylee Chang; Jane E Blackmer; Matthew Osborn; Michael J Peluso; Rebecca Hoh; Ma Somsouk; Jeffrey Milush; Lynn N Bertagnolli; Sarah E Sweet; Joseph A Varriale; Peter D Burbelo; Tae-Wook Chun; Gregory M Laird; Erik Serrao; Alan N Engelman; Mary Carrington; Robert F Siliciano; Janet M Siliciano; Steven G Deeks; Bruce D Walker; Mathias Lichterfeld; Xu G Yu","Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Dental Clinical Research Core, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Accelevir Diagnostics, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Basic Science Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD, USA.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD, USA.; Institute for Medical Engineering and Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA. xyu@mgh.harvard.edu.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. xyu@mgh.harvard.edu."

However, there is a gap in the knowledge about the mechanisms that regulate the expression of such host factors. Here, we aimed to assess DNA methylation impact on host genome in natural HIV-1 control. To this end, whole DNA methylome in 70 untreated HIV-1 infected individuals with either high (>50,000 HIV-1-RNA copies/ml, n = 29) or low (<10,000 HIV-1-RNA copies/ml, n = 41) plasma viral load (pVL) levels were compared and identified 2,649 differentially methylated positions (DMPs). Of these, a classification random forest model selected 55 DMPs that correlated with virologic (pVL and proviral levels) and HIV-1 specific adaptive immunity parameters (IFNg-T cell responses and neutralizing antibodies capacity). Then, cluster and functional analyses identified two DMP clusters: cluster 1 contained hypo-methylated genes involved in antiviral and interferon response (e.g. PARP9, MX1, and USP18) in individuals with high viral loads while in cluster 2, genes related to T follicular helper cell (Tfh) commitment (e.g. CXCR5 and TCF7) were hyper-methylated in the same group of individuals with uncontrolled infection. For selected genes, mRNA levels negatively correlated with DNA methylation, confirming an epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Further, these gene expression signatures were also confirmed in early and chronic stages of infection, including untreated, cART treated and elite controllers HIV-1 infected individuals (n = 37). These data provide the first evidence that host genes critically involved in immune control of the virus are under methylation regulation in HIV-1 infection. These insights may offer new opportunities to identify novel mechanisms of in vivo virus control and may prove crucial for the development of future therapeutic interventions aimed at HIV-1 cure.","2020","2020 Aug","Bruna Oriol-Tordera; Maria Berdasco; Anuska Llano; Beatriz Mothe; Cristina Gálvez; Javier Martinez-Picado; Jorge Carrillo; Julià Blanco; Clara Duran-Castells; Carmela Ganoza; Jorge Sanchez; Bonaventura Clotet; Maria Luz Calle; Alex Sánchez-Pla; Manel Esteller; Christian Brander; Marta Ruiz-Riol","IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institute for Health Science Research Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.; Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.; Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Spain.; IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institute for Health Science Research Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.; IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institute for Health Science Research Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.; University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia, Catalonia, Vic, Spain.; Fundació Lluita contra la Sida, Infectious Disease Department, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.; IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institute for Health Science Research Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.; IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institute for Health Science Research Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.; University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia, Catalonia, Vic, Spain.; Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.; IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institute for Health Science Research Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.; IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institute for Health Science Research Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.; University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia, Catalonia, Vic, Spain.; IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institute for Health Science Research Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.; Asociación Civil IMPACTA Salud y Educacion, Lima, Peru.; Alberto Hurtado School of Medicine, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru.; Asociación Civil IMPACTA Salud y Educacion, Lima, Peru.; Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.; Centro de Investigaciones Tecnológicas, Biomédicas y Medioambientales, CITBM, Lima, Peru.; IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institute for Health Science Research Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.; University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia, Catalonia, Vic, Spain.; Fundació Lluita contra la Sida, Infectious Disease Department, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.; University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia, Catalonia, Vic, Spain.; Statistics Department, Biology Faculty, University of Barcelona, Spain.; Statistics and Bioinformatics Unit Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca (VHIR), Spain.; Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Spain.; Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.; Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain.; Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.; IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institute for Health Science Research Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.; University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia, Catalonia, Vic, Spain.; Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.; AELIX Therapeutics, Barcelona, Spain.; IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institute for Health Science Research Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain."

The main purposes of this work are to describe the miRNome of HIV-1 infected patients with different extreme phenotypes and identify potentially altered pathways regulated by differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs. The miRNomes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of dual phenotype EC-LTNP or LTNP with detectable viremia and HIV-infected patients with typical progression before and after treatment, were obtained through miRNA-Seq and compared among them. The administration of treatment produces 18 DE miRNAs in typical progressors. LTNP condition shows 14 DE miRNA when compared to typical progressors, allowing LTNP phenotype differentiation. A set of four miRNAs: miR-144-3p, miR-18a-5p, miR-451a, and miR-324 is strongly downregulated in LTNP and related to protein regulation as AKT, mTOR, ERK or IKK, involved in immune response pathways. Deregulation of 28 miRNA is observed between EC-LTNP and viremic-LTNP, including previously described anti-HIV miRNAs: miR-29a, associated with LTNP phenotype, and miR-155, targeting different pre-integration complexes such as ADAM10 and TNPO3.

However, it is also known that viral infections can modify cellular DNA methylation patterns. Therefore, changes in the methylation of cytosine-guanine (CpG) islands might modulate progression of HIV infection. In total, 85 samples were analyzed: 21 elite controllers (EC), 21 subjects with HIV before combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) (viremic, 93 325 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [HIV-1] RNA copies/mL) and under suppressive cART (cART, median of 17 months, <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL), and 22 HIV-negative donors (HIVneg). We analyzed the methylation pattern of 485 577 CpG in DNA from peripheral CD4+ T lymphocytes. We selected the most differentially methylated gene (TNF) and analyzed its specific methylation, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, and plasma protein levels in 5 individuals before and after initiation of cART. We observed 129 methylated CpG sites (associated with 43 gene promoters) for which statistically significant differences were recorded in viremic versus HIVneg, 162 CpG sites (55 gene promoters) in viremic versus cART, 441 CpG sites (163 gene promoters) in viremic versus EC, but none in EC versus HIVneg. The TNF promoter region was hypermethylated in viremic versus HIVneg, cART, and EC. Moreover, we observed greater plasma levels of TNF in viremic individuals than in EC, cART, and HIVneg. Our study shows that genome methylation patterns vary depending on HIV infection status and progression profile and that these variations might have an impact on controlling HIV infection in the absence of cART.","2021","2021 May 04","Sara Moron-Lopez; Victor Urrea; Judith Dalmau; Miguel Lopez; Maria C Puertas; Dan Ouchi; Antonio Gómez; Caroline Passaes; Beatriz Mothe; Christian Brander; Asier Saez-Cirion; Bonaventura Clotet; Manel Esteller; Maria Berdasco; Javier Martinez-Picado","AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.; AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.; AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.; Cancer Epigenetics Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.; Epigenetic Therapies Group, Experimental and Clinical Hematology Program, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.; AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.; AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.; Cancer Epigenetics Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.; Institut Pasteur, Unité HIV, Inflammation et Persistence, Paris, France.; AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.; Fundació Lluita Contra la Sida, University Hospital ""Germans Trias i Pujol,"" Badalona, Spain.; University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia (UVic-UCC), Barcelona, Spain.; AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.; University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia (UVic-UCC), Barcelona, Spain.; Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.; Institut Pasteur, Unité HIV, Inflammation et Persistence, Paris, France.; AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.; Fundació Lluita Contra la Sida, University Hospital ""Germans Trias i Pujol,"" Badalona, Spain.; University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia (UVic-UCC), Barcelona, Spain.; Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.; Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain.; Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), Badalona, Spain.; Cancer Epigenetics Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.; Epigenetic Therapies Group, Experimental and Clinical Hematology Program, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.; AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.; University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia (UVic-UCC), Barcelona, Spain.; Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain."

In elite controllers and viremia controllers, viral replication is naturally controlled, with maintenance of CD4+TC levels without the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The aim of the present study was to describe virological and immunological risk factors among HIV-1-infected individuals according to characteristics of progression to AIDS. The sample included 30 treatment-naive patients classified into three groups based on infection duration (> 6 years), CD4+TC count and viral load: (i) 2 elite controllers (ECs), (ii) 7 viremia controllers (VCs) and (iii) 21 nonviremia controllers (NVCs). Nested PCR was employed to amplify the virus genome, which was later sequenced using the Ion PGM platform for subtyping and analysis of immune escape mutations. Viral samples were classified as HIV-1 subtypes B and F. Greater selection pressure on mutations was observed in the group of viremia controllers, with a higher frequency of immunological escape mutations in the genes investigated, including two new mutations in gag. The viral sequences of viremia controllers and nonviremia controllers did not differ significantly regarding the presence of immune escape mutations. The results suggest that progression to AIDS is not dependent on a single variable but rather on a set of characteristics and pressures exerted by virus biology and interactions with immunogenetic host factors.","2020","2020 Jul 25","Samara Tatielle Monteiro Gomes; Ednelza da Silva Graça Amoras; Érica Ribeiro Gomes; Maria Alice Freitas Queiroz; Edivaldo Costa Sousa Júnior; Janaína Mota de Vasconcelos Massafra; Poliana da Silva Lemos; João Lídio Vianez Júnior; Ricardo Ishak; Antonio Carlos Rosário Vallinoto","Laboratory of Virology, Biological Science Institute, Federal University of Pará (ICB/UFPA), Ananindeua, Brazil.; Graduate Program in Biology of Infectious and Parasitic Agents, Biological Science Institute, Federal University of Pará, Ananindeua, Brazil.; Laboratory of Virology, Biological Science Institute, Federal University of Pará (ICB/UFPA), Ananindeua, Brazil.; Laboratory of Virology, Biological Science Institute, Federal University of Pará (ICB/UFPA), Ananindeua, Brazil.; Laboratory of Virology, Biological Science Institute, Federal University of Pará (ICB/UFPA), Ananindeua, Brazil.; Health Surveillance Department, Ministry of Health (IEC-SVS/MS), Evandro Chagas Institute, Ananindeua, Brazil.; Health Surveillance Department, Ministry of Health (IEC-SVS/MS), Evandro Chagas Institute, Ananindeua, Brazil.; Health Surveillance Department, Ministry of Health (IEC-SVS/MS), Evandro Chagas Institute, Ananindeua, Brazil.; Health Surveillance Department, Ministry of Health (IEC-SVS/MS), Evandro Chagas Institute, Ananindeua, Brazil.; Laboratory of Virology, Biological Science Institute, Federal University of Pará (ICB/UFPA), Ananindeua, Brazil.; Laboratory of Virology, Biological Science Institute, Federal University of Pará (ICB/UFPA), Ananindeua, Brazil. vallinoto@me.com."

A few HIV-infected individuals, 'elite controllers', generate a stable Th1, cytotoxic T lymphocyte response that contains the virus. Most infected individuals, in the absence of therapy, first generate a similarly protective response that evolves with time a Th2 component, associated with antibody production and loss of viral control. Cessation of anti-retroviral treatment after three years results in viral rebound in most, but about one in seven individuals contains the virus, so-called post-treatment controllers. We suggest an understanding, of how the Th1/Th2 phenotype of immune responses is controlled, can explain these different outcomes and leads us to propose a non-invasive, personalized strategy of immunotherapy. We propose that monitoring the relative prevalence of HIV-1 specific IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies can provide a biomarker for deciding when to interrupt/withdraw anti-retroviral therapy to optimally harness protective immunity.","2020","2020 Dec","Peter A Bretscher; Ghassan Al-Yassin","Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada."

TRIM5α targets the HIV capsid for proteosomal destruction. Cyclophilin A, an intracellular protein has also been reported to influence HIV infectivity in a cell-specific manner. Accordingly, variations in TRIM5α and Cyclophilin A genes have been documented to influence HIV-1 disease progression. However, these variations have not been documented among Elite controllers in Uganda and whether they play a role in viral suppression remains largely undocumented. Our study focused on identifying the variations in TRIM5α and Cyclophilin A genes among HIV-1 Elite controllers and non-controllers in Uganda. From the sequence analysis, the rs10838525 G > A mutation in exon 2 of TRIM5α was only found among elite controllers (30%) while the rs3824949 in the 5'UTR was seen among 25% of the non-controllers. In the Cyclophilin A promoter, rs6850 was seen among 62.5% of the non-controllers and only among 10% elite controllers. Furthermore, rs17860048 in the Cyclophillin A promoter was predominantly seen among elite controllers (30%) and 12.5% non-controllers. From gene expression analysis, we noted that the respective genes were generally elevated among elite controllers, however, this difference was not statistically significant (TRIM5α p = 0.6095; Cyclophilin A p = 0.6389). Variations in TRIM5α and Cyclophillin A promoter may influence HIV viral suppression. The rs10838525 SNP in TRIM5α may contribute to viral suppression among HIV-1 elite controllers. The rs6850 in the cyclophillin A gene may be responsible for HIV-1 rapid progression among HIV-1 non-controllers. These SNPs should be investigated mechanistically to determine their precise role in HIV-1 viral suppression.","2020","2020 Jul 06","Sharon Bright Amanya; Brian Nyiro; Francis Waswa; Bonniface Obura; Rebecca Nakaziba; Eva Nabulime; Ashaba Fred Katabazi; Rose Nabatanzi; Alice Bayiyana; Gerald Mboowa; Alex Kayongo; Misaki Wayengera; Obondo J Sande","Faculty of Health Sciences, Lira University, Lira, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Lira University, Lira, Uganda.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Lira University, Lira, Uganda.; Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Lab, Joint Clinical Research Center, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.; The African Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Data Intensive Sciences, the Infectious Diseases Institute, McKinnell Knowledge Centre, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.; Makerere University Lung Institute, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda. ojsande@gmail.com."

Several studies showed that CDKN1A/p21 is expressed at high levels ex vivo in cells from individuals who naturally control HIV-1 replication (HIC) and a recent study supports a coordinate regulation of ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 and CDKN1A/p21 transcripts in a model of renal carcinoma cells. Here, we explored the potential associations between mRNA expression of ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 and CDKN1A/p21 in HIC sustaining undetectable (elite controllers-EC) or low (viremic controllers-VC) viral loads. We found a selective upregulation of ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 and CDKN1A/p21 mRNA levels in PBMC from HIC compared with both ART-suppressed and HIV-negative control groups (P≤ 0.02) and higher MCPIP1 and p21 proteins levels in HIC than in HIV-1 negative subjects. There was a moderate positive correlation (r ≥ 0.57; P ≤ 0.014) between expressions of both transcripts in HIC and in HIC combined with control groups. We found positive correlations between the mRNA level of CDKN1A/p21 with activated CD4+ T cells levels in HIC (r ≥ 0.53; P ≤ 0.017) and between the mRNA levels of both CDKN1A/p21 (r = 0.74; P = 0.005) and ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 (r = 0.58; P = 0.040) with plasmatic levels of sCD14 in EC. Reanalysis of published transcriptomic data confirmed the positive association between ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 and CDKN1A/p21 mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells and monocytes from disparate cohorts of HIC and other HIV-positive control groups. These data show for the first time the simultaneous upregulation of ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 and CDKN1A/p21 transcripts in the setting of natural suppression of HIV-1 replication in vivo and the positive correlation of the expression of these cellular factors in disparate cohorts of HIV-positive individuals. The existence of a common regulatory pathway connecting ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 and CDKN1A/p21 could have a synergistic effect on HIV-1 replication control and pharmacological manipulation of these multifunctional host factors may open novel therapeutic perspectives to prevent HIV-1 replication and disease progression.","2020","2020 Jul 02","Suwellen S D de Azevedo; Marcelo Ribeiro-Alves; Fernanda H Côrtes; Edson Delatorre; Lucia Spangenberg; Hugo Naya; Leonardo N Seito; Brenda Hoagland; Beatriz Grinsztejn; Valdilea G Veloso; Mariza G Morgado; Thiago Moreno L Souza; Gonzalo Bello","Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz-IOC, FIOCRUZ, Av.

We examine the cellular origin of plasma microvesicles (MVs), a type of ectocytosis-derived EV, the presence of mitochondria in MVs, and their relationship to circulating cell-free mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (ccf-mtDNA) in HIV-infected patients and controls. Five participant groups were defined: 30 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive; 30 ART-treated with nondetectable viremia; 30 elite controllers; 30 viremic controllers; and 30 HIV-uninfected controls. Microvesicles were quantified and characterized from plasma samples by flow cytometry. MitoTrackerDeepRed identified MVs containing mitochondria and ccf-mtDNA was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Microvesicle numbers were expanded at least 10-fold in all HIV-infected groups compared with controls. More than 79% were platelet-derived MVs. Proportions of MVs containing mitochondria (22.3% vs 41.6%) and MV mitochondrial density (706 vs 1346) were significantly lower among HIV-infected subjects than controls, lowest levels for those on ART.

In this study, we studied the evolution of the Ab repertoire over the first year of HIV infection in people classified as rapid progressors (RP) compared with typical progressors. HIV RPs are an important yet understudied group of HIV patients classified by a rapid decline in CD4 counts and accelerated development of AIDS. We found that the global IgG somatic hypermutation load negatively correlated with disease progression, possibly because of exaggerated isotype switching of unmutated sequences in patients with low CD4 counts. We measured Ab sequence evolution over time using longitudinal samples taken during the early stages of infection and 1 year postinfection. Within clonal lineages spanning both timepoints, visit 2-derived sequences harbored considerably more mutations than their visit 1 relatives. Despite extensive ongoing somatic hypermutation, the initially strong signs of Ag selection pressure observed in visit 1-derived sequences decayed by visit 2. These data suggest that excessive immune activation in RPs leads to a hyperactive B cell response that fails to confer protection.","2020","2020 Aug 01","Ben S Wendel; Yajing Fu; Chenfeng He; Stefany M Hernandez; Mingjuan Qu; Zining Zhang; Yongjun Jiang; Xiaoxu Han; Junjie Xu; Haibo Ding; Ning Jiang; Hong Shang","McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering, Cockrell School of Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712.; Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health Commission (China Medical University), Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.; National Clinical Research Center for Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cockrell School of Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712; and.; McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering, Cockrell School of Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cockrell School of Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712; and.; Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health Commission (China Medical University), Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.; National Clinical Research Center for Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.; Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health Commission (China Medical University), Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.; National Clinical Research Center for Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.; Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health Commission (China Medical University), Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.; National Clinical Research Center for Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.; Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health Commission (China Medical University), Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.; National Clinical Research Center for Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.; Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health Commission (China Medical University), Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.; National Clinical Research Center for Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cockrell School of Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712; and hongshang100@hotmail.com jiang@austin.utexas.edu.; Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712.; Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health Commission (China Medical University), Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China; hongshang100@hotmail.com jiang@austin.utexas.edu.; National Clinical Research Center for Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China."
"141","32582872","Antiretroviral Treatment for HIV Elite Controllers?","Pathogens & immunity","","Cardiovascular Disease; Elite Control; HIV; Immune Activation; Inflammation; Transmission","In most HIV-infected persons, the natural history of untreated infection is one of sustained viremia, progressive CD4 T cell depletion with resultant morbidity and mortality. The advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) that controls HIV replication has altered this landscape dramatically. Yet a rare population of HIV-infected persons-elite controllers (EC)-can control HIV replication such that plasma levels of virus are ""undetectable"" without ART. The EC phenotype is heterogeneous, with some subjects durably controlling the virus-persistent elite controllers-and some eventually losing viral control-transient elite controllers. Overall, EC tend to have robust HIV-specific T cell responses and in some cases, mainly in transient elite controllers, elevated activation and inflammation indices that diminish with ART suggesting that endogenous defenses against this persistent pathogen come at the cost of heightened activation/inflammation. A limited data set suggests that cardiovascular disease risk as well as the occur-rence of other morbid events may be greater in the overall EC population than in treated HIV infection. ART in EC decreases activation indices but does not appear to increase circulating CD4 T cell numbers nor do we know if it alters clinical outcomes. Thus, it is difficult to recommend or discourage a decision to start ART in the EC population but the authors lean toward treatment particularly in those EC whose activation indices are high and those who are progressively losing circulating CD4 T cell numbers. Biomarkers that can reliably predict loss of virologic control and immune failure are needed.","2020","2020","Ezequiel Ruiz-Mateos; Eva Poveda; Michael M Lederman","Clinic Unit of Infectious Diseases; Microbiology and Preventive Medicine; Institute of Biomedicine of Seville; Virgen del Rocío University Hospital/CSIC/University of Seville, Spain.; Group of Virology and Pathogenesis; Galicia Sur Health Research Institute (IIS Galicia Sur)-Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Vigo; SERGAS-UVigo; Vigo, Spain.; Division of Infectious Diseases; Center for AIDS Research; Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals; Cleveland Medical Center; Cleveland, Ohio."

The expression level of miR-146 in HIV/HCV co-infected patients was the highest in all groups. The miRNAs expression profile was significantly different in patient groups compared to control and EC. Some miRNA was significantly correlated with viral load and CD4 T cell count. The involvement of the mentioned miRNAs and correlation of these with viral and cellular parameters can justify the clinical outcome of all patient groups.

This is the first study analyzing the transcriptional profile of Trm cells, in two well-characterized groups of HIV patients with distinct mechanisms of viral replication control (spontaneous versus treatment-induced). We use a systems biology approach to unravel subtle but important differences in the molecular mechanisms operating at the cellular level that could be associated with the host's ability to control virus replication and persistence. Despite the absence of significant differences in the transcriptome of Trm cells between Elite Controllers (ECs) and cART-treated (TX) patients at the single gene level, we found 353 gene ontology (GO) categories upregulated in EC compared with TX. Our results suggest the existence of mechanisms at two different levels: first boosting both adaptive and innate immune responses, and second promoting active viral replication and halting HIV latency in the Trm cell compartment of ECs as compared with TX patients. These differences in the transcriptional profile of Trm cells could be involved in the lower HIV reservoir observed in ECs compared with TX individuals, although mechanistic studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Combining transcriptome analysis and systems biology methods is likely to provide important findings to help us in the design of therapeutic strategies aimed at purging the HIV reservoir. KEY MESSAGES: HIV-elite controllers have the lowest HIV-DNA content in resting memory CD4 T cells. HIV-ECs show a particular transcriptional profile in resting memory CD4 T cells.

Among the latter a region placed in the 3' untranslated region of HLA-C transcript contains the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs67384697 ""G-ins/del"" that has been found to be strictly associated with surface levels of HLA-C allomorphs because of the effect on the binding site of a microRNA (Hsa-miR-148a).

Studies on gene expression and regulation in these individuals are limited but significant, and have helped researchers and clinicians to understand the interrelationships between HIV and its host. We collected CD4 T-cell samples from two elite controllers (ECs), two HIV-positive infected patients (HPs), and two healthy controls (HCs) to perform second-generation transcriptome sequencing. Using the Cufflinks software, we calculated the Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million fragments mapped (FPKM) and identified differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), with corrected P value < 0.05 (based on a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). We then constructed a protein-protein interaction network using cytoHubba and a long non-coding RNA-mRNA co-expression network based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. In total, 1109 linear correlations of DE lncRNAs targeting DE mRNAs were found and several interesting interactions were identified as being associated with viral infections and immune responses within the networks based on these correlations. Among these lncRNA-mRNA relationships, hub mRNAs including HDAC6, MAPK8, MAPK9, ATM and their corresponding annotated co-expressed lncRNAs presented strong correlations with the MAPK-NF-kappa B pathway, which plays a role in the reactivation and replication of the virus. Using RNA-sequencing, we systematically analyzed the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs from CD4+ T cells from ECs, HPs, and HCs, and constructed a co-expression network based on the relationships among DE transcripts and database annotations.

Detecting and quantifying these HIV-1-specific CTL responses will be crucial for developing vaccine and T cell-based immunotherapies. A recently developed assay, called MANAFEST, uses T cell receptor (TCR) Vβ sequencing of peptide-stimulated cultures followed by a bioinformatic pipeline to identify neoantigen-specific T cells in cancer patients. This assay is more sensitive than conventional immune assays and therefore has the possibility to identify HIV-1 antigenic targets that have not been previously explored for vaccine or T cell immunotherapeutic strategies. Here we show that a modified version of the MANAFEST assay, called ViraFEST, can identify memory CD8+ T cell responses against autologous HIV-1 Gag and Nef epitope variants in an elite suppressor. Nine TCR Vβ clonotypes were identified and 6 of these were cross-reactive for autologous variants or known escape variants.

There are a few studies on molecular epidemiology of B19V and its association with anemia in Iran. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the B19V DNA, IgM, IgG, genotyping, and viral load in HIV patients in different groups of pregnant women, general population, injection drug users (IDU), and Elite controllers. Also, the possible association of B19V with anemia was studied. Methods: In this case-control study, B19V DNA, anti-B19V IgM, anti-B19V IgG, viral load, and hemoglobin level were assessed in 113 HIV positive patients and 72 healthy controls. Also, CD4+ T cell counts and HIV load were measured in the patients' group. All statistical analyses were done using STATA 14.2 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA). P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Among HIV patients, 19 (16.8%) cases had B19V DNA, 3 (2.7%) had B19V IgM, and 7 (6.2%) had B19V IgG. In control group, the prevalence of B19V DNA, IgM, and IgG was 6 (8.33%), 7(9.7%), and 19 (26.4%), respectively. In subpopulations based on transmission routes, general population had the highest B19V IgG and DNA positivity prevalence and viral load level.

The HLA-B*57 allele is overrepresented in ES suggesting a role for HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in immune control. Natural killer (NK) cells also play a role in controlling viral replication, and genetic studies demonstrate that specific combinations of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) alleles and HLA subtypes including HLA-B*57 correlate with delayed progression to AIDS. While prior studies have shown that both HIV-specific CD8+ T cells and NK cells can inhibit viral replication in vitro, the interaction between these two effector cells has not been studied. We performed in vitro suppression assays using CD8+ T cells and NK cells from HLA-B*57 ES either alone or in combination with each other. We found no evidence of antagonism or synergy between the CD8+ T cells and NK cells, suggesting that they have independent mechanisms of inhibition in vitro.

We analyzed three EEC, diagnosed between 1988 and 1992, who never showed signs of clinical disease progression in absence of any antiretroviral treatment. A comprehensive clinical, virological, and immunological study was performed. The individuals simultaneously exhibited ≥3 described host protective alleles, low levels of total HIV-1 DNA (<20 copies/106 CD4+ T-cells) without evidence of replication-competent viruses (<0.025 IUPM), consistent with high levels of defective genomes, strong cellular HIV-1-specific immune response, and a high poly-functionality index (>0.50). Inflammation levels of EEC were similar to HIV-1 negative donors. Remarkably, they showed an exceptional lack of viral evolution and 8-fold lower genetic diversity (<0.01 s/n) in env gene than other EC. We postulate that these EEC represent cases of spontaneous functional HIV-1 cure.

However, some individuals called HIV controllers (HICs) present spontaneous control of viral replication and have a more preserved immune system. Among HICs, discordant results have been observed regarding immune activation and the frequency of different T cell subsets, including Treg and Th17 cells. We evaluated T cell immune activation, differentiation and regulatory profiles in two groups of HICs-elite controllers (ECs) and viremic controllers (VCs)-and compared them to those of cART-treated individuals (cART) and HIV-1-negative (HIV-neg) individuals. ECs demonstrated similar levels of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in comparison to HIV-neg, while cART and VCs showed elevated T cell activation. CD4+ T cell subset analyses showed differences only for transitional memory T cell frequency between the EC and HIV-neg groups. However, VC individuals showed higher frequencies of terminally differentiated, naïve, and stem cell memory T cells and lower frequencies of transitional memory and central memory T cells compared to the HIV-neg group. Among CD8+ T cell subsets, ECs presented higher frequencies of stem cell memory T cells, while VCs presented higher frequencies of terminally differentiated T cells compared to the HIV-neg group. HICs showed lower frequencies of total Treg cells compared to the HIV-neg and cART groups. ECs also presented higher frequencies of activated and a lower frequency of resting Treg cells than the HIV-neg and cART groups. Furthermore, we observed a high frequency of Th17 cells in ECs and high Th17/Treg ratios in both HIC groups. Our data showed that ECs had low levels of activated T cells and a high frequency of activated Treg and Th17 cells, which could restrict chronic immune activation and be indicative of a preserved mucosal response in these individuals.","2020","2020","Diogo G Caetano; Hury H S de Paula; Gonzalo Bello; Brenda Hoagland; Larissa M Villela; Beatriz Grinsztejn; Valdilea G Veloso; Mariza G Morgado; Monick L Guimarães; Fernanda H Côrtes","Laboratório de AIDS e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz-IOC, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de AIDS e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz-IOC, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de AIDS e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz-IOC, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas-INI, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas-INI, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas-INI, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas-INI, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de AIDS e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz-IOC, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de AIDS e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz-IOC, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de AIDS e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz-IOC, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."

This study investigated the frequency of four HIV-1-associated BST2 variants rs3217318, rs12609479, rs10415893 and rs113189798 in uninfected and HIV-1 infected black South Africans. Homozygosity for the rs12609479-A minor allele, previously associated with decreased HIV-1 acquisition risk, was underrepresented in HIV-1 uninfected black South Africans (2%) compared to reference African (9%) and in particular European populations (61%) (p = .047 and p < .0001, respectively). To determine if any of these gene variants influenced HIV-1 control in the absence of antiretroviral treatment (ART), we compared HIV-1 infected ART-naïve progressors [n = 72] and controllers [n = 71], the latter includes elite controllers [EC: n = 23; VL < 50 RNA copies/ml].

However, viral replication occurs predominantly in secondary lymphoid tissues, such as lymph nodes (LNs). We used an integrated single-cell approach to characterize effective HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in the LNs of elite controllers (ECs), defined as individuals who suppress viral replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Higher frequencies of total memory and follicle-homing HIV-specific CD8+ T cells were detected in the LNs of ECs compared with the LNs of chronic progressors (CPs) who were not receiving ART. Moreover, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells potently suppressed viral replication without demonstrable cytolytic activity in the LNs of ECs, which harbored substantially lower amounts of CD4+ T cell-associated HIV DNA and RNA compared with the LNs of CPs. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses further revealed a distinct transcriptional signature among HIV-specific CD8+ T cells from the LNs of ECs, typified by the down-regulation of inhibitory receptors and cytolytic molecules and the up-regulation of multiple cytokines, predicted secreted factors, and components of the protein translation machinery. Collectively, these results provide a mechanistic framework to expedite the identification of novel antiviral factors, highlighting a potential role for the localized deployment of noncytolytic functions as a determinant of immune efficacy against HIV.","2019","2019 Dec 18","Son Nguyen; Claire Deleage; Samuel Darko; Amy Ransier; Duc P Truong; Divyansh Agarwal; Alberto Sada Japp; Vincent H Wu; Leticia Kuri-Cervantes; Mohamed Abdel-Mohsen; Perla M Del Rio Estrada; Yuria Ablanedo-Terrazas; Emma Gostick; James A Hoxie; Nancy R Zhang; Ali Naji; Gustavo Reyes-Terán; Jacob D Estes; David A Price; Daniel C Douek; Steven G Deeks; Marcus Buggert; Michael R Betts","Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; AIDS and Cancer Virus Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Leidos Biomedical Research Inc., Frederick, MD 21702, USA.; Human Immunology Section, Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.; Human Immunology Section, Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.; Department of Mathematics, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75205, USA.; Department of Statistics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Departamento de Investigación en Enfermedades Infecciosas, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias, Mexico City 14080, Mexico.; Departamento de Investigación en Enfermedades Infecciosas, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias, Mexico City 14080, Mexico.; Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff CF14 4XN, UK.; Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Statistics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Surgery, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Departamento de Investigación en Enfermedades Infecciosas, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias, Mexico City 14080, Mexico.; Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.; Division of Pathobiology and Immunology, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.; Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff CF14 4XN, UK.; Human Immunology Section, Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA.; Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. betts@pennmedicine.upenn.edu."

The most important disease progression hallmarks are immune activation and apoptosis. In this study, we address the prevalence of polymorphisms related to proinflammatory and apoptotic genes, such as IFNG (+874T/A), TNF (308G/A), IL6 (-174G/C), IL8 (-251A/T), FAS (-670A/G), and FASL (-124A/G) in 160 ethnically mixed HIV-1-infected patients from multicentre cohorts with different clinical outcomes (13 elite controllers [EC], 66 slow long-term non-progressors [LTNPs], and 81 progressors [P]). The genotyping was accomplished by TaqMan-qPCR. Among all the polymorphisms analyzed in the cytokines, the IL6 -174G/C polymorphism showed a higher frequency of GG genotype in the LTNP and LTNP+EC groups as compared to the P group. Moreover, there was a significantly higher frequency of the G allele in the LTNP and LTNP+EC groups as compared to the P group. On the other hand, the levels of CD4+ T lymphocytes were higher among individuals showing the AA and AG genotypes for the FASL -124A/G polymorphism as compared to the GG genotype. Furthermore, the AG and AA genotypes were more frequent, as compared to the GG genotype, in individuals showing a lower viral load. In contrast, for the FAS -670A/G polymorphism, a significantly higher viral load was observed in individuals with the AG genotype as compared to the GG genotype. In conclusion, we found three genetic allelic variants of the IL6 -174G/C, FASL -124A/G, and FAS -670A/G polymorphisms that were related to disease progression and immunological and virological markers in cohorts of HIV-1-positive ethnically mixed patients.","2020","2020 Aug","Marília M Loureiro Dos Reis; Maria A F Queiroz; Bosco C M da Silva; Alberto J da Silva Duarte; Jorge Casseb; Gustavo A Arganaraz; Antonio C R Vallinoto; Enrique R Argañaraz","Laboratory of Molecular Neurovirology, Faculty of Health Science, University of Brasília, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.; Virus Laboratory, Institute of Biological Science, Federal University of Para, Belém, PA, Brazil.; Medical Investigation Laboratory Unit 56 (LIM/56), Faculdade de Medicina FMUSP, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Medical Investigation Laboratory Unit 56 (LIM/56), Faculdade de Medicina FMUSP, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of São Paulo.; Laboratory of Molecular Neurovirology, Faculty of Health Science, University of Brasília, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.; Virus Laboratory, Institute of Biological Science, Federal University of Para, Belém, PA, Brazil.; Laboratory of Molecular Neurovirology, Faculty of Health Science, University of Brasília, Brasilia, DF, Brazil."

NLRP3 inflammasome provides a first-line defense in viral infections, and, accordingly, gain-of-function variants in NLRP3 have been associated with protection against HIV-1. Despite antiretroviral treatment (ART), HIV-infected patients continue to present systemic inflammation with a heterogeneous prognosis. As NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in several chronic diseases by amplifying ""sterile"" inflammation, its role in chronic phase of HIV infection has been postulated. Little is known about inflammasome genetics in HIV-infected patients and whether it may play a role in the different clinical outcomes. Therefore, we questioned whether NLRP3 inflammasome genetics could affect the clinical course of HIV-1 infection as it does in host/virus interaction. For this purpose, we analyzed selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ART-treated HIV-infected patients (n = 300), in Long Term Non-Progressors/Elite Controllers and progressors (n = 133), and in HIV-infected individuals submitted to dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy (n = 19). SNPs leading to increased activation of NLRP3 inflammasome are beneficial for patients, while SNPs that negatively affect NLRP3 activation or IL-18 production, detrimental. In contrast, gain-of-function variant in IL1B is also detrimental for patients, suggesting that while IL-1ß possible contributes to immune exhaustion, the axis NLRP3-inflammasome/IL-18 could act positively in chronic infection. Functional assays supported genetic results: NLRP3 variants associated with good quality HIV+ DC, and IL1B -511C > T with a poor one. Loss-of-function SNPs affect HIV+ T cells proliferation. These findings proposed for the first time that NLRP3 inflammasome, mainly through IL-18, play a protective role in chronic HIV infection.","2019","2019 Dec","Edione C Reis; Vinicius N C Leal; Lais T da Silva; Marilia M L Dos Reis; Enrique R Argañaraz; Telma M Oshiro; Alessandra Pontillo","Laboratório de Imunogenética, Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas, Universidade de São Paulo/USP, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Laboratório de Imunogenética, Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas, Universidade de São Paulo/USP, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Laboratório de Investigação em Dermatologia e Imunodeficiências - LIM 56, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de São Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Laboratório de Virologia Molecular, Faculdade de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade de Brasília/UNB, Brasília, DF, Brazil.; Laboratório de Virologia Molecular, Faculdade de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade de Brasília/UNB, Brasília, DF, Brazil.; Laboratório de Investigação em Dermatologia e Imunodeficiências - LIM 56, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de São Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Laboratório de Imunogenética, Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas, Universidade de São Paulo/USP, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.

However, there is a paucity of longitudinal data detailing the viral and immune dynamics or HIV reservoir seeding during acute infection in individuals that go on to become Elite Controllers. In this report, we describe a case of a 42 year old woman diagnosed during acute infection who rapidly and permanently suppressed her viremia in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Rapid antibody/antigen testing was either negative or equivocal during acute infection, despite subsequent viral load testing at that time point with 71,550 plasma HIV RNA copies/mL, making initial diagnosis challenging. The patient subsequently developed detectable anti-HIV antibodies and an increase in HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses to overlapping subtype C HIV gag peptide; very low-level plasma viremia (0.84 RNA copies/mL) was detected by an ultrasensitive assay 2 years following infection. Subsequently, she was started on ART for multifocal furunculosis despite continued suppression of virus and stable CD4+ T cell counts. Following ART initiation, HIV specific antibody levels and CD8+ T cell responses increased, but no HIV DNA or RNA was able to be isolated from large numbers of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells. This case provides important information regarding the establishment of elite HIV control during acute infection and also demonstrates an increase in HIV-specific immune responses following ART despite undetectable peripheral blood cellular measures of HIV persistence. This case also highlights the challenges in diagnosing acute HIV infection without the use of viral load testing in this rare elite controller phenotype.","2019","2019 Sep 18","Deirdre Morley; John S Lambert; Louise E Hogan; Cillian De Gascun; Niamh Redmond; Rachel L Rutishauser; Cassandra Thanh; Erica A Gibson; Kristen Hobbs; Sonia Bakkour; Michael P Busch; Jeremy Farrell; Padraig McGetrick; Timothy J Henrich","Mater Misericordae University Hospital, Eccles Street, Dublin, 7, Ireland. deemorley@gmail.com.; Mater Misericordae University Hospital, Eccles Street, Dublin, 7, Ireland.; University College Dublin School of Medicine, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco Division of Experimental Medicine, 1001 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, CA, 94110, USA.; National Virus Reference Laboratory, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.; UCD Clinical Research Centre, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco Division of Experimental Medicine, 1001 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, CA, 94110, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco Division of Experimental Medicine, 1001 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, CA, 94110, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco Division of Experimental Medicine, 1001 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, CA, 94110, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco Division of Experimental Medicine, 1001 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, CA, 94110, USA.; Vitalant Research Institute, 270 Masonic Ave, San Francisco, CA, 94118, USA.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Vitalant Research Institute, 270 Masonic Ave, San Francisco, CA, 94118, USA.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Mater Misericordae University Hospital, Eccles Street, Dublin, 7, Ireland.; Mater Misericordae University Hospital, Eccles Street, Dublin, 7, Ireland.; Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco Division of Experimental Medicine, 1001 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, CA, 94110, USA."

The ongoing global HIV/AIDS pandemic has already claimed over 35 million lives. Even after 37 years into the epidemic, neither a cure is available for the 37 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) nor is a vaccine discovered to avert the millions of new HIV infections that continue to occur each year. If left untreated, HIV infection typically progresses to AIDS and, ultimately, causes death in a majority of PLHIV. The recommended combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppresses virus replication and viremia, prevents or delays progression to AIDS, reduces transmission rates, and lowers HIV-associated mortality and morbidity. However, because cART does not eliminate HIV, and an enduring pool of infected resting memory CD4+ T cells (latent HIV reservoir) is established early on, any interruption to cART leads to a relapse of viremia and disease progression. Hence, strict adherence to a life-long cART regimen is mandatory for managing HIV infection in PLHIV. The HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T cells expressing the CD8 glycoprotein (CD8+ CTL) limit the virus replication in vivo by recognizing the viral antigens presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules on the infected cell surface and killing those cells. Nevertheless, CTLs fail to durably control HIV-1 replication and disease progression in the absence of cART. Intriguingly, <1% of cART-naive HIV-infected individuals called elite controllers/HIV controllers (HCs) exhibit the core features that define a HIV-1 ""functional cure"" outcome in the absence of cART: durable viral suppression to below the limit of detection, long-term non-progression to AIDS, and absence of viral transmission. Robust HIV-1-specific CTL responses and prevalence of protective HLA alleles associated with enduring HIV-1 control have been linked to the HC phenotype. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the CTL-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication and disease progression in HCs carrying specific protective HLA alleles may yield promising insights towards advancing the research on HIV cure and prophylactic HIV vaccine.","2019","2019 Jun","Muthukumar Balasubramaniam; Jui Pandhare; Chandravanu Dash","Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN - 37208.

These cells were dramatically increased in chronic HIV infection. CD57 expression correlated with cytolytic granules, granzyme B and perforin expression. They express lower CCR5 compared to CD57- cells, have less HIV total DNA, and were a minor component of the HIV reservoir.

Long term non progressors (LTNP) represent only the 2% of infected patients but are especially relevant because of their efficient HIV control. In this work we present a global analysis of genetic data in the large national multicenter cohort of Spanish LTNP, which is compared with seronegative individuals and HIV-positive patients. We have analyzed whether several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including in key genes and certain HLA-A and B alleles could be associated with a specific HIV phenotype. A total of 846 individuals, 398 HIV-1-positive patients (213 typical progressors, 55 AIDS patients, and 130 LTNPs) and 448 HIV-negative controls, were genotyped for 15 polymorphisms and HLA-A and B alleles. Significant differences in the allele frequencies among the studied populations identified 16 LTNP-associated genetic factors, 5 of which were defined for the first time as related to LTNP phenotype: the protective effect of HLA-B39, and the detrimental impact of HLA-B18, -A24, -B08 and -A29. The remaining eleven polymorphisms confirmed previous publications, including the protective alleles HLA-B57, rs2395029 (HCP5), HLA bw4 homozygosity, HLA-B52, HLA-B27, CCR2 V64I, rs9264942 (HLA-C) and HLA-A03; and the risk allele HLA bw6 homozygosity. Notably, individual Spanish HIV-negative individuals had an average of 0.12 protective HLA alleles and SNPs, compared with an average of 1.43 protective alleles per LTNP patient, strongly suggesting positive selection of LTNP. Finally, stratification of LTNP according to viral load showed a proportional relationship between the frequency of protective alleles with control of viral load. Interestingly, no differences in the frequency of protection/risk polymorphisms were found between elite controllers and LTNPs maintaining viral loads <2.000 copies/mL throughout the follow-up.","2019","2019","Eva Ramírez de Arellano; Francisco Díez-Fuertes; Francisco Aguilar; Humberto Erick de la Torre Tarazona; Susana Sánchez-Lara; Yolanda Lao; José Luis Vicario; Felipe García; Juan González-Garcia; Federico Pulido; Félix Gutierrez-Rodero; Santiago Moreno; Jose Antonio Iribarren; Pompeyo Viciana; Carlos Vilches; Manuel Ramos; Laura Capa; José Alcamí; Margarita Del Val","National Center for Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; National Center for Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; Infectious Diseases Unit, IBIDAPS, HIVACAT, Hospital Clínic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; National Center for Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; National Center for Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; National Center for Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; Viral Immunology, Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.; National Center for Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; Departamento de Histocompatibilidad, Centro de Transfusión de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.; Infectious Diseases Unit, IBIDAPS, HIVACAT, Hospital Clínic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain.; HIV Unit, Instituto de Investigación Hospital 12 de Octubre (i+12), Madrid, Spain.; Servicio de Medicina Interna, Unidad de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Hospital General Universitario de Elche, Alicante, Spain.; Infectious Diseases, Hospital Ramón y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario de Donostia, San Sebastián, Spain.; Laboratory of Immunovirology, Biomedicine Institute of Sevilla, Virgen del Rocío University Hospital, Clinic Unit of Infectious Diseases, Microbiology and Preventive Medicine, IBIS/CSIC/SAS/University of Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain.; Inmunogenética e Histocompatibilidad, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Puerta de Hierro, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; National Center for Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; Viral Immunology, Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.; National Center for Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; National Center for Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; Infectious Diseases Unit, IBIDAPS, HIVACAT, Hospital Clínic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; National Center for Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; Viral Immunology, Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain."

However, the potential mechanisms that affecting NK-mediated ADCC response are still not well-elucidated. Methods: Antigen-antibody complex model of Ab-opsonized P815 cells was adopted to induce a typical non-specific ADCC response. The capacities of HIV-1 specific NK-ADCC were measured by using the combination model of gp120 protein and plasma of HIV-1 elite controllers. The levels of plasma cytokine were measured by ELISA. Anti-IL-2 blocking antibody was used to analyze the impact of activated CD56+ T cells on NK-ADCC response. Results: IL-2, IL-15, IFN-α, and IFN-β could effectively enhance the non-specific and HIV-1-specific NK-ADCC responses. Compared with healthy controls, HIV-1-infected patients showed decreased plasma IL-2 levels, while no differences of plasma IFN-α, IL-15, and IFN-β were presented. IL-2 production was detected from CD56+ T cells activated through antibody-dependent manner. The capability of NK-ADCC could be weakened by blocking IL-2 secretion from activated CD56+ T cells.

We performed genome-wide transcriptional analyses and functional assays of CD4+ T cells specific for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from HIV-infected people before and after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). A follicular helper T cell (TFH cell)-like profile characterized HIV-specific CD4+ T cells in viremic infection. HIV-specific CD4+ T cells from people spontaneously controlling the virus (elite controllers) robustly expressed genes associated with the TH1, TH17 and TH22 subsets of helper T cells. Viral suppression by ART resulted in a distinct transcriptional landscape, with a reduction in the expression of genes associated with TFH cells, but persistently low expression of genes associated with TH1, TH17 and TH22 cells compared to the elite controller profile. Thus, altered differentiation is central to the impairment of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells and involves both gain of function and loss of function.","2019","2019 Aug","Antigoni Morou; Elsa Brunet-Ratnasingham; Mathieu Dubé; Roxanne Charlebois; Eloi Mercier; Sam Darko; Nathalie Brassard; Krystelle Nganou-Makamdop; Sahaana Arumugam; Gabrielle Gendron-Lepage; Lifei Yang; Julia Niessl; Amy E Baxter; James M Billingsley; Premeela A Rajakumar; François Lefebvre; R Paul Johnson; Cécile Tremblay; Jean-Pierre Routy; Richard T Wyatt; Andrés Finzi; Daniel C Douek; Daniel E Kaufmann","Research Centre of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Research Centre of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Research Centre of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, La Jolla, CA, USA.; Research Centre of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Canadian Centre for Computational Genomics-Montréal Node, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Human Immunology Section, Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Research Centre of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Human Immunology Section, Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Human Immunology Section, Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Research Centre of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.; Research Centre of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, La Jolla, CA, USA.; Research Centre of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, La Jolla, CA, USA.; University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Yerkes National Primate Research Center and Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Yerkes National Primate Research Center and Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Canadian Centre for Computational Genomics-Montréal Node, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Yerkes National Primate Research Center and Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Research Centre of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illnesses Service and Division of Hematology, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, La Jolla, CA, USA.; Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.; Research Centre of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Human Immunology Section, Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Research Centre of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. daniel.kaufmann@umontreal.ca.; Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. daniel.kaufmann@umontreal.ca.; Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, La Jolla, CA, USA. daniel.kaufmann@umontreal.ca."

We have described a splice variant called TRAILshort, which is a dominant negative ligand that antagonizes TRAIL-induced cell death in the context of HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 elite controllers naturally control viral replication for largely unknown reasons. Since enhanced death of infected cells might be responsible, as might occur in situations of low (or inhibited) TRAILshort, we tested whether there was an association between elite controller status and reduced levels of TRAILshort expression. Cohort study comparing TRAILshort and full length TRAIL expression between HIV-1 elite controllers and viremic progressors from two independent populations. TRAILshort and TRAIL gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was determined by RNA-seq. TRAILshort and TRAIL protein expression in plasma was determined by antibody bead array and proximity extension assay respectively. HIV-1 elite controllers expressed less TRAILshort transcripts in PBMCs (P = 0.002) and less TRAILshort protein in plasma (P < 0.001) than viremic progressors. Reduced TRAILshort expression in PBMCs and plasma is associated with HIV-1 elite controller status.","2019","2019 Sep 01","Ana C Paim; Nathan W Cummins; Sekar Natesampillai; Enrique Garcia-Rivera; Nicole Kogan; Ujjwal Neogi; Anders Sönnerborg; Maike Sperk; Gary D Bren; Steve Deeks; Eric Polley; Andrew D Badley","Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.; Nference, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Nference, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Division of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.; Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.; Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA."

HIV Env, the only viral protein expressed on the surface of infected cells, has a native trimeric closed conformation on cells infected with wild-type HIV. However, CD4+ uninfected bystander cells in HIV+ cell cultures bind gp120 shed from HIV+ cells exposing CD4-induced epitopes normally hidden in native Env. We used flow-cytometry based assays to quantify antibodies in HIV+ plasma specific for native trimeric Env or gp120/CD4 conjugates using CEM.NKr.CCR5 (CEM) cells infected with HIV (iCEM) or coated with recombinant gp120 (cCEM), as a surrogate for gp120+ HIV- bystander cells. Results from both assays were compared to those of a plate-based ELISA to monomeric gp120. The levels of Env-specific antibodies to cCEM and iCEM, measured by flow cytometry, and to gp120 by ELISA were positively correlated. More antibodies in HIV+ plasma recognized the gp120 conformation exposed on cCEM than on iCEM. Comparisons of plasma from untreated progressors, treated progressors, and elite controllers revealed that antibodies to Env epitopes were the lowest in treated progressors.

We use PCR and sequencing analysis to characterize pericentromeric K111 proviruses in DNA from individuals of diverse ethnicities and patients with different diseases. We found that the 5' LTR-gag region of K111 proviruses is missing in certain individuals, creating pericentromeric instability. K111 deletion (-/- K111) is seen in about 15% of Caucasian, Asian, and Middle Eastern populations; it is missing in 2.36% of African individuals, suggesting that the -/- K111 genotype originated out of Africa. As we identified the -/-K111 genotype in Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cell lines, we studied whether the -/-K111 genotype is associated with CTCL. We found a significant increase in the frequency of detection of the -/-K111 genotype in Caucasian patients with severe CTCL and/or Sézary syndrome (n = 35, 37.14%), compared to healthy controls (n = 160, 15.6%) [p = 0.011]. The -/-K111 genotype was also found to vary in HIV-1 infection. Although Caucasian healthy individuals have a similar frequency of detection of the -/- K111 genotype, Caucasian HIV Long-Term Non-Progressors (LTNPs) and/or elite controllers, have significantly higher detection of the -/-K111 genotype (30.55%; n = 36) than patients who rapidly progress to AIDS (8.5%; n = 47) [p = 0.0097]. Our data indicate that pericentromeric instability is associated with more severe CTCL and/or Sézary syndrome in Caucasians, and appears to allow T-cells to survive lysis by HIV infection. These findings also provide new understanding of human evolution, as the -/-K111 genotype appears to have arisen out of Africa and is distributed unevenly throughout the world, possibly affecting the severity of HIV in different geographic areas.","2019","2019 May 02","Mark H Kaplan; Mark Kaminski; Judith M Estes; Scott D Gitlin; Joseph Zahn; James T Elder; Trilokraj Tejasvi; Elizabeth Gensterblum; Amr H Sawalha; Joseph Patrick McGowan; Michael H Dosik; Haner Direskeneli; Guher Saruhan Direskeneli; Sally N Adebamowo; Clement A Adebamowo; Mohammad Sajadi; Rafael Contreras-Galindo","Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.; Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Hospital, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, USA.; Division of Dermatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.; Division of Dermatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.; Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Hospital, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, USA.; Division of Dermatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.; Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Hospital, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, The Feinstein Institute for Medical research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA.; Hematology Oncology Associates, Setauket, NY, 11776, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, School of Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.; Department of Physiology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.; Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.; Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.; Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.; Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.; Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA. rafaelc@med.umich.edu.; Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, 55912, USA. rafaelc@med.umich.edu."

However, some EC experience CD4+ T cell loss and/or lose their ability to control HIV-1 over the course of infection. High levels of HIV-1 env proviral diversity, activated T cells and proinflammatory cytokines were pointed out as relevant biomarkers for detection of EC at risk of virologic/immunologic progression. The aim of this study was to assess the importance of proviral diversity as a prognostic marker of virologic and/or immunologic progression in EC. To this end, we analyzed plasma viremia, total HIV DNA levels, T cells dynamics, and activation/inflammatory biomarkers in EC with low (ECLD = 4) and high (ECHD = 6) HIV-1 env diversity. None of ECLD and ECHD subjects displayed evidence of immunologic progression (decrease in absolute and percentage of CD4+ T cells) and only one ECHD subject presented virologic progression (≥2 consecutive viral loads measurements above the detection limit) 2-5 years after determination of proviral env diversity. Despite differences in proviral genetic diversity, the ECLD and ECHD subgroups displayed comparable levels of total cell-associated HIV DNA, activated CD8+ T (CD38+HLA-DR+) cells and plasmatic inflammatory biomarkers (IP-10, IL-18, RANTES, PDGF-AA, and CTACK). These results indicate that the genetic diversity of the HIV-1 proviral reservoir is not a surrogate marker of residual viral replication, immune activation or inflammation, nor an accurate biomarker for the prediction of virologic breakthrough or CD4+ T cells loss in EC.","2019","2019","Suwellen S D de Azevedo; Fernanda H Côrtes; Edson Delatorre; Marcelo Ribeiro-Alves; Brenda Hoagland; Beatriz Grinsztejn; Valdilea G Veloso; Mariza G Morgado; Gonzalo Bello","Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST e AIDS, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST e AIDS, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST e AIDS, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST e AIDS, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."

Recently, immunovirological and proteomic factors have been associated to the loss of spontaneous control. Our aim was to perform a metabolomic approach to identify the underlying mechanistic pathways and potential biomarkers associated with this loss of control. Plasma samples from EC who spontaneously lost virological control (Transient Controllers, TC, n = 8), at two and one year before the loss of control, were compared with a control group of EC who persistently maintained virological control during the same follow-up period (Persistent Controllers, PC, n = 8). The determination of metabolites and plasma lipids was performed by GC-qTOF and LC-qTOF using targeted and untargeted approaches. Metabolite levels were associated with the polyfunctionality of HIV-specific CD8+T-cell response. Our data suggest that, before the loss of control, TCs showed a specific circulating metabolomic profile characterized by aerobic glycolytic metabolism, deregulated mitochondrial function, oxidative stress and increased immunological activation. In addition, CD8+ T-cell polyfunctionality was strongly associated with metabolite levels. Finally, valine was the main differentiating factor between TCs and PCs. All these metabolomic differences should be considered not only as potential biomarkers but also as therapeutic targets in HIV infection.

Plasma levels of CXCL13 have been reported to be elevated during chronic HIV-infection, however there is limited data on such elevation during early phases of infection and on the effect of ART. Moreover, the contribution of CXCL13 to disease progression and systemic immune activation have been partially defined. Herein, we assessed the relationship between plasma levels of CXCL13 and systemic immune activation. Methods: Study samples were collected in 114 people living with HIV (PLWH) who were in early (EHI) or chronic (CHI) HIV infection and 35 elite controllers (EC) compared to 17 uninfected controls (UC). A subgroup of 11 EHI who initiated ART and 14 who did not were followed prospectively. Plasma levels of CXCL13 were correlated with CD4 T cell count, CD4/CD8 ratio, plasma viral load (VL), markers of microbial translocation [LPS, sCD14, and (1→3)-β-D-Glucan], markers of B cell activation (total IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgG1-4), and inflammatory/activation markers like IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, TNF-α, IDO-1 activity, and frequency of CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Results: Plasma levels of CXCL13 were elevated in EHI (127.9 ± 64.9 pg/mL) and CHI (229.4 ± 28.5 pg/mL) compared to EC (71.3 ± 20.11 pg/mL), and UC (33.4 ± 14.9 pg/mL). Longitudinal analysis demonstrated that CXCL13 remains significantly elevated after 14 months without ART (p < 0.001) and was reduced without normalization after 24 months on ART (p = 0.002). Correlations were observed with VL, CD4 T cell count, CD4/CD8 ratio, LPS, sCD14, (1→3)-β-D-Glucan, total IgG, TNF-α, Kynurenine/Tryptophan ratio, and frequency of CD38+HLA-DR+ CD4 and CD8 T cells. In addition, CMV+ PLWH presented with higher levels of plasma CXCL13 than CMV- PLWH (p = 0.005). Conclusion: Plasma CXCL13 levels increased with HIV disease progression. Early initiation of ART reduces plasma CXCL13 and B cell activation without normalization. CXCL13 represents a novel marker of systemic immune activation during early and chronic HIV infection and may be used to predict the development of non-AIDS events.","2019","2019","Vikram Mehraj; Rayoun Ramendra; Stéphane Isnard; Franck P Dupuy; Bertrand Lebouché; Cecilia Costiniuk; Réjean Thomas; Jason Szabo; Jean-Guy Baril; Benoit Trottier; Pierre Coté; Roger LeBlanc; Madéleine Durand; Carl Chartrand-Lefebvre; Ido Kema; Yonglong Zhang; Malcolm Finkelman; Cécile Tremblay; Jean-Pierre Routy","Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Infectious Diseases and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; University of Montreal Hospital Health Centre (CRCHUM), Montreal, QC, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Infectious Diseases and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Infectious Diseases and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Infectious Diseases and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Infectious Diseases and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Department of Family Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Infectious Diseases and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Clinique Médicale l'Actuel, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Clinique Médicale Quartier Latin, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Clinique Médicale Quartier Latin, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Clinique Médicale Quartier Latin, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Clinique Médicale Quartier Latin, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Clinique Médicale OPUS, Montreal, QC, Canada.; University of Montreal Hospital Health Centre (CRCHUM), Montreal, QC, Canada.; University of Montreal Hospital Health Centre (CRCHUM), Montreal, QC, Canada.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Medical Center, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.; Associates of CapeCod Inc., Falmouth, MA, United States.; Associates of CapeCod Inc., Falmouth, MA, United States.; University of Montreal Hospital Health Centre (CRCHUM), Montreal, QC, Canada.; Département de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Infectious Diseases and Immunity in Global Health Program, Research Institute, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Hematology Clinic, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada."

To examine the possible contribution of virus attenuation to elite control, we obtained a primary HIV-1 isolate from an elite controller who had been infected for 19 years, the last 10 of which were in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Full-length sequencing of this isolate revealed a highly unusual V1 domain in Envelope (Env). The V1 domain in this HIV-1 strain was 49 amino acids, placing it in the top 1% of lengths among the 6,112 Env sequences in the Los Alamos National Laboratory online database. Furthermore, it included two additional N-glycosylation sites and a pair of cysteines suggestive of an extra disulfide loop. Virus with this Env retained good infectivity and replicative capacity; however, analysis of recombinant viruses suggested that other sequences in Env were adapted to accommodate the unusual V1 domain. While the long V1 domain did not confer resistance to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies of the V1/V2-glycan-dependent class, it did confer resistance to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies of the V3-glycan-dependent class. Our findings support results in the literature that suggest a role for long V1 regions in shielding HIV-1 from recognition by V3-directed broadly neutralizing antibodies. In the case of the elite controller described here, it seems likely that selective pressures from the humoral immune system were responsible for driving the highly unusual polymorphisms present in this HIV-1 Envelope.IMPORTANCE Elite controllers have long provided an avenue for researchers to reveal mechanisms underlying control of HIV-1. While the role of host genetic factors in facilitating elite control is well known, the possibility of infection by attenuated strains of HIV-1 has been much less studied. Here we describe an unusual viral feature found in an elite controller of HIV-1 infection and demonstrate its role in conferring escape from monoclonal antibodies of the V3-glycan class. Our results suggest that extreme variation may be needed by HIV-1 to escape neutralization by some antibody specificities.","2019","2019 May 15","Zachary A Silver; Gordon M Dickinson; Michael S Seaman; Ronald C Desrosiers","Medical Scientist Training Program, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA.; Department of Pathology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA.; Infectious Diseases Section, Miami Veterans Affairs Health Care System, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA.; Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA.; Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Pathology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA r.desrosiers@med.miami.edu."

CD8+ T cells are a critical component of HIV control in many immunological controllers. NK cells are also believed to have a role in controlling HIV infection, though their role is less well characterized. We used mass cytometry to simultaneously measure the levels of expression of 24 surface markers on peripheral NK cells from HIV-infected subjects with various degrees of HIV natural control; we then used machine learning to identify NK cell subpopulations that differentiate HIV controllers from noncontrollers. Using CITRUS (cluster identification, characterization, and regression), we identified 3 NK cell subpopulations that differentiated subjects with chronic HIV viremia (viremic noncontrollers [VNC]) from individuals with undetectable HIV viremia without ART (elite controllers [EC]). In a parallel approach, we identified 11 NK cell subpopulations that differentiated HIV-infected subject groups using k-means clustering after dimensionality reduction by t-neighbor stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Among these additional 11 subpopulations, the frequencies of 5 correlated with HIV DNA levels; importantly, significance was retained in 2 subpopulations in analyses that included only cohorts without detectable viremia. By comparing the surface marker expression patterns of all identified subpopulations, we revealed that the CD11b+ CD57- CD161+ Siglec-7+ subpopulation of CD56dim CD16+ NK cells are more abundant in EC and HIV-negative controls than in VNC and that the frequency of these cells correlated with HIV DNA levels. We hypothesize that this population may have a role in immunological control of HIV infection.IMPORTANCE HIV infection results in the establishment of a stable reservoir of latently infected cells; ART is usually required to keep viral replication under control and disease progression at bay, though a small subset of HIV-infected subjects can control HIV infection without ART through immunological mechanisms. In this study, we sought to identify subpopulations of NK cells that may be involved in the natural immunological control of HIV infection. We used mass cytometry to measure surface marker expression on peripheral NK cells. Using two distinct semisupervised machine learning approaches, we identified a CD11b+ CD57- CD161+ Siglec-7+ subpopulation of CD56dim CD16+ NK cells that differentiates HIV controllers from noncontrollers.

Efforts have been made to understand the determinants of the nonprogressive status, exemplified by the clinical course of elite controllers (ECs) who maintain an undetectable viremia and viremic nonprogressors (VNPs) who have a normal CD4+ count in spite of circulating viral load. However, the intrinsic mechanism underlying nonprogression remained elusive. In this study, we performed an integrative analysis of transcriptional profiles to pinpoint the underlying mechanism for a naturally occurring viral control. Three microarray datasets, reporting mRNA expression of the LTNPs or ECs in HIV-infected patients, were retrieved from Gene Expression Ominbus (GEO) or Arrayexpress databases. These datasets, profiled on the same type of microarray chip, were selected and merged by a bioinformatic approach to build a meta-analysis derived transcriptome (MADNT). In addition, we investigated the different transcriptional pathways and potential biomarkers in CD4+ and CD8+ cells in ECs and whole blood in VNPs compared to HIV progressors. The combined transcriptome and each subgroup was subject to gene set enrichment analysis and weighted co-expression network analysis to search potential transcription patterns related to the non-progressive status. 30 up-regulated genes and 83 down-regulated genes were identified in lymphocytes from integrative meta-analysis of expression data. The interferon response and innate immune activation was reduced in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from ECs. Several characteristic genes including CMPK1, CBX7, EIF3L, EIF4A and ZNF395 were indicated to be highly correlated with viremic control. Besides that, we indicated that the reduction of ribosome components and blockade of translation facilitated AIDS disease progression. Most interestingly, among VNPs who have a relatively high viral load, we detected a two gene-interaction networks which showed a strong correlation to immune control even with a rigorous statistical threshold (p value = 2-e4 and p value = 0.004, respectively) by WGCNA. We have identified differentially expressed genes and transcriptional patterns in ECs and VNPs compared to normal chronic HIV-infected individuals.

However, the mechanism of stable disease progression in LTNPs and ECs needs to be elucidated to help those infected with HIV-1 remain healthy. In this study, to identify the characteristics of gene expression profiles and biomarkers in LTNPs, we performed a meta-analysis using multiple gene expression profiles among LTNPs, individuals infected with HIV-1 without ART, individuals infected with HIV-1 with ART, and healthy controls. The gene expression profiles obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray data repositories were classified into three groups: LTNPs versus healthy controls (first group, 3 studies), LTNPs versus patients infected with HIV-1 without ART (second group, 3 studies), and LTNPs versus patients infected with HIV-1 with ART (third group, 3 studies). In addition, we considered a fourth group, patients infected with HIV-1 without ART versus healthy controls (3 studies), to exclude genes associated with HIV-1 infection in the three groups. For each group, we performed a meta-analysis using the RankProd method to identify and compare the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the three groups. We identified the 14 common DEGs in the three groups when comparing them with each other. Most belonged to immune responses, antigen processing and presentation, the interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway, and T cell co-stimulation. Of these DEGs, PHLDA1 was up-regulated and ACTB and ACTG1 were down-regulated in all three groups. However, the rest of the up- or down-regulated genes were discordant in the three groups. Additionally, ACTB and ACTG1 are known to inhibit viral assembly and production, and THBS1 is known to inhibit HIV-1 infection.

We performed deep phenotyping of CMV-specific T cells to predict CMV outcomes following allogeneic HCT. By using 13-color flow cytometry, we studied ex vivo CD8+ T-cell cytokine production in response to CMV-pp65 peptides in 3 clinically distinct subgroups of CMV-seropositive HCT patients: (1) Elite Controllers (n = 19): did not have evidence of CMV DNAemia on surveillance testing; (2) Spontaneous Controllers (n = 16): spontaneously resolved low-grade CMV DNAemia without antiviral therapy; and (3) Noncontrollers (NC; n = 21): experienced clinically significant CMV. Two CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell functional subsets were strongly associated with risk of CMV: (i) the nonprotective signature (NPS; IL-2-IFN-γ+TNF-α-MIP-1β+), found at increased levels among NC; and (ii) the protective signature (PS; IL-2+IFN-γ+TNF-α+MIP-1β+) found at low levels among NC. High levels of the NPS and low levels of PS were associated with an increased 100-day cumulative incidence of clinically significant CMV infection (35% vs 5%; P = .02; and 40% vs 12%; P = .05, respectively). The highest predictive value was observed when these signatures were combined into a composite biomarker consisting of low levels of the PS and high levels of the NPS (67% vs 10%; P < .001). After adjusting for steroid use or donor type, this composite biomarker remained associated with a fivefold increase in the risk of clinically significant CMV infection. CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytokine signatures with robust predictive value for risk of CMV reactivation should prove useful in guiding clinical decision making in HCT recipients.","2019","2019 Feb 21","Jose F Camargo; Eric D Wieder; Erik Kimble; Cara L Benjamin; Despina S Kolonias; Deukwoo Kwon; Xi Steven Chen; Krishna V Komanduri","Division of Infectious Diseases and.; Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.; Adult Stem Cell Transplant Program, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL.; Department of Medicine, Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, FL; and.; Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.; Adult Stem Cell Transplant Program, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL.; Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.; Adult Stem Cell Transplant Program, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL.; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL.; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL.; Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.; Adult Stem Cell Transplant Program, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL."

The immune cell receptor SLAMF7 has been shown to be upregulated in diseases characterized by chronic immune activation. In this study, we studied the function of the SLAMF7 receptor in immune cells of HIV patients and the impacts of SLAMF7 signaling on peripheral immune activation. We observed increased frequencies of SLAMF7+ PBMCs in HIV+ individuals in a clinical phenotype-dependent manner, with discordant and long-term nonprogressor patients showing elevated SLAMF7 levels, and elite controllers showing levels comparable to healthy controls. We also noted that SLAMF7 was sensitive to IFN-⍺ stimulation, a factor elevated during HIV infection. Further studies revealed SLAMF7 to be a potent inhibitor of the monocyte-derived proinflammatory chemokine CXCL10 (IP-10) and other CXCR3 ligands, except in a subset of HIV+ patients termed SLAMF7 silent (SF7S). Studies utilizing small molecule inhibitors revealed that the mechanism of CXCL10 inhibition is independent of known SLAMF7 binding partners. Furthermore, we determined that SLAMF7 activation on monocytes is able to decrease their susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in vitro via downregulation of CCR5 and upregulation of the CCL3L1 chemokine. Finally, we discovered that neutrophils do not express SLAMF7, are CXCL10+ at baseline, are able to secrete CXCL10 in response to IFN-⍺ and LPS, and are nonresponsive to SLAMF7 signaling. These findings implicate the SLAMF7 receptor as an important regulator of IFN-⍺-driven innate immune responses during HIV infection.","2019","2019 Jan 01","Patrick O'Connell; Yuliya Pepelyayeva; Maja K Blake; Sean Hyslop; Robert B Crawford; Michael D Rizzo; Cristiane Pereira-Hicks; Sarah Godbehere; Linda Dale; Peter Gulick; Norbert E Kaminski; Andrea Amalfitano; Yasser A Aldhamen","Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.; Center for Integrative Toxicology, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.; Department of Osteopathic Medical Specialties, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.; Department of Osteopathic Medical Specialties, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.; Center for Integrative Toxicology, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.; Department of Pediatrics, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824; and.; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824; aldhamen@msu.edu.; College of Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824."

We hypothesized that I-FABP would be increased in chronically HIV-infected patents more than elite controllers and would relate to specific nutrient intake and body composition. In an observational study, serum I-FABP was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anthropometric measurements, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and single-slice abdominal computed tomography were obtained to assess body composition, as well as visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue areas (VAT and SAT). Dietary intake was assessed using 4-day food records. One hundred forty-nine people with chronic HIV (65% male, 47 ± 7 years of age, 54.7% white, and 14 ± 6 years of known HIV), 10 elite controllers (60% male, 53 ± 8 years, 60% white, and 20 ± 7 years of known HIV), and 69 HIV-negative controls (59.4% male, 46 ± 7 years, and 52.2% white) were included in the analysis. I-FABP was significantly higher in HIV progressors relative to HIV-negative controls and elite controllers. In the chronic HIV group, I-FABP was positively associated with dietary intake of added sugar and with saturated fatty acids. I-FABP was inversely associated with body mass index, VAT, and SAT. I-FABP also correlated with MCP-1, CXCL10, sCD163, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) among all participants. I-FABP was increased among chronically HIV-infected patients to a greater degree than in elite controllers and was related to nutrient intake and body composition in HIV progressors.

We previously reported that the vasodilator neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), secreted upon activation of sensory peripheral neurons that innervate all mucosal epithelia, significantly inhibits transinfection. To investigate the association between CGRP and HIV-1 during infection, we evaluated circulating CGRP levels in HIV-1-infected patients. Plasma was obtained from combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-naive or cART-treated patients with primary/acute (PHI) or chronic (CHI) HIV-1 infection, as well as from individuals who naturally control HIV-1 infection, namely exposed seronegatives (ESNs), elite controllers (ECs), and long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs). CGRP plasma levels were measured using an enzyme immunoassay. Compared with healthy HIV-1-negative controls, CGRP plasma levels significantly decreased in PHI patients and even further in CHI patients, but remained unchanged in ESNs, ECs, and LTNPs. Moreover, CGRP plasma levels were restored to baseline upon cART in both PHI and CHI. Finally, CGRP plasma levels directly correlated with CD4+ T cell counts and inversely with viral loads. Altogether, CGRP could serve as a novel diagnostic plasma biomarker for progression of HIV-1 infection. Moreover, administration of CGRP to cART-naive HIV-1-infected patients, to compensate for CGRP decline, could help controlling on-going HIV-1 infection.","2019","2019 Jan","Morgane Bomsel; Lucia Lopalco; Caterina Uberti-Foppa; Gabriel Siracusano; Yonatan Ganor","1 Laboratory of Mucosal Entry of HIV-1 and Mucosal Immunity, Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, Cochin Institute, CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France.; 2 INSERM U1016, Paris, France.; 3 Paris Descartes University, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France.; 4 Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.; 5 Department of Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.; 4 Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.; 1 Laboratory of Mucosal Entry of HIV-1 and Mucosal Immunity, Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, Cochin Institute, CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France.; 2 INSERM U1016, Paris, France.; 3 Paris Descartes University, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France."

However, T-cells are capable of producing many more functions than just IFN-γ, some of which, like Perforin, are associated with immune protection in HIV-1 disease elite controllers. We evaluated the extent of missed T-cell functions when IFN-γ secretion is used as a surrogate marker for further evaluation of T-cell functions. Intracellular cytokine staining assay and flow cytometry were used to assess peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 31 HIV-infected ART-naive individuals for the extent to which gated CD4+ and CD8+ IFN-γ producing and non-producing T-cells also secreted IL-2, Perforin, and TNF-α functions. Similarly, the extent of missed virus-specific responses in IFN-γ ELISpot assay negative T-cells from 5 HIV-1 uninfected individuals was evaluated. Cells from HIV-infected individuals were stimulated with pooled consensus group M (Con M) peptides; and those from healthy individuals were stimulated with pooled adenovirus (Ad) peptides. Overall, frequencies of virus-specific IFN-γ secreting CD4+ and CD8+ cells were low. Proportions of IFN-γ negative CD4+ expressing IL-2, Perforin, or TNF-α to Con M were significantly higher (5 of 7 functional profiles) than the corresponding IFN-γ positive CD4+ (0 of 7) T-cell phenotype, p = 0.02; Fisher's Exact test. Likewise, proportions of CD8+ T-cells expressing other functions were significantly higher in 4 of the 7 IFN-γ negative CD8+ T-cells. Notably, newly stimulated Perforin, identified as Perforin co-expression with IL-2 or TNF-α, was significantly higher in IFN-γ negative CD8+ T-cell than in the positive CD8+ T-cells. Using SEB, lower responses in IFN-γ positive cells were most associated with CD4+ than CD8+ T-cells. These findings suggest that studies evaluating immunogenicity in response to HIV and Adenovirus viral antigens should not only evaluate T-cell responsiveness among IFN-γ producing cells but also among those T-cells that do not express IFN-γ.","2019","2019 Jan 03","Ritah Nakiboneka; Susan Mugaba; Betty O Auma; Christopher Kintu; Christina Lindan; Mary Bridget Nanteza; Pontiano Kaleebu; Jennifer Serwanga","Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Uganda Research Unit (MRC/UVRI & LSHTM Uganda Research Unit), Entebbe, Uganda.; Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Uganda Research Unit (MRC/UVRI & LSHTM Uganda Research Unit), Entebbe, Uganda.; Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Uganda Research Unit (MRC/UVRI & LSHTM Uganda Research Unit), Entebbe, Uganda.; Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Uganda Research Unit (MRC/UVRI & LSHTM Uganda Research Unit), Entebbe, Uganda.; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, and Global Health Sciences, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), United States.; Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Uganda Research Unit (MRC/UVRI & LSHTM Uganda Research Unit), Entebbe, Uganda.; Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Uganda Research Unit (MRC/UVRI & LSHTM Uganda Research Unit), Entebbe, Uganda.; Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Uganda Research Unit (MRC/UVRI & LSHTM Uganda Research Unit), Entebbe, Uganda.

HLA alleles B27 and B57 promote the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated depletion of infected cells in ECs, leading to the emergence of escape mutations in the viral capsid (CA). Whether those mutations modulate CA detection by innate sensors and effectors is poorly known. Here, we investigated the targeting of CA from B27/B57+ individuals by cytosolic antiviral factors Mx2 and TRIM5α. Toward that aim, we constructed chimeric HIV-1 vectors using CA isolated from B27/B57+ or control subjects. HIV-1 vectors containing B27/B57+-specific CA had increased sensitivity to TRIM5α but not to Mx2. Following exposure to those vectors, cells showed increased resistance against both TRIM5α-sensitive and -insensitive HIV-1 strains. Induction of the antiviral state did not require productive infection by the TRIM5α-sensitive virus, as shown using chemically inactivated virions. Depletion experiments revealed that TAK1 and Ubc13 were essential to the TRIM5α-dependent antiviral state. Accordingly, induction of the antiviral state was accompanied by the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 in THP-1 cells. Secretion of IFN-I was involved in the antiviral state in THP-1 cells, as shown using a receptor blocking antibody. This work identifies innate activation pathways that are likely to play a role in the natural resistance to HIV-1 progression in ECs.","2018","2018 Nov","Natacha Merindol; Mohamed El-Far; Mohamed Sylla; Nasser Masroori; Caroline Dufour; Jia-Xin Li; Pearl Cherry; Mélodie B Plourde; Cécile Tremblay; Lionel Berthoux","Laboratory of antiviral immunity, Department of medical biology, Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada.; Department of microbiology, infectiology and immunology, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Department of microbiology, infectiology and immunology, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Laboratory of antiviral immunity, Department of medical biology, Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada.; Laboratory of antiviral immunity, Department of medical biology, Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada.; Laboratory of antiviral immunity, Department of medical biology, Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada.; Laboratory of antiviral immunity, Department of medical biology, Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada.; Laboratory of antiviral immunity, Department of medical biology, Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada.; Department of microbiology, infectiology and immunology, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Laboratory of antiviral immunity, Department of medical biology, Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada."

Although HIV infection significantly alters these cells, what drives these perturbations is unclear. Growing evidence suggests that impaired intestinal immune function in HIV leads to chronic immune activation and disease progression. This occurs even in HIV controllers - individuals with undetectable HIV viremia without antiretroviral therapy (ART). We show that Vδ1+ cells, a subset of γδ T cells described as being important in intestinal barrier function, increase in frequency in HIV-infected individuals, including HIV controllers. These cells resemble terminally differentiated effector memory cells, producing the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, TNFα, and MIP-1β upon stimulation. Importantly, pro-inflammatory Vδ1+ cell frequency correlates with levels of HIV RNA in intestinal tissue but not in plasma. This study supports a model in which local viral replication in the gut in HIV controllers disrupts the phenotype and function of Vδ1+ cells, a cell type involved in the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity, and may thereby contribute to systemic immune activation and HIV disease progression.","2018","2018 Nov 07","Gregory S Olson; Sarah W Moore; James M Richter; John J Garber; Brittany A Bowman; Crystal A Rawlings; Meaghan Flagg; Björn Corleis; Douglas S Kwon","The Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; The Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Division of Gastroenterology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Division of Gastroenterology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; The Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; The Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; The Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; The Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; The Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America. dkwon@mgh.harvard.edu."

This discrepancy could potentially be explained by an inability of the immune system to kill HIV-1-infected cells following the reversal of latency. Furthermore, some studies have suggested that certain latency-reversing agents (LRAs) may inhibit CD8+ T cell and natural killer (NK) cell responses. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that alpha interferon (IFN-α) could improve the function of NK cells from chronic progressors (CP) on ART. We show here that IFN-α treatment enhanced cytokine secretion, polyfunctionality, degranulation, and the cytotoxic potential of NK cells from healthy donors (HD) and CP. We also show that this cytokine enhanced the viral suppressive capacity of NK cells from HD and elite controllers or suppressors. Furthermore, IFN-α enhanced global CP CD8+ T cell cytokine responses and the suppressive capacity of ES CD8+ T cells. Our data suggest that IFN-α treatment may potentially be used as an immunomodulatory agent in HIV-1 cure strategies.IMPORTANCE Data suggest that HIV+ individuals unable to control infection fail to do so due to impaired cytokine production and/cytotoxic effector cell function. Consequently, the success of cure agendas such as the shock-and-kill strategy will probably depend on enhancing patient effector cell function. In this regard, NK cells are of particular interest since they complement the function of CD8+ T cells. Here, we demonstrate the ability of short-course alpha interferon (IFN-α) treatments to effectively enhance such effector functions in chronic progressor NK cells without inhibiting their general CD8+ T cell function. These results point to the possibility of exploring such short-course IFN-α treatments for the enhancement of effector cell function in HIV+ patients in future cure strategies.","2019","2019 Feb 01","Abena K R Kwaa; Chloe A G Talana; Joel N Blankson","Center for AIDS Research, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Center for AIDS Research, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Center for AIDS Research, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA jblanks@jhmi.edu."

Conversely, T regulatory (Treg) cells may inhibit antiviral responses or immune activation. In HIV elite controllers, a balanced Th17/Treg ratio is maintained in the blood, suggesting a role for these responses in controlling inflammation and viral replication. HIV-infected individuals exhibit a range in responsiveness to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Given the link between the Th17/Treg ratio and HIV disease, we reasoned these responses may play a role in cART responsiveness. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the mucosal Th17/Treg ratio to acute simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) viremia and the response to cART. Nineteen rhesus macaques were infected with highly pathogenic SIVΔB670 virus and cART was initiated 6 weeks postinfection. Mucosal CD4 T cell subsets were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining in the colon and mesenteric lymph nodes. Higher baseline Th17/Treg ratios corresponded with increased acute SIV viremia. Th17/Treg ratios decreased during acute SIV infection and were not restored during cART, and this corresponded to increased gut immune activation (Ki67+), markers of microbial translocation (sCD14), and T cell exhaustion (TIGIT+). Animals that maintained a more balanced mucosal Th17/Treg ratio at the time of cART initiation exhibited a better virological response to cART and maintained higher peripheral CD4 counts. These results suggest mucosal Th17 and Treg homeostasis influences acute viremia and the response to cART, a result that suggests therapeutic interventions that improve the Th17/Treg ratio before or during cART may improve treatment of HIV.","2019","2019 Mar","Megan A O'Connor; Paul V Munson; Hillary C Tunggal; Nika Hajari; Thomas B Lewis; Debra Bratt; Cassie Moats; Jeremy Smedley; Kenneth C Bagley; James I Mullins; Deborah H Fuller","1 Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.; 2 Washington National Primate Research Center, Seattle, Washington.; 1 Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.; 2 Washington National Primate Research Center, Seattle, Washington.; 1 Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.; 2 Washington National Primate Research Center, Seattle, Washington.; 1 Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.; 2 Washington National Primate Research Center, Seattle, Washington.; 1 Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.; 2 Washington National Primate Research Center, Seattle, Washington.; 2 Washington National Primate Research Center, Seattle, Washington.; 2 Washington National Primate Research Center, Seattle, Washington.; 2 Washington National Primate Research Center, Seattle, Washington.; 3 Profectus Biosciences, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland.; 1 Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.; 1 Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.; 2 Washington National Primate Research Center, Seattle, Washington."

However, it is the opinion of the authors that in developed countries, where first-line ART regimens have minimal toxicities, treatment of elite controllers should be strongly considered. Treatment of elite controllers has the potential to minimize the size of the HIV reservoir, which benefits elite controllers who choose to pursue future cure, dampen immune activation, diminish risk of transmission, and encourage linkage and engagement in care allowing HIV providers the opportunity to address HIV-associated non-AIDS conditions and other co-morbidities. This review aims to summarize literature relevant to the management of elite controllers for clinicians caring for patients living with HIV. Key topics include timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and ART in the unique populations of elite controllers with concomitant cardiovascular disease and hepatitis C co-infection, and undergoing immunosuppressive therapy for other co-morbidities. The persistent HIV reservoir in elite controllers has two main implications. First, increased immune activation appears to adversely impact clinical outcomes in elite controllers, but the role of ART in addressing this effect remains unclear. Second, elite control duration can be limited, but certain factors may help to predict disease progression with implications on timing of ART. Initiation of ART during elite control remains controversial, although there are multiple theoretical benefits. Elite controllers comprise a heterogeneous population of patients living with HIV, and optimal management involves weighing the risk and benefit of ART as well as monitoring of clinical consequences of increased immune activation.","2018","2018 Jun","Katherine Promer; Maile Y Karris","Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, 200 West Arbor Drive #8681, San Diego, CA, 92103, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, 200 West Arbor Drive #8681, San Diego, CA, 92103, USA."

We have characterized the level and phenotype of CD32+ cells contained in different subsets of CD4 T-cells and its potential correlation with level of total HIV-DNA in thirty HIV patients (10 typical progressors naïve for cART, 10 cART-suppressed patients, and 10 elite controllers). Total HIV-DNA was quantified in different subsets of CD4 T-cells: Trm and pTfh cells. Level and immunephenotype of CD32+ cells were analyzed in these same subsets by flow cytometry. CD32 expression in Trm and pTfh subsets was similar in the different groups, and there was no significant correlation between the level of total HIV-DNA and the level of CD32 expression in these subsets. However, total HIV-DNA level was correlated with expression of CD127 (rho = -0.46, p = 0.043) and of CCR6 (rho = -0.418, p = 0.027) on CD32+ cells. Our results do not support CD32 as a biomarker of total HIV-DNA content.

In contrast to adult infection, where elite controllers have been very well characterized and constitute approximately 0.5% of infections, very few data exist to address this question in paediatric infection. We describe 11 ART-naive elite controllers from 10 cohorts of HIV-infected children being followed in South Africa, Brazil, Thailand, and Europe. All but one of the elite controllers (91%) are females. The median age at which control of viraemia was achieved was 6.5 years. Five of these 11 (46%) children lost control of viraemia at a median age of 12.9 years. Children who maintained control of viraemia had significantly higher absolute CD4 cell counts in the period of elite control than those who lost viraemic control. On the basis of data available from these cohorts, the prevalence of elite controllers in paediatric infection is estimated to be 5-10-fold lower than in adults. Although conclusions are limited by the study design, these data suggest that, whilst paediatric elite control can be achieved, compared with adult elite controllers, this occurs rarely, and takes some years after infection to achieve. Also, loss of immune control arises in a high proportion of children and often relatively rapidly. These findings are consistent with the more potent antiviral immune responses observed in adults and in females.","2019","2019 Jan 27","Vinicius A Vieira; Peter Zuidewind; Maximilian Muenchhoff; Julia Roider; Jane Millar; Margaret Clapson; Anriette Van Zyl; Delane Shingadia; Emily Adland; Rohin Athavale; Nicholas Grayson; M Azim Ansari; Christian Brander; Claudia Fortuny Guash; Lars Naver; Thanyawee Puthanakit; Wipaporn Natalie Songtaweesin; Jintanat Ananworanich; Denise Peluso; Beatriz Thomé; Jorge Pinto; Pieter Jooste; Gareth Tudor-Williams; Mark F Cotton; Philip Goulder","Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Max von Pettenkofer-Institute, Department of Virology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich.; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Munich, Germany.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.; Department of Paediatrics, Kimberley Hospital, Kimberley, South Africa.; Department of Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; The Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; IrsiCaixa - AIDS Research Institute, Badalona.; Universitat de Vic-Universitat Central de Catalunya, Vic.; Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats, Barcelona.; Unidad de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Servicio de Pediatría, Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology (CLINTEC), Karolinska Institute, Stockholm.; Department of Pediatrics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; The HIV Netherlands Australia Thailand Research Collaboration.; Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University.; Center of Excellence for Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Vaccines.; Center of Excellence for Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Vaccines.; SEARCH, Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok, Thailand.; US Military HIV Research Program, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring.; Henry M.

The prevalence of this subgroup is estimated to be < 1%. Various cohorts of ECs have been described in developed countries, most of which have been demographically heterogeneous. The aim of this study was to identify ECs in two large African cohorts and to estimate their prevalence in a relatively genetically homogenous population. We screened two cohorts of HIV-positive Ethiopian patients. The first cohort resided in Mekelle, Ethiopia. The second was comprised of HIV-positive Ethiopian immigrants in Israel. In the Mekelle cohort, ART-naïve subjects with stable CD4 counts were prospectively screened using two measurements of viral load 6 months apart. Subjects were defined as ECs when both measurements were undetectable. In the Israeli cohort, subjects with consistently undetectable viral loads (mean of 17 viral load measurements/patient) and stable CD4 count > 500 cells/μL were defined as ECs. In the Mekelle cohort, 16 of 9515 patients (0.16%) fitted the definition of EC, whereas seven of 1160 (0.6%) in the Israeli cohort were identified as ECs (P = 0.011). This is the first large-scale screening for HIV-positive ECs to be performed in entirely African cohorts. The overall prevalence of ECs is within the range of that previously described in developing countries. The significant difference in prevalence between the two cohorts of similar genetic background is probably a consequence of selection bias but warrants further investigation into possible environmental factors which may underlie the EC state.","2019","2019 Jan","Y K Kiros; H Elinav; A Gebreyesus; H Gebremeskel; J Azar; D Chemtob; H Abreha; D Elbirt; E Shahar; M Chowers; D Turner; Z Grossman; A Haile; R E Sutton; S L Maayan; D Wolday","Mekelle University College of Health Sciences, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia.; Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Department, Hadassah University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.; Mekelle University College of Health Sciences, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia.; Mekelle University College of Health Sciences, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia.; Internal Medicine Division, Hadassah University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.; Department of Tuberculosis and AIDS, Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel.; Mekelle University College of Health Sciences, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia.; The Allergy, Clinical Immunology and AIDS Unit, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.; Institute of Allergy, Immunology and AIDS Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.; Infectious Diseases Unit, Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba, Israel.; Crusaid Kobler AIDS Center, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel.; Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Department, Hadassah University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.; Mekelle University College of Health Sciences, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Barzilai Medical Center, Ashkelon, Israel.; Mekelle University College of Health Sciences, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia."

Comparative plasma shotgun proteomics was performed with tandem mass tag (TMT) isobaric tag labeling and nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Eighteen proteins exhibited differences comparing PC and preloss TC timepoints. These proteins were involved in proinflammatory mechanisms, and some of them play a role in HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis and interact with structural viral proteins. Coagulation factor XI, α-1-antichymotrypsin, ficolin-2, 14-3-3 protein, and galectin-3-binding protein were considered potential biomarkers.

Understanding the complex immunologic and virologic characteristics of these specific patients holds promise for inducing drug-free control of HIV-1 in broader populations of HIV-1 infected patients. We used an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to characterize CD8+ T cells, the strongest correlate of HIV-1 immune control identified thus far, in a large cohort of elite controllers (n = 51); highly active antiretrovial therapy (HAART)-treated patients (n = 32) and HIV-1 negative (n = 10) served as reference cohorts. We isolated mRNA from total CD8+ T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of each individual followed by microarray analysis of the transcriptional signatures. We observed profound transcriptional differences [590 transcripts, false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P < 0.05] between elite controller and HAART-treated patients. Interestingly, metabolic and signalling pathways governed by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and eIF2, known for their key roles in regulating cellular growth, proliferation and metabolism, were among the top functions enriched in the differentially expressed genes, suggesting a therapeutically actionable target as a distinguishing feature of spontaneous HIV-1 immune control. A subsequent bootstrapping approach distinguished five different subgroups of elite controller, each characterized by distinct transcriptional signatures. However, despite this marked heterogeneity, differential regulation of mTOR and eIF2 signalling remained the dominant functional pathway in three of these elite controller subgroups. These studies suggest that mTOR and eIF2 signalling may play a remarkably universal role for regulating CD8 T-cell function from elite controllers.","2018","2018 Nov 28","Fatema Z Chowdhury; Zhengyu Ouyang; Maria Buzon; Bruce D Walker; Mathias Lichterfeld; Xu G Yu","Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."

Thus, evaluating the dynamics of the emergence of CTL-escape mutants in HICs reservoirs is important for understanding viremia control. To analyze the HIV-1 mutational profile and dynamics of CTL-escape mutants in HICs, we selected 11 long-term non-progressor individuals and divided them into the following groups: (1) viremic controllers (VCs; n = 5) and (2) elite controllers (ECs; n = 6). For each individual, we used HIV-1 proviral DNA from PBMCs related to earliest (VE) and latest (VL) visits to obtain gag and nef sequences using the Illumina HiSeq system. The consensus of each mapped gene was used to assess viral divergence, and next-generation sequencing data were employed to identify SNPs and variations within and flanking CTL epitopes. Divergence analysis showed higher values for nef compared to gag among the HICs. EC and VC groups showed similar divergence rates for both genes. Analysis of the number of SNPs showed that VCs present more variability in both genes. Synonymous/non-synonymous mutation ratios were < 1 for gag among ECs and for nef among ECs and VCs, exhibiting a predominance of non-synonymous mutations. Such mutations were observed in regions encoding CTL-restricted epitopes in all individuals. All ECs presented non-synonymous mutations in CTL epitopes but generally at low frequency (< 1%); all VCs showed a high number of mutations, with significant frequency changes between VE and VL visits. A higher frequency of internal mutations was observed for gag epitopes, with significant changes across visits compared to Nef epitopes, indicating a pattern associated with differential genetic pressure. The high genetic conservation of HIV-1 gag and nef among ECs indicates that the higher level of viremia control restricts the evolution of both genes. Although viral replication levels in HICs are low or undetectable, all individuals exhibited CTL epitope mutations in proviral gag and nef variants, indicating that potential CTL escape mutants are present in HIC reservoirs and that situations leading to a disequilibrium of the host-virus relationship can result in the spread of CTL-escape variants.","2018","2018 Sep 10","Diogo Gama Caetano; Fernanda Heloise Côrtes; Gonzalo Bello; Sylvia Lopes Maia Teixeira; Brenda Hoagland; Beatriz Grinsztejn; Valdilea Gonçalves Veloso; Monick Lindenmeyer Guimarães; Mariza Gonçalves Morgado","Laboratório de Aids e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz -FIOCRUZ, Av.

We created SIVΔnef-8x to test the hypothesis that effective SIV-specific T cell responses targeting invariant viral regions can emerge in the absence of immunodominant CD8+ T cell responses targeting variable epitopes and that control is achievable in individuals lacking known ""protective"" MHC alleles. Full-proteome gamma interferon (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays identified six newly targeted immunogenic regions following SIVΔnef-8x infection of M3/M3 MCMs. We deep sequenced circulating virus and found that four of the six newly targeted regions rarely accumulated mutations. Six animals infected with SIVΔnef-8x had T cell responses that targeted at least one of the four invariant regions and had a lower set point viral load than two animals that did not have T cell responses that targeted any invariant regions. We found that MHC class II molecules restricted all four of the invariant peptide regions, while the two variable regions were restricted by MHC class I molecules. Therefore, in the absence of immunodominant CD8+ T cell responses that target variable regions during SIVmac239Δnef infection, individuals without protective MHC alleles developed predominantly CD4+ T cell responses specific for invariant regions that may improve control of virus replication. Our results provide some evidence that antiviral CD4+ T cells during acute SIV infection can contribute to effective viral control and should be considered in strategies to combat HIV infection.IMPORTANCE Studies defining effective cellular immune responses to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and SIV have largely focused on a rare population that express specific MHC class I alleles and control virus replication in the absence of antiretroviral treatment. This leaves in question whether similar effective immune responses can be achieved in the larger population. The majority of HIV-infected individuals mount CD8+ T cell responses that target variable viral regions that accumulate high-frequency escape mutations. Limiting T cell responses to these variable regions and targeting invariant viral regions, similar to observations in rare ""elite controllers,"" may provide an ideal strategy for the development of effective T cell responses in individuals with diverse MHC genetics. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to determine whether T cell responses can be redirected toward invariant viral regions in individuals without protective MHC alleles and if these responses improve control of virus replication.","2018","2018 Nov 01","Matthew S Sutton; Amy Ellis-Connell; Ryan V Moriarty; Alexis J Balgeman; Dane Gellerup; Gabrielle Barry; Andrea M Weiler; Thomas C Friedrich; Shelby L O'Connor","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Pathobiological Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA slfeinberg@wisc.edu.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA."

With recent improvements in viral load (VL) detection methods to levels as low as 20 copies per milliliter, 2 subsets of LTNPs have been defined: elite controllers (ECs), with undetectable VLs for at least 6-12 months, and viremic controllers (VCs), with VLs between 200 and 2000 copies per milliliter. ECs and VCs have been extensively studied in the developed world to determine underlying mechanisms responsible for virologic control. In sub-Saharan Africa, most studies have characterized LTNPs based on immunologic criteria making it difficult to compare findings with the Western cohorts, which use virologic criteria. Here, we describe a cohort of Uganda ECs and VCs attending a large HIV ambulatory center in Kampala, Uganda, based initially on CD4 counts and confirmed by repeated VL measurements. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 14,492 HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naive individuals aged 18 years and older under care for at least 5 years with serial peripheral CD4 counts ≥500 cells/μL. Among those, we determined the frequency of individuals with VLs <2000 copies per milliliter for at least 6 months. We report a prevalence of 0.26% (38/14,492) of HIV controllers in the clinic. We identified 36 ECs and 2 VCs. These individuals were middle-aged with an average CD4 count of 858 ± 172 (mean ± SD, 95% confidence interval: 795 to 921). Their average duration in HIV care was 7.4 ± 2.1 years (mean ± SD, 95% confidence interval: 6.6 to 8.1). The majority of EC/VCs were women (87%, 33/38), reflecting the demographics of the urban clinic. For the first time, this study demonstrates the frequency of EC/VCs in a large urban clinic in Uganda. Further study of these East African subjects may provide insights into how some individuals are able to control HIV in the absence of medications.","2018","2018 Nov 01","Alex Kayongo; Elena Gonzalo-Gil; Emrah Gümüşgöz; Anxious J Niwaha; Fred Semitala; Robert Kalyesubula; Bernard S Bagaya; Moses L Joloba; Richard E Sutton","Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.; Makerere University Joint AIDS Program, Kampala, Uganda.; Makerere University Joint AIDS Program, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Internal Medicine, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Internal Medicine, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT."

The mechanisms contributing to this control remain incompletely elucidated. In the present study, we have assessed whether cellular host factors could modulate HIV-1 replication post-entry in a controller-discordant couple living with HIV-1. CD4 T cells from a controller-discordant couple, one partner being an EC and the other an HIV-1 progressor (PR), and healthy controls (HC) were isolated, activated and infected with VSV-G pseudotyped yellow fluorescent protein-encoding single-round HIV-1 virus (HIV-YFP). Viral reverse transcripts, 2-LTR circles and integrated proviral HIV-1 DNA were monitored by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and integration sites were analysed. We further measured LEDGF/p75 and p21 mRNA expression levels by qPCR. Infection of activated CD4 T cells with HIV-YFP was reduced in EC compared with the PR partner, and HC. Evaluation of viral DNA forms suggested a block after entry and during the early steps of HIV-1 reverse transcription in EC. The integration site distribution pattern in EC, PR and HC was similar. The p21 expression in CD4 T cells of EC was elevated compared with the PR or HC, in line with previous work. Our study suggests a reduced permissiveness to HIV-1 infection of CD4 T cells from EC due to a block of HIV-1 replication after entry and before integration that might contribute to the EC phenotype in our patient.","2018","2018 Jul 01","Paradise Madlala; Paulien Van de Velde; Barbara Van Remoortel; Sofie Vets; Eric Van Wijngaerden; Kristel Van Laethem; Rik Gijsbers; Rik Schrijvers; Zeger Debyser","HIV Pathogenesis Program, Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.; Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Belgium.; Laboratory for Clinical Infectious and Inflammatory Disorders, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KU Leuven, Belgium.; Laboratory of Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KU Leuven, Belgium.; Laboratory of Clinical Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KU Leuven, Belgium.; Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Belgium.; Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Belgium.; Laboratory for Clinical Infectious and Inflammatory Disorders, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KU Leuven, Belgium.; Laboratory of Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KU Leuven, Belgium.; Laboratory of Clinical Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KU Leuven, Belgium.; Laboratory of Clinical Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KU Leuven, Belgium.; Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Belgium."

It is unclear, however, whether ECs might be considered a natural model of a functional cure because some studies have noted CD4+ T cell depletion and disease progression associated with abnormally high levels of immune activation and/or inflammation in this group. Here, we propose the use of immunological parameters to identify HIV-1 ECs that could represent the best model of a functional cure. We compared plasma levels of six inflammatory biomarkers (IP-10, IL-18, sCD163, sCD14, CRP, and IL-6) and percentages of activated CD8+ T cells (CD38+HLA-DR+) between 15 ECs [8 with persistent undetectable viremia (persistent elite controllers) and 7 with occasional viral blips (ebbing elite controllers)], 13 viremic controllers (VCs-plasma VL between 51 and 2,000 RNA copies/mL), and 18 HIV-1 infected patients in combined antiretroviral therapy, with suppressed viremia, and 18 HIV-uninfected controls (HIV-neg). The two groups of ECs presented inflammation and activation profiles similar to HIV-neg individuals, and there was no evidence of CD4+ T cell decline over time. VCs, by contrast, had higher levels of IL-18, IP-10, and CRP and a lower CD4/CD8 ratio than that of HIV-neg (P < 0.05). Plasma levels of IL-18 and IP-10 correlated positively with CD8+ T cell activation and negatively with both CD4/CD8 and CD4% in HIV-1 controllers. These results suggest that most ECs, defined using stringent criteria in relation to the cutoff level of viremia (≤50 copies/mL) and a minimum follow-up time of >5 years, show no evidence of persistent inflammation or immune activation. This study further suggests that plasmatic levels of IL-18/IP-10 combined with the frequency of CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells can be important biomarkers to identify models of a functional cure among HIV-1 ECs.","2018","2018","Fernanda H Côrtes; Hury H S de Paula; Gonzalo Bello; Marcelo Ribeiro-Alves; Suwellen S D de Azevedo; Diogo G Caetano; Sylvia L M Teixeira; Brenda Hoagland; Beatriz Grinsztejn; Valdilea G Veloso; Monick L Guimarães; Mariza G Morgado","Laboratório de Aids e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Aids e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Aids e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST/Aids, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Aids e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Aids e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Aids e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST/Aids, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST/Aids, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST/Aids, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Aids e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Aids e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."

We carried out a retrospective study in 30 HIV-ECs classified into two groups: those showing no significant loss of CD4+ T-cells during the observation period (stable CD4+, n = 19) and those showing a significant decrease of CD4+ T-cells (decline CD4+, n = 11). Baseline plasma biomarkers were measured using a multiplex immunoassay: sTNF-R1, TRAIL, sFas (APO), sFasL, TNF-α, TNF-β, IL-8, IL-18, IL-6, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, SDF1α, GRO-α, and CCL11. Baseline levels of sTNF-R1 and CCL11 and sTNF-R1/TNF-α ratio correlated with the slope of CD4+ T-cells (cells/μl/year) during follow-up [r = -0.370 (p = 0.043), r = -0.314 (p = 0.091), and r = -0.381 (p = 0.038); respectively]. HIV-ECs with declining CD4+ T-cells had higher baseline plasma levels of sTNF-R1 [1,500.7 (555.7; 2,060.7) pg/ml vs. 450.8 (227.9; 1,263.9) pg/ml; p = 0.018] and CCL11 [29.8 (23.5; 54.9) vs. 19.2 (17.8; 29.9) pg/ml; p = 0.041], and sTNF-R1/TNF-α ratio [84.7 (33.2; 124.2) vs. 25.9 (16.3; 75.1); p = 0.012] than HIV-1 ECs with stable CD4+ T-cells.

The cut-off of 75th percentile (high values) for these biomarkers had 71.4% positive predictive value and 73.9% negative predictive value for anticipating the evolution of CD4+ T-cells. In conclusion, the loss of CD4+ T-cells in HIV-ECs was associated with higher levels of two plasma inflammatory biomarkers (sTNF-R1 and CCL11), which were also reasonably accurate for the prediction of the CD4+ T-cells loss.","2018","2018","Mónica Gutiérrez-Rivas; María Ángeles Jiménez-Sousa; Norma Rallón; José Luis Jiménez; Clara Restrepo; Agathe León; Marta Montero-Alonso; Juan González-García; María Ángeles Muñoz-Fernández; José Miguel Benito; Salvador Resino; ","Unidad de Infección Viral e Inmunidad, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Spain.; Unidad de Infección Viral e Inmunidad, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Spain.; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; Plataforma de Laboratorio, Hospital General Universitario ""Gregorio Marañón"", Madrid, Spain.; Sección Inmunología, Laboratory InmunoBiología Molecular, Hospital General Universitario ""Gregorio Marañón"", Madrid, Spain.; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; Servicio de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.; Unidad de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Hospital Universitario y Politécnico ""La Fe"", Valencia, Spain.; Servicio de Medicina Interna, Hospital Universitario ""La Paz"", Madrid, Spain.; Sección Inmunología, Laboratory InmunoBiología Molecular, Hospital General Universitario ""Gregorio Marañón"", Madrid, Spain.; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria del Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain.; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; Unidad de Infección Viral e Inmunidad, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Spain."

Through extensive comparison of blood, thoracic duct lymph (TDL), and LTs in different species, we show that many LT memory CD8+ T cells bear phenotypic, transcriptional, and epigenetic signatures of resident memory T cells (TRMs). Unlike their circulating counterparts in blood or TDL, most of the total and follicular HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in LTs also resemble TRMs Moreover, high frequencies of HIV-specific CD8+ TRMs with skewed clonotypic profiles relative to matched blood samples are present in LTs of individuals who spontaneously control HIV replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (elite controllers). Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis confirmed that HIV-specific TRMs are enriched for effector-related immune genes and signatures compared with HIV-specific non-TRMs in elite controllers. Together, these data indicate that previous studies in blood have largely failed to capture the major component of HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses resident within LTs.","2018","2018 Jun 01","Marcus Buggert;

Several studies have specifically suggested that circulating effector CD4+ T cells may play a direct role in control of HIV replication through cytolytic activity or autocrine β-chemokine production. However, it remains unclear whether effector CD4+ T cells expressing cytolytic molecules and β-chemokines are present within lymph nodes (LNs), a major site of HIV replication. Here, we report that expression of β-chemokines and cytolytic molecules are enriched within a CD4+ T cell population with high levels of the T-box transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin (Eomes). This effector population is predominately found in peripheral blood and is limited in LNs regardless of HIV infection or treatment status. As a result, CD4+ T cells generally lack effector functions in LNs, including cytolytic capacity and IFNγ and β-chemokine expression, even in HIV elite controllers and during acute/early HIV infection. While we do find the presence of degranulating CD4+ T cells in LNs, these cells do not bear functional or transcriptional effector T cell properties and are inherently poor to form stable immunological synapses compared to their peripheral blood counterparts. We demonstrate that CD4+ T cell cytolytic function, phenotype, and programming in the peripheral blood is dissociated from those characteristics found in lymphoid tissues. Together, these data challenge our current models based on blood and suggest spatially and temporally dissociated mechanisms of viral control in lymphoid tissues.","2018","2018 Apr","Marcus Buggert; Son Nguyen; Laura M McLane; Maria Steblyanko; Nadia Anikeeva; Dominic Paquin-Proulx; Perla M Del Rio Estrada; Yuria Ablanedo-Terrazas; Kajsa Noyan; Morgan A Reuter; Korey Demers; Johan K Sandberg; Michael A Eller; Hendrik Streeck; Marianne Jansson; Piotr Nowak; Anders Sönnerborg; David H Canaday; Ali Naji; E John Wherry; Merlin L Robb; Steven G Deeks; Gustavo Reyes-Teran; Yuri Sykulev; Annika C Karlsson; Michael R Betts","Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.; Institute for Immunology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.; Center for Infection Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.; Institute for Immunology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.; Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.; Institute for Immunology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.; Microbiology and Immunology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.; Microbiology and Immunology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.; Center for Infection Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.; U.S. Military HIV Research Program, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, United States of America.; Henry M.

This control is the result of a complex interaction of host, immune, and viral factors. We identified, by phylogenetic analysis, a cluster of LTNP-ECs infected with very similar low-replication HIV-1 viruses, suggesting the contribution of common viral features to the clinical LTNP-EC phenotype. HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein mediates signaling and promotes HIV-1 fusion, entry, and infection, being a key factor of viral fitness in vitro, cytopathicity, and infection progression in vivo Therefore, we isolated full-length env genes from viruses of these patients and from chronically infected control individuals. Functional characterization of the initial events of the viral infection showed that Envs from the LTNP-ECs were ineffective in the binding to CD4 and in the key triggering of actin/tubulin-cytoskeleton modifications compared to Envs from chronic patients. The viral properties of the cluster viruses result in a defective viral fusion, entry, and infection, and these properties were inherited by every virus of the cluster. Therefore, inefficient HIV-1 Env functions and signaling defects may contribute to the low viral replication capacity and transmissibility of the cluster viruses, suggesting a direct role in the LTNP-EC phenotype of these individuals. These results highlight the important role of viral characteristics in the LTNP-EC clinical phenotype. These Env viral properties were common to all the cluster viruses and thus support the heritability of the viral characteristics.IMPORTANCE HIV-1 long-term nonprogressor elite controller patients, due to their permanent control of viral replication, have been the object of numerous studies to identify the factors responsible for this clinical phenotype. In this work, we analyzed the viral characteristics of the envelopes of viruses from a phylogenetic cluster of LTNP-EC patients. These envelopes showed ineffective binding to CD4 and the subsequent signaling activity to modify actin/tubulin cytoskeletons, which result in low fusion and deficient entry and infection capacities. These Env viral characteristics could explain the nonprogressor clinical phenotype of these patients. In addition, these inefficient env viral properties were present in all viruses of the cluster, supporting the heritability of the viral phenotype.","2018","2018 Apr 10","Concepción Casado; Sara Marrero-Hernández; Daniel Márquez-Arce; María Pernas; Sílvia Marfil; Ferran Borràs-Grañana; Isabel Olivares; Romina Cabrera-Rodríguez; María-Soledad Valera; Laura de Armas-Rillo; Philippe Lemey; Julià Blanco; Agustín Valenzuela-Fernández; Cecilio Lopez-Galíndez","Unidad de Virologia Molecular, Laboratorio de Referencia e Investigación en Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiología (CNM), Instituto de Salud Carlos IIII, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Unidad de Virología IUETSPC, Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), Tenerife, Spain.; Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Unidad de Virología IUETSPC, Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), Tenerife, Spain.; Unidad de Virologia Molecular, Laboratorio de Referencia e Investigación en Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiología (CNM), Instituto de Salud Carlos IIII, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; Institut de Recerca de la Sida IrsiCaixa, Institut d'Investigació en Ciències de la Salut Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.; Institut de Recerca de la Sida IrsiCaixa, Institut d'Investigació en Ciències de la Salut Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.; Unidad de Virologia Molecular, Laboratorio de Referencia e Investigación en Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiología (CNM), Instituto de Salud Carlos IIII, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Unidad de Virología IUETSPC, Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), Tenerife, Spain.; Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Unidad de Virología IUETSPC, Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), Tenerife, Spain.; Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Unidad de Virología IUETSPC, Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), Tenerife, Spain.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, KU Leuven, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Institut de Recerca de la Sida IrsiCaixa, Institut d'Investigació en Ciències de la Salut Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.; Universitat de Vic, Universitat Central de Catalunya, UVIC, Vic, Spain.; Laboratorio de Inmunología Celular y Viral, Unidad de Virología IUETSPC, Unidad de Farmacología, Sección de Medicina, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de La Laguna (ULL), Tenerife, Spain avalenzu@ull.edu.es clopez@isciii.es.; Unidad de Virologia Molecular, Laboratorio de Referencia e Investigación en Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiología (CNM), Instituto de Salud Carlos IIII, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain avalenzu@ull.edu.es clopez@isciii.es."

The specific factors associated with this atypical control of the HIV infection have been poorly described. Since specific T cell responses seem to be one of the main causes of HIV-1 control in elite controllers, we studied whether HIV-1 Gag-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses could also modulate disease control in VNPs. We characterized the immune responses from four VNPs compared to those of five standard progressors (SPs) during the first years of HIV-1 infection. We observed no differences in the breadth and frequency of Gag-specific cellular responses. Furthermore, we obtained 217 HIV-1Gag clonal sequences in which the viral variability of Gag increased over 3 years of infection for synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations in both VNPs and SPs. VNPs evolution rates in gag were comparable to SPs. This observation is in line with a similar accumulation of CTL putative escape mutations in Gag epitopes targeted by CTL responses. Altogether, the absence of viral pathogenesis in VNP individuals seems to be independent of HIV-Gag-specific CTL responses. This novel information guides to the study of alternative mechanism of HIV-1 pathogenesis control.IMPORTANCE Control of HIV infection has been widely studied in elite controllers or long-term nonprogressor models. However, there is a less-known group of individuals, termed viremic nonprogressors (VNPs), who maintain stable CD4+ T cell counts despite high plasma viremia. The mechanisms involved in this remarkable control of HIV-1 pathogenesis clearly have implications for the development of new drugs and vaccines. We show here for the first time that VNPs have immune responses and HIV-gag evolution similar to those of standard progressors. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the mechanism of pathogenesis control in these individuals differs from some elite controllers that are reported to have improved immune control. This is noteworthy since it opens the door to new, as-yet-unknown mechanisms for HIV control. Our novel results advance the understanding of mechanisms involved in viremic nonprogression and suggest that there are alternative mechanisms to the adaptive immune responses for an effective control of viral pathogenesis.","2018","2018 Jun 15","Maria Salgado; Albert Garcia-Minambres; Judith Dalmau; Esther Jiménez-Moyano; Pompeyo Viciana; Belén Alejos; Bonaventura Clotet; Julia G Prado; Javier Martinez-Picado","irsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Badalona, Spain msalgado@irsicaixa.es jmpicado@irsicaixa.es.; irsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.; irsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.; irsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.; Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Seville, Spain.; Centro Nacional de Epidemiología-ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.; irsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.; University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia (UVic-UCC), Vic, Spain.; irsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.; irsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Badalona, Spain msalgado@irsicaixa.es jmpicado@irsicaixa.es.; Centro Nacional de Epidemiología-ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.; Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain."

It has been described that rare aviremic HIV-1-infected patients can generate bNAbs but this issue remains controversial. To address this matter we have assessed bNAb responses in a large cohort of long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) with low or undetectable viremia. Samples from the LTNP cohort of the Spanish AIDS Research Network (87 elite and 42 viremic controllers) and a control population of 176 viremic typical-progressors (TPs) were screened for bNAbs using Env-recombinant viruses. bNAb specificities were studied by ELISA using mutated gp120, neutralization assays with mutated viruses, and peptide competition. Epitope specificities were also elucidated from the serum pattern of neutralization against a panel of diverse HIV-1 isolates. Broadly neutralizing sera were found among 9.3% LTNPs, both elite (7%) and viremic controllers (14%). Within the broadly neutralizing sera, CD4 binding site antibodies were detected by ELISA in 4/12 LTNPs (33%), and 16/33 of TPs (48%). Anti-MPER antibodies were detected in 6/12 LTNPs (50%) and 14/33 TPs (42%) whereas glycan-dependent HIV-1 bNAbs were more frequent in LTNPs (11/12, 92%) as compared to TPs (12/33, 36%). A good concordance between standard serum mapping and neutralization-based mapping was observed. LTNPs, both viremic and elite controllers, showed broad humoral immune responses against HIV-1, including activity against many major epitopes involved in bNAbs-mediated protection.","2018","2018","Nuria González; Krisha McKee; Rebecca M Lynch; Ivelin S Georgiev; Laura Jimenez; Eulalia Grau; Eloísa Yuste; Peter D Kwong; John R Mascola; José Alcamí","AIDS Immunopathology Unit, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, Washington, United States of America.; Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, Washington, United States of America.; Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, Washington, United States of America.; AIDS Immunopathology Unit, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; IrsiCaixa Foundation, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.; Retrovirology and Viral Immunopathology Laboratory, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clínic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, Washington, United States of America.; Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, Washington, United States of America.; AIDS Immunopathology Unit, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain."

Discovering perturbations in immunological parameters could help our understanding of the mechanisms that may be operating in those patients experiencing loss of immunological control. A case-control study was performed to evaluate if alterations in different T-cell homeostatic parameters can predict CD4 T-cell loss in ECs by comparing data from EC patients showing significant CD4 decline (cases) and EC patients showing stable CD4 counts (controls). The partial least-squares-class modeling (PLS-CM) statistical methodology was employed to discriminate between the two groups of patients, and as a predictive model. Herein, we show that among T-cell homeostatic alterations, lower levels of naïve and recent thymic emigrant subsets of CD8 cells and higher levels of effector and senescent subsets of CD8 cells as well as higher levels of exhaustion of CD4 cells, measured prior to CD4 T-cell loss, predict the loss of immunological control. These data indicate that the parameters of T-cell homeostasis may identify those EC patients with a higher proclivity to CD4 T-cell loss. Our results may open new avenues for understanding the mechanisms underlying immunological progression despite HIV replication control, and eventually, for finding a functional cure through immune-based clinical trials.","2018","2018 Feb 28","José M Benito; María C Ortiz; Agathe León; Luis A Sarabia; José M Ligos; María Montoya; Marcial Garcia; Ezequiel Ruiz-Mateos; Rosario Palacios; Alfonso Cabello; Clara Restrepo; Carmen Rodriguez; Jorge Del Romero; Manuel Leal; María A Muñoz-Fernández; José Alcamí; Felipe García; Miguel Górgolas; Norma Rallón; ","IIS-Fundación Jiménez Díaz, UAM, Av.

It is well established that expression of multiple inhibitory receptors on CD8+ T cells is associated with HIV-1 disease progression. However, whether reduced co-expression of inhibitory receptors on CD4+ T cells is linked to natural viral control and slow HIV-1 disease progression remains undefined. Here, we report on the expression pattern of numerous measurable inhibitory receptors, associated with T cell exhaustion (programmed cell death-1, CTLA-4, and TIGIT), on different CD4+ T cell memory populations in ELCs and HIV-infected subjects with or without long-term cART. We found that the co-expression pattern of inhibitory receptors was significantly reduced in ELCs compared with HIV-1 cART-treated and viremic subjects, and similar to healthy controls. Markers associated with T cell exhaustion varied among different memory CD4+ T cell subsets and highest levels were found mainly on transitional memory T cells. CD4+ T cells co-expressing all inhibitory markers were positively correlated to T cell activation (CD38+ HLA-DR+) as well as the transcription factors Helios and FoxP3. Finally, clinical parameters such as CD4 count, HIV-1 viral load, and the CD4/CD8 ratio all showed significant associations with CD4+ T cell exhaustion. We demonstrate that ELCs are able to maintain lower levels of CD4+ T cell exhaustion despite years of ongoing viral replication compared with successfully cART-treated subjects. Our findings suggest that ELCs harbor a ""healthy"" state of inhibitory receptor expression on CD4+ T cells that might play part in maintenance of their control status.","2018","2018","Kajsa Noyan; Son Nguyen; Michael R Betts; Anders Sönnerborg; Marcus Buggert","Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."

Inter-individual variations in cellular composition and communication could thus potentially alter host protection. Here, we explore this hypothesis by applying single-cell RNA-sequencing to examine viral responses among the dendritic cells (DCs) of three elite controllers (ECs) of HIV-1 infection. To overcome the potentially confounding effects of donor-to-donor variability, we present a generally applicable computational framework for identifying reproducible patterns in gene expression across donors who share a unifying classification. Applying it, we discover a highly functional antiviral DC state in ECs whose fractional abundance after in vitro exposure to HIV-1 correlates with higher CD4+ T cell counts and lower HIV-1 viral loads, and that effectively primes polyfunctional T cell responses in vitro. By integrating information from existing genomic databases into our reproducibility-based analysis, we identify and validate select immunomodulators that increase the fractional abundance of this state in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals in vitro. Overall, our results demonstrate how single-cell approaches can reveal previously unappreciated, yet important, immune behaviors and empower rational frameworks for modulating systems-level immune responses that may prove therapeutically and prophylactically useful.","2018","2018 Jan 29","Enrique Martin-Gayo; Michael B Cole; Kellie E Kolb; Zhengyu Ouyang; Jacqueline Cronin; Samuel W Kazer; Jose Ordovas-Montanes; Mathias Lichterfeld; Bruce D Walker; Nir Yosef; Alex K Shalek; Xu G Yu","Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Institute for Medical Engineering & Science (IMES) and Department of Chemistry, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Institute for Medical Engineering & Science (IMES) and Department of Chemistry, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Institute for Medical Engineering & Science (IMES) and Department of Chemistry, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA. niryosef@berkeley.edu.; Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. niryosef@berkeley.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA. niryosef@berkeley.edu.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA. shalek@mit.edu.; Institute for Medical Engineering & Science (IMES) and Department of Chemistry, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA. shalek@mit.edu.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA. shalek@mit.edu.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA. xyu@mgh.harvard.edu.; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. xyu@mgh.harvard.edu."

Understanding what mediates viral control in these individuals has provided us with insights into the immune mechanisms that may be important to induce for a vaccine or functional cure for HIV. To date, few African elite controllers from high incidence settings have been described. We identified virological controllers from the CAPRISA 002 cohort of HIV-1 subtype C infected women in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, two (1%) of whom were elite controllers. We examined the genetic, clinical, immunological and virological characteristics of these two elite HIV controllers in detail, to determine whether they exhibit features of putative viral control similar to those described for elite controllers reported in the literature. In this case report, we present clinical features, CD4+ T cell and viral load trajectories for two African women over 7 years of HIV infection. Viral load became undetectable 10 months after HIV infection in Elite Controller 1 (EC1), and after 6 weeks in Elite Controller 2 (EC2), and remained undetectable for the duration of follow-up, in the absence of ART. Both elite controllers expressed multiple HLA Class I and II haplotypes previously associated with slower disease progression (HLA-A*74:01, HLA-B*44:03, HLA-B*81:01, HLA-B*57:03, HLA-DRB1*13). Fitness assays revealed that both women were infected with replication competent viruses, and both expressed higher mRNA levels of p21, a host restriction factor associated with viral control. HIV-specific T cell responses were examined using flow cytometry. EC1 mounted high frequency HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, including a B*81:01-restricted Gag TL9 response. Unusually, EC2 had evidence of pre-infection HIV-specific CD4+ T cell responses. We identified some features typical of elite controllers, including high magnitude HIV-specific responses and beneficial HLA. In addition, we made the atypical finding of pre-infection HIV-specific immunity in one elite controller, that may have contributed to very early viral control. This report highlights the importance of studying HIV controllers in high incidence settings.","2018","2018 Jan 25","Yumna Moosa; Ramla F Tanko; Veron Ramsuran; Ravesh Singh; Mashudu Madzivhandila; Nonhlanhla Yende-Zuma; Melissa-Rose Abrahams; Philippe Selhorst; Kamini Gounder; Penny L Moore; Carolyn Williamson; Salim S Abdool Karim; Nigel J Garrett; Wendy A Burgers","Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.; Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.; Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.; School of Laboratory Medicine and Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.; Cancer Inflammation Program, Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Leidos-Frederick, Incorporated, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, USA.; Department of Microbiology, National Health Laboratory Services, KZN Academic Complex, Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital, Durban, South Africa.; Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa.; Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.; Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.; Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.; HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, Nelson R.

So far, there is no information on the role played by A3H in spontaneous control of HIV. The aim of this study was to evaluate the A3H polymorphisms distribution in a well-characterized group of Elite Controller (EC) subjects. Methods We analyzed the genotype distribution of two different SNPs (rs139297 and rs79323350) of A3H in 30 EC patients and compared with 11 non-controller (NC) HIV patients. Genotyping was performed by PCR, cloning and Sanger sequencing. Both polymorphisms were analyzed jointly in order to adequately attribute the active or inactive status of A3H protein. Results EC subjects included in this study were able to maintain a long-term sustained spontaneous HIV-viral control and optimal CD4-T-cell counts; however, haplotypes leading to an active protein were very poorly represented in these patients. We found that the majority of EC subjects (23/30; 77%) presented allelic combinations leading to an inactive A3H protein, a frequency slightly lower than that observed for NC studied patients (10/11; 91%). Conclusions The high prevalence of non-functional protein coding-genotypes in EC subjects seems to indicate that other innate restriction factors different from APOBEC3H could be implicated in the replication control exhibited by these subjects.","2018","2018","José M Benito; Julia Hillung; Clara Restrepo; José M Cuevas; Agathe León; Ezequiel Ruiz-Mateos; Rosario Palacios-Muñoz; Miguel Górgolas; Rafael Sanjuán; Norma Rallón","Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria-Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; Institute for Integrative Systems Biology (I2SysBio), Universitat de València and Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, València, Spain.; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria-Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Spain.; Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; Institute for Integrative Systems Biology (I2SysBio), Universitat de València and Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, València, Spain.; Departament de Genètica, Universitat de València, València, Spain.; Hospital Clínic of Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.; Biomedicine Institute of Seville (IBiS), Sevilla, Spain.; Unidad de E.

However, these subjects have heterogeneous clinical outcomes, including a proportion that loses HIV-1 control over time. In this work, we compared, in a longitudinal design, transient EC, analyzed before and after the loss of virological control, with persistent EC. The aim was to identify factors leading to the loss of natural virological control of HIV-1 infection with a longitudinal retrospective study design. Gag-specific T-cell responses were assessed by in vitro intracellular polycytokine production quantified by flow cytometry. Viral diversity determinations and sequence dating were performed in proviral DNA by PCR amplification at limiting dilution of env and gag genes. The expression profile of 70 serum cytokines and chemokines was assessed by multiplex immunoassays. We identified transient EC as subjects with low Gag-specific T-cell polyfunctionality, high viral diversity, and high proinflammatory cytokine levels before the loss of control. Gag-specific T-cell polyfunctionality was inversely associated with viral diversity in transient controllers before the loss of control (r = -0.8; P = 0.02). RANTES was a potential biomarker of transient control. This study identified virological and immunological factors, including inflammatory biomarkers associated with two different phenotypes within EC. These results may allow a more accurate definition of EC, which could help in better clinical management of these individuals and in the development of future curative approaches.IMPORTANCE There is a rare group of HIV-infected patients who have the extraordinary capacity to maintain undetectable viral load levels in the absence of antiretroviral treatment, the so-called HIV-1 elite controllers (EC). However, there is a proportion within these subjects that eventually loses this capability. In this work, we found differences in virological and immune factors, including soluble inflammatory biomarkers, between subjects with persistent control of viral replication and EC that will lose virological control. The identification of these factors could be a key point for a right medical care of those EC who are going to lose natural control of viral replication and for the design of future immunotherapeutic strategies using as a model the natural persistent control of HIV infection.","2018","2018 Mar 01","María Pernas; Laura Tarancón-Diez; Esther Rodríguez-Gallego; Josep Gómez; Julia G Prado; Concepción Casado; Beatriz Dominguez-Molina; Isabel Olivares; Maite Coiras; Agathe León; Carmen Rodriguez; Jose Miguel Benito; Norma Rallón; Montserrat Plana; Onofre Martinez-Madrid; Marta Dapena; Jose Antonio Iribarren; Jorge Del Romero; Felipe García; José Alcamí; MaÁngeles Muñoz-Fernández; Francisco Vidal; Manuel Leal; Cecilio Lopez-Galindez; Ezequiel Ruiz-Mateos","Virologia Molecular Unit, Laboratory of Research and Reference in Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid.; Laboratory of Immunovirology, Institute of Biomedicine of Seville, Virgen del Rocío University Hospital/CSIC/University of Seville, Seville, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, IISPV, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, IISPV, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; AIDS Research Institute-IrsiCaixa, Institut d'Investigació en Ciències de la Salut Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.; Virologia Molecular Unit, Laboratory of Research and Reference in Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid.; Laboratory of Immunovirology, Institute of Biomedicine of Seville, Virgen del Rocío University Hospital/CSIC/University of Seville, Seville, Spain.; Virologia Molecular Unit, Laboratory of Research and Reference in Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid.; AIDS Immunopathology Unit, Laboratory of Research and Reference in Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Clinic-Fundació Clinic, IDIBAPS, HIVACAT, Universidad de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Centro Sanitario Sandoval, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria del Hospital Clínico San Carlos (IdISSC), Madrid, Spain.; IIS-Fundación Jiménez Diaz, UAM, Madrid, Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; IIS-Fundación Jiménez Diaz, UAM, Madrid, Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.; Hospital Clinic-Fundació Clinic, IDIBAPS, HIVACAT, Universidad de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Unidad Enfermedades Infecciosas, Hospital Gral Universitario Santa Lucía, Cartagena, Spain.; Servicio de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Hospital General de Castellón, Castellón, Spain.; Servicio de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Hospital Universitario Donostia, San Sebastián, Spain.; Centro Sanitario Sandoval, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria del Hospital Clínico San Carlos (IdISSC), Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Clinic-Fundació Clinic, IDIBAPS, HIVACAT, Universidad de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; AIDS Immunopathology Unit, Laboratory of Research and Reference in Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; Laboratory of Molecular Immuno-Biology, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, IiSGM, CIBER BBN, Spanish HIV HGM BioBank, Madrid, Spain.; Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, IISPV, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.; Laboratory of Immunovirology, Institute of Biomedicine of Seville, Virgen del Rocío University Hospital/CSIC/University of Seville, Seville, Spain.; Virologia Molecular Unit, Laboratory of Research and Reference in Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid.; Clinic Unit of Infectious Diseases, Microbiology and Preventive Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine of Seville, IBiS, Virgen del Rocío University Hospital/CSIC/University of Seville, Seville, Spain ezequiel.ruizmateos@gmail.com."

The HIV reservoir size was analyzed in resting memory CD4+ T-cells (Trm), pTfh, and non-pTfh cells using an ultrasensitive digital-droplet-PCR assay. Inter-group and intra-group differences were tested using non-parametric tests. Compared with the TX patients, the EC patients had smaller HIV reservoir not only in Trm but also in pTfh and non-pTfh subsets of memory CD4+ T-cells. The largest differences were observed in pTfh cells (p = 0.025). The pTfh and non-pTfh cells harbored similar levels of HIV-DNA in the EC (p = 0.60) and TX patients (p = 0.17); however, the contribution to HIV-DNA levels in memory CD4+ T-cells varied among the pTfh and non-pTfh subsets in both groups of patients.

HIV-positive individuals with extreme phenotypes of AIDS progression (n=58) at different clinical stages (chronic individuals, both pre-HAART and under-HAART) and HIV-negative controls (n=20) were evaluated. Additionally, HIV-positive individuals that initiated HAART with >350CD4+T-cells/mm3 were compared with those who initiated treatment with <350CD4+T-cells/mm3. Plasma levels of six chemokines were quantified by a Luminex assay. Higher CXCL10 levels were observed in individuals immediately before their CD4+T-cell levels were indicative for HAART (pre-HAART), independently of their progressor status, i.e. slow (SPs) or rapid progressors (RPs). SPs pre-HAART showed higher CXCL10 levels compared to elite controllers and RPs under HAART (pc=0.009 and pc=0.007, respectively). CXCL10 levels were higher in SPs HAART CD4<350 (initiated HAART with <350 CD4+T-cells) when compared with SPs HAART CD4>350 (initiated HAART with >350 CD4+T-cells) (1096 vs. 360.33pg/mL, p=0.0101). Normalisation of CXCL10 levels seems to depend on the CD4+T-cell nadir at HAART initiation. CCL20 levels were higher in chronic SPs, SPs pre-HAART, SPs HAART and RPs HAART compared with the HIV-negative controls, indicating persistent CCL20 expression.

CD8+CD28-CD127loCD39+ T cells are regulatory T (Treg) lymphocytes that are highly concentrated within the tumor microenvironment and never analyzed in the circulation of HIV-infected patients. We sought to analyze the frequency of CD8+CD28-CD127loCD39+ Treg cells in the circulation of HIV-infected patients. The frequency of circulating CD8+CD28-CD127loCD39+ Treg cells was analyzed and correlated with viral load and CD4+ T-cell counts/percentages in 93 HIV-1-infected patients subdivided as follows: naive (n = 63), elite controllers (n = 19), long-term nonprogressors (n = 7), and HIV-infected patients affected by tumor (n = 4). The same analyses were performed in HIV-negative patients with cancer (n = 53), hepatitis C virus-infected patients (n = 17), and healthy donors (n = 173). HIV-infected patients had increased circulating levels of functional CD8+CD28-CD127loCD39+ Treg cells. These cells showed antigen specificity against HIV proteins. Their frequency after antiretroviral therapy (ART) correlated with HIV viremia, CD4+ T-cell counts, and immune activation markers, suggesting their pathogenic involvement in AIDS- or non-AIDS-related complications. Their increase after initiation of ART heralded a lack of virologic or clinical response, and hence their monitoring is clinically relevant. HIV infection induces remarkable expansion of CD8+CD28-CD127loCD39+ Treg cells, the frequency of which correlates with both clinical disease and signs of chronic immune cell activation. Monitoring their frequency in the circulation is a new marker of response to ART when effects on viremia and clinical response are not met.","2018","2018 Jun","Daniela Fenoglio; Chiara Dentone; Alessio Signori; Antonio Di Biagio; Alessia Parodi; Francesca Kalli; Giorgia Nasi; Monica Curto; Giovanni Cenderello; Pasqualina De Leo; Valentina Bartolacci; Giancarlo Orofino; Laura Ambra Nicolini; Lucia Taramasso; Edoardo Fiorillo; Valeria Orrù; Paolo Traverso; Bianca Bruzzone; Federico Ivaldi; Eugenio Mantia; Michele Guerra; Simone Negrini; Mauro Giacomini; Sanjay Bhagani; Gilberto Filaci","Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy; IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria San Martino, IST-Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genoa, Italy.; Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy; Infectious Diseases Department, Sanremo Hospital, Imperia, Italy.; Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.; Infectious Disease Unit, IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria San Martino, IST-Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genoa, Italy.; Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.; Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.; Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.; Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.; Infectious Diseases Department, Galliera Hospital, Genoa, Italy.; Infectious Diseases Department, San Paolo Hospital, Savona, Italy.; S.M.

Recently several of the screening assays have been enhanced with an ability to identify p24 antigen thereby narrowing the diagnostic window. To explore the implications of enhanced HIV screening methods that may be leading to HIV misdiagnoses. A patient deemed to be an HIV infected 'elite controller' was found to be misdiagnosed when undergoing detailed investigations prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy. A root cause analysis was performed to identify the causative factors of this misdiagnosis. A retrospective review of all ""elite controllers"" in Alberta, Canada revealed challenges of current HIV testing algorithms. Technical and human factors were identified as being causative in this HIV misdiagnosis including (i) high rates of false reactive results on the Abbott ARCHITECT HIV-1&2 COMBO EIA, (ii) human error in reading the initial Western blot, (iii) HIV algorithmic directives in which confirmatory (Western blot) testing was not performed on a repeatedly reactive screen test. The outcome of this analysis identified opportunities for improvement, including implementation of a newly approved (automated) confirmatory assay and improved communication between the clinician and laboratory. HIV testing remains problematic despite significant advances in HIV test performance and algorithm development, presenting new and unexpected issues. Ensuring a high-quality management system including implementation of the latest HIV technologies and algorithms along with human resources and policies are required to minimize the impact of false positive diagnoses, especially in the era of universal screening and 'test and treat' recommendations.","2017","2017 Nov","Raynell Lang; Carmen Charlton; Brenda Beckthold; Kiana Kadivar; Stephanie Lavoie; Debbie Caswell; Paul N Levett; Greg B Horsman; John Kim; M John Gill","Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada; Provincial Laboratory of Public Health, Edmonton, Canada.; Southern Alberta HIV Clinic, Calgary, Canada.; National HIV Reference Laboratory, National Microbiology Laboratory, Winnipeg, Canada.; National HIV Reference Laboratory, National Microbiology Laboratory, Winnipeg, Canada.; Saskatchewan Disease Control Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.; Saskatchewan Disease Control Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.; Saskatchewan Disease Control Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.; National HIV Reference Laboratory, National Microbiology Laboratory, Winnipeg, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada; Southern Alberta HIV Clinic, Calgary, Canada.

However, the mechanism of nonprogression needs to be further resolved. In this study, a transcriptome meta-analysis was performed on nonprogressor and progressor microarray data to identify differential transcriptome pathways and potential biomarkers. Using the INMEX (integrative meta-analysis of expression data) program, we performed the meta-analysis to identify consistently differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in nonprogressors and further performed functional interpretation (gene ontology analysis and pathway analysis) of the DEGs identified in the meta-analysis. Five microarray datasets (81 cases and 98 controls in total), including whole blood, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, were collected for meta-analysis. We determined that nonprogressors have reduced expression of important interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), CD38, lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) in whole blood, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed a significant enrichment in DEGs that function in the type I interferon signaling pathway. Upregulated pathways, including the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in whole blood, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction in CD4+ T cells and the MAPK signaling pathway in CD8+ T cells, were identified in nonprogressors compared with progressors. In each metabolic functional category, the number of downregulated DEGs was more than the upregulated DEGs, and almost all genes were downregulated DEGs in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the three types of samples. Our transcriptomic meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of the gene expression profiles in major blood types of nonprogressors, providing new insights in the understanding of HIV pathogenesis and developing strategies to delay HIV disease progression.","2017","2017 Sep 12","Le-Le Zhang; Zi-Ning Zhang; Xian Wu; Yong-Jun Jiang; Ya-Jing Fu; Hong Shang","Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health and Family Planning Commission, Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, No 155, Nanjingbei Street, Heping District, Shenyang, 110001, Liaoning Province, China.; Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, China.; Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health and Family Planning Commission, Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, No 155, Nanjingbei Street, Heping District, Shenyang, 110001, Liaoning Province, China.; Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, China.; Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health and Family Planning Commission, Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, No 155, Nanjingbei Street, Heping District, Shenyang, 110001, Liaoning Province, China.; Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, China.; Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health and Family Planning Commission, Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, No 155, Nanjingbei Street, Heping District, Shenyang, 110001, Liaoning Province, China.; Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, China.; Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health and Family Planning Commission, Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, No 155, Nanjingbei Street, Heping District, Shenyang, 110001, Liaoning Province, China.; Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, China.; Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health and Family Planning Commission, Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, No 155, Nanjingbei Street, Heping District, Shenyang, 110001, Liaoning Province, China. hongshang100@hotmail.com.; Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, China. hongshang100@hotmail.com."

We analyzed HLA-B*57 genotype and complement levels in HIV-positive patients receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy, untreated HIV controllers, and HIV-negative subjects to identify factors associated with HIV controller status. Our results revealed that the plasma levels of three C4b-derived peptides and complement factor I outperformed all other assayed biomarkers for HIV controller identification, although we could not analyze the predictive value of biomarker combinations with the current sample size.

Here, plasma samples and paired exosome samples of 55 subjects from the observational SCOPE cohort were analysed for the presence of TAR RNA. First, a PCR-based assay was optimized, which provided 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity in differentiating HIV-1 infected non-controllers from uninfected individuals. Next, TAR RNA was detected in the plasma of 63% of aviremic HIV-1-infected patients, who were either treated with antiretroviral therapy or were elite controllers. Although TAR RNA levels did not correlate with patient gender, age, CD4 levels, CD8 levels, they tended to correlate with CD4/CD8 ratio (P = 0.047). This study is the first to investigate plasma TAR RNA in a relatively large cohort of HIV-1-infected patients.

During HIV infection, HERV-K (HML-2) specific mRNA transcripts and viral proteins can be detected. In this study, we aimed to understand the antibody response against HERV-K (HML-2) Gag in the context of HIV-1 infection. We developed an ELISA assay using either recombinant protein or 164 redundant ""15mer"" HERV-K (HML-2) Gag peptides to test sera for antibody reactivity. We identified a total of eight potential HERV-K (HML-2) Gag immunogenic domains: two on the matrix (peptides 16 and 31), one on p15 (peptide 85), three on the capsid (peptides 81, 97 and 117), one on the nucleocapsid (peptide 137) and one on the QP1 protein (peptide 157). Four epitopes (peptides 16, 31, 85 and 137) were highly immunogenic. No significant differences in antibody responses were found between HIV infected participants (n = 40) and uninfected donors (n = 40) for 6 out of the 8 epitopes tested. The antibody response against nucleocapsid (peptide 137) was significantly lower (p < 0.001), and the response to QP1 (peptide 157) significantly higher (p < 0.05) in HIV-infected adults compared to uninfected individuals. Among those with HIV infection, the level of response against p15 protein (peptide 85) was significantly lower in untreated individuals controlling HIV (""elite"" controllers) compared to untreated non-controllers (p < 0.05) and uninfected donors (p < 0.05). In contrast, the response against the capsid protein (epitopes 81 and 117) was significantly higher in controllers compared to uninfected donors (p < 0.001 and <0.05 respectively) and non-controllers (p < 0.01 and <0.05). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from study participants were tested for responses against HERV-K (HML-2) capsid recombinant peptide in gamma interferon (IFN-γ) enzyme immunospot (Elispot) assays. We found that the HERV-K (HML-2) Gag antibody and T cell response by Elispot were significantly correlated. HIV elite controllers had a strong cellular and antibody response against HERV-K (HML-2) Gag directed mainly against the Capsid region. Collectively, these data suggest that anti-HERV-K (HML-2) antibodies targeting capsid could have an immunoprotective effect in HIV infection.","2017","2017 Aug 22","Miguel de Mulder; Devi SenGupta; Steven G Deeks; Jeffrey N Martin; Christopher D Pilcher; Frederick M Hecht; Jonah B Sacha; Douglas F Nixon; Henri-Alexandre Michaud","Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Tropical Medicine, The George Washington University, Ross Hall 604, 2300 Eye St. NW, Washington, DC, 20037, USA. mdemulder@gwu.edu.; Gilead Sciences Inc., Foster City, CA, USA.; Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; HIV/AIDS Program, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; HIV/AIDS Program, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; HIV/AIDS Program, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Division of Pathobiology and Immunology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, CA, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Tropical Medicine, The George Washington University, Ross Hall 604, 2300 Eye St. NW, Washington, DC, 20037, USA.; Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Equipe Immunité et Cancer, Institut de Recherche en Cancérlogie de Montpellier, Montpellier, France."

Altogether, CD8+ T cell anti-HIV activity was evaluated in more than 200 co-cultures. Marked heterogeneity in HIV-1 replication levels was observed among the co-cultures sharing a common CD8+ T cell source. The co-cultures that exhibited greater than 50% reduction in HIV production were found to have significantly increased numbers of matching HLA class I alleles (Yates chi-square = 54.21; p < 0.001). With CD8+ T cells from HIV controllers and asymptomatic viremic individuals, matching HLA-B and/or HLA-C alleles were more predictive of strong anti-HIV activity than matching HLA-A alleles. Overall, HLA class I genotype matches were more closely associated with CD8+ T cell anti-HIV activity than supertype pairings. Antibodies against HLA class I and CD3 reduced the CD8+ T cell anti-HIV activity. Stimulated CD8+ T cells exhibited increased anti-HIV activity and reduced dependency on HLA compatibility. These findings provide evidence that the maximal suppression of HIV replication by CD8+ T cells requires the recognition of multiple epitopes. These studies provide insight for HIV vaccine development, and the analytic approach can be useful for the functional characterization of HLA class I alleles and tentative HLA class I supertypes.","2018","2018 Feb","M Scott Killian; Fernando Teque; Ramu Sudhagoni","Basic Biomedical Sciences, Sanford School of Medicine, University of South Dakota, 414 E.

In order to establish the representation of key genetic correlates of atypical disease progression within a cohort of HIV-1+ individuals who control viral replication, we examine four-digit resolution HLA type and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) previously identified to be correlated to non-progressive infection, in strictly defined HIC. Clinical histories were examined to identify patients exhibiting HIC status. Genomic DNA was extracted, and high definition HLA typing and genome-wide SNP analysis was performed. Data were compared with frequencies of SNP in European long-term non-progressors (LTNP) and primary infection cohorts. HLA-B alleles associated with atypical disease progression were at very high frequencies in the group of five HIC studied. All four HIC of European ancestry were HLA-B*57+ and half were also HLA-B*27+. All HIC, including one of self-reported African ethnicity, had the HLA-Cw*0602 allele, and the HLA-DQ9 allele was present only in HIC of European ancestry. A median 95% of the top 19 SNP known to be associated with LTNP status was observed in European HIC (range 78-100%); 17/19 of the SNP considered mapped to chromosome 6 in the HLA region, whereas 2/19 mapped to chromosome 8. The HIC investigated here demonstrated high enrichment of HLA types and SNP previously associated with long-term non-progression. These findings suggest that the extreme non-progressive phenotype considered here is associated with a genetic signature characterized by a single-genetic unit centered around the HLA-B*57 haplotype and the possible additive effect of HLA-B*27.","2017","2017","Samantha J Westrop; Alexander T H Cocker; Adriano Boasso; Ann K Sullivan; Mark R Nelson; Nesrina Imami","Centre for Immunology and Vaccinology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.; Centre for Immunology and Vaccinology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.; Centre for Immunology and Vaccinology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of HIV/GU Medicine, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, United Kingdom.; Department of HIV/GU Medicine, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, United Kingdom.; Centre for Immunology and Vaccinology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."

HIV Env-specific and non-Env-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) may contribute to protection from progressive HIV infection, but the evidence is limited. We recruited 22 ECs and matched them with 44 viremic subjects. HIV Env- and Vpu-specific ADCC responses in sera were studied using a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based dimeric recombinant soluble FcγRIIIa (rsFcγRIIIa)-binding assay, surface plasmon resonance, antibody-dependent natural killer (NK) cell activation assays, and ADCC-mediated killing assays. ECs had higher levels of HIV Env-specific antibodies capable of binding FcγRIIIa, activating NK cells, and mediating granzyme B activity (all P < 0.01) than viremic subjects. ECs also had higher levels of antibodies against a C-terminal 13-mer Vpu peptide capable of mediating FcγRIIIa binding and NK cell activation than viremic subjects (both P < 0.05). Our data associate Env-specific and Vpu epitope-specific ADCC in effective immune responses against HIV among ECs. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of ADCC in HIV control.IMPORTANCE Understanding immune responses associated with elite control of HIV may aid the development of immunotherapeutic and vaccine strategies for controlling HIV infection. Env is a major HIV protein target of functional antibody responses that are heightened in ECs. Interestingly, EC antibodies also target Vpu, an accessory protein crucial to HIV, which degrades CD4 and antagonizes tetherin. Antibodies specific to Vpu are a common feature of the immune response of ECs that may prove to be of functional importance to the design of improved ADCC-based immunotherapy and preventative HIV vaccines.","2017","2017 Sep 15","Vijaya Madhavi; Bruce D Wines; Janaki Amin; Sean Emery; ; Ester Lopez; Anthony Kelleher; ; Rob J Center; P Mark Hogarth; Amy W Chung; Stephen J Kent; Ivan Stratov","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; Centre for Biomedical Research, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Immunology, Monash University Central Clinical School, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Pathology, The University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research, Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Australia.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; Centre for Biomedical Research, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Centre for Biomedical Research, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia skent@unimelb.edu.au.; Melbourne Sexual Health Clinic and Infectious Diseases Department, Alfred Hospital, Monash University Central Clinical School, Carlton, Victoria, Australia.; ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; Melbourne Sexual Health Clinic and Infectious Diseases Department, Alfred Hospital, Monash University Central Clinical School, Carlton, Victoria, Australia."

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance and accuracy of the avidity index (AI) for discriminating for recent HIV infections. We collected serum samples from HIV-1 positive individuals: A) with known date of infection (midpoint in time between last HIV-negative and first HIV-positive test); B) infected for >1 year. Samples were divided into two aliquots: one diluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the other with 1 M guanidine. Both aliquots were assayed by the Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo 4th generation assay (Abbott). We compared AI found in recent (RI=<6 months from seroconversion) and established (EI) infections. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The proportion of samples misclassified as recent (FRR) was calculated. In total, 647 samples were collected: 455 in group A (51.6% RI and 48.4% EI) and 192 in group B. Among these, sixteen samples were from elite controllers, 294 from treated patients, 328 from patients infected with non-B subtypes. Samples before antiretroviral initiation showed a mean AI significantly lower among RI compared to EI (0.66+0.28 vs. 1.00±0.12; p<0.000). The FRR was 0% using a cut-off of ≤0.70. An extremely low FRR was observed among elite controllers, samples with low VL or CD4. HIV subtype had no impact on AI misclassifications. All individuals in group A reached the AI threshold of 0.80 within 24 months after seroconversion. The AI is an accurate serological marker for discriminating recent from established HIV infections and meets WHO requirements for HIV incidence assays.","2017","2017 Oct 26","Barbara Suligoi; Vincenza Regine; Mariangela Raimondo; Anna Rodella; Luigina Terlenghi; Arnaldo Caruso; Patrizia Bagnarelli; Maria Rosaria Capobianchi; Nadia Zanchetta; Valeria Ghisetti; Claudio Galli",".; .; .; .; .; .; .; .; .; .; ."

To determine if EC generate high quality HIV-specific IgA responses, we used Western blotting to compare the specificities and frequencies of IgA to HIV antigens in serum of gender-, age- and race-matched EC and aviremic controllers (HC) and viremic noncontrollers (HN) on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Concentrations and avidity of IgA to HIV antigens were measured using ELISA or multiplex assays. Measurements for IgG were performed in parallel. EC were found to have stronger p24- and V1V2-specific IgG responses than HN, but there were no IgG differences for EC and HC. In contrast, IgA in EC serum bound more frequently to gp160 and gag proteins than IgA in HC or HN. The avidity of anti-gp41 IgA was also greater in EC, and these subjects had stronger IgA responses to the gp41 heptad repeat region 1 (HR1), a reported target of anti-bacterial RNA polymerase antibodies that cross react with gp41. However, EC did not demonstrate greater IgA responses to E. coli RNA polymerase or to peptides containing the shared LRAI sequence, suggesting that most of their HR1-specific IgA antibodies were not induced by intestinal microbiota. In both EC and HAART recipients, the concentrations of HIV-specific IgG were greater than HIV-specific IgA, but their avidities were comparable, implying that they could compete for antigen. Exceptions were C1 peptides and V1V2 loops. IgG and IgA responses to these antigens were discordant, with IgG reacting to V1V2, and IgA reacting to C1, especially in EC. Interestingly, EC with IgG hypergammaglobulinemia had greater HIV-specific IgA and IgG responses than EC with normal total IgG levels. Heterogeneity in EC antibody responses may therefore be due to a more focused HIV-specific B cell response in some of these individuals. Overall, these data suggest that development of HIV-specific IgA responses and affinity maturation of anti-gp41 IgA antibodies occurs to a greater extent in EC than in subjects on HAART. Future studies will be required to determine if IgA antibodies in EC may contribute in control of viral replication.","2017","2017","Rafiq Nabi; Zina Moldoveanu; Qing Wei; Elizabeth T Golub; Helen G Durkin; Ruth M Greenblatt; Betsy C Herold; Marek J Nowicki; Seble Kassaye; Michael W Cho; Abraham Pinter; Alan L Landay; Jiri Mestecky; Pamela A Kozlowski","Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA, United States of America.; Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States of America.; Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States of America.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States of America.; Departments of Pathology and Medicine, SUNY Downstate, Brooklyn, NY, United States of America.; Departments of Medicine and Epidemiology/Biostastistics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Women's Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States of America.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America.; Department of Medicine, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., United States of America.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States of America.; Public Health Research Institute, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ, United States of America.; Department of Immunity and Emerging Pathogens, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States of America.; Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States of America.; Institute of immunology and Microbiology 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA, United States of America."

Kaplan-Meier methods, prevalence ratios, and Cox proportional-hazards models were used.In all, 55 HIV-infected elite controllers were included in this study. Among them, 45% were HIV/HCV coinfected and 55% were HIV mono-infected. Median follow-up time for the cohort was 11 years. Twenty-five patients experienced a complication and 16 lost elite controller status during the study period. HCV coinfected patients were 4.78 times (95% confidence interval 1.50-15.28) more likely to develop complications compared with HIV mono-infected patients. There was no association between HCV coinfection status and loss of elite control (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.27-2.06).Hepatitis C virus coinfection was significantly associated with the risk of complications even after controlling for sex, injecting drug use, and older age. HCV coinfected patients had higher levels of cellular activation while also having similar levels of lipopolysaccharide and soluble CD14. HCV coinfection was not associated with loss of elite controller status. Taken together, this suggests that HCV coinfection does not directly affect HIV replication dynamics or natural history, but that it may act synergistically with HIV to produce a greater number of associated complications. Continued follow-up will be needed to determine whether HCV cure through the use of direct-acting antivirals among HIV/HCV coinfected elite controllers will make the risk for complications among these patients similar to their HIV mono-infected counterparts.","2017","2017 Jun","Kristen A Stafford; Zahra Rikhtegaran Tehrani; Saman Saadat; Maryam Ebadi; Robert R Redfield; Mohammad M Sajadi","Institute of Human Virology Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamedan, Hamadan Province, Iran Department of Medicine, Baltimore VA Medical Center, Baltimore, MD."

In this study, we compared baseline and inducible HIV-1 mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells from ES and chronic progressors (CPs) receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Methods: We quantified basal levels of cell associated HIV-1 mRNA in CD4+ T cells isolated from CPs and ES. Additionally, we measured the fold upregulation of intracellular HIV-mRNA after stimulation of CD4+ T cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin, and quantified the amount of HIV-mRNA levels released into culture supernatant. Results: ES have significantly less cell associated HIV-mRNA per 5x106 cells (p = 0.003); 8 of 10 CPs had quantifiable HIV-1 mRNA at baseline, whereas this was present in only 2 of 10 ES. Upon stimulation with PMA and ionomycin, 4 of 5 CPs and 7 of 9 ES showed increased cell associated HIV-mRNA. Interestingly, released HIV-1 mRNA could be detected in supernatants of CD4+ T cells stimulated with PMA/ionomycin from 5 of 8 ES.

Residual CD4 left at the plasma membrane allows Env-CD4 interaction, which leads to increased exposure of Env CD4-induced epitopes and increases susceptibility of infected cells to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC is mediated largely by natural killer (NK) cells, which control their activation status through the cumulative signals received through activating and inhibitory receptors. Recently, the activating NKG2D receptor was demonstrated to positively influence ADCC responses. Since HIV-1 Nef has been reported to reduce the expression of NKG2D ligands, we evaluated the relative abilities of Nef from EC and progressors to downmodulate NKG2D ligands. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of EC and progressor Nef on the ADCC susceptibility of HIV-1-infected cells. We observed a significantly increased expression of NKG2D ligands on cells infected with viruses coding for Nef from EC. Importantly, NKG2D ligand expression levels correlated with enhanced susceptibility of HIV-1-infected cells to ADCC. The biological significance of this correlation was corroborated by the demonstration that antibody-mediated blockade of NKG2D significantly reduced ADCC of cells infected with viruses carrying Nef from EC. These results suggest the involvement of NKG2D-NKG2D ligand interactions in the enhanced susceptibility of EC HIV-1-infected cells to ADCC responses.IMPORTANCE Attenuated Nef functions have been reported in HIV-1 isolated from EC. The inability of elite controller Nef to fully remove CD4 from the surface of infected cells enhanced their susceptibility to elimination by ADCC. We now show that downregulation of NKG2D ligands by HIV-1 Nef from EC is inefficient and leaves infected cells susceptible to ADCC. These data suggest a critical role for NKG2D ligands in anti-HIV-1 ADCC responses.","2017","2017 Aug 15","Nirmin Alsahafi; Jonathan Richard; Jérémie Prévost; Mathieu Coutu; Nathalie Brassard; Matthew S Parsons; Daniel E Kaufmann; Mark Brockman; Andrés Finzi","Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Department of Microbiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Department of Microbiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Department of Microbiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA.; Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada.; British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Montreal, QC, Canada andres.finzi@umontreal.ca.; Department of Microbiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada."

Infected persons were regularly examined and submitted to two or three annual laboratory measurements. Polymorphisms and allele frequencies of CCR5Δ32 and SDF1-3'A were detected in the genomic DNA. Plasma levels of cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17 and IFN-y) were measured. The group investigated is originated from a miscigenetic population and demographic and social characteristics were not significantly relevant. LTCD4+ median values were higher among VC than NC, but significantly lower than uninfected controls. Evolution of LTCD4+ and LTCD8+ counts, showed a slight increase of LTCD4+ among VC, but a significant decrease in the NC. The percentage of annual change in LTCD4+ was also significantly different between the groups. LTCD4+/LTCD8+ ratio was inverted but not significant among the VC, thus the ratio may be a useful biomarker for the VC. A clear signature indicated a change from Th1 to Th2 cytokine profiles from VC to NC, respectively.

We investigated whether HIV antibody responses as measured by high-throughput quantitative and qualitative assays could be used to indirectly measure persistent HIV replication in individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV antibody responses were measured over time in the presence or absence of suppressive ART and were compared to the HIV reservoir size and expression of antiviral restriction factors. Among untreated individuals, including both elite controllers (ie, persons with a viral load of ≤40 copies/mL) and noncontrollers, antibody parameters were stable over time and correlated with the individual viral load. Viral suppression with ART led to a progressive decline in antibody responses after treatment induction that persisted for 5-7 years. Higher levels of HIV antibodies during suppressive therapy were associated with later initiation of ART after infection, with higher DNA and cell-associated RNA levels, and with lower expression of multiple anti-HIV host restriction factors. These findings suggest that declining antibody levels during ART reflect lower levels of antigen production and/or viral replication in the persistent HIV reservoir. Results of relatively inexpensive and quantitative HIV antibody assays may be useful indirect markers that enable efficient monitoring of the viral reservoir and suppression during functional-cure interventions.","2017","2017 Jul 01","Sheila M Keating; Christopher D Pilcher; Vivek Jain; Mila Lebedeva; Dylan Hampton; Mohamed Abdel-Mohsen; Xutao Deng; Gary Murphy; Alex Welte; Shelley N Facente; Frederick Hecht; Steven G Deeks; Satish K Pillai; Michael P Busch","Blood Systems Research Institute.; Department of Laboratory Medicine.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California.; Blood Systems Research Institute.; Blood Systems Research Institute.; The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.; Blood Systems Research Institute.; Public Health England, London, United Kingdom.; South African Department of Science and Technology, National Research Foundation Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis, Stellenbosch, South Africa.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California.; Blood Systems Research Institute.; Department of Laboratory Medicine.; Blood Systems Research Institute.; Department of Laboratory Medicine."

In HIV infection, this epigenetic regulation plays a cardinal role in HIV RNA production that silences HIV transcription at a molecular (RNA) level, controls viral load at a cellular (biological) level, and governs the viremic stage of AIDS at the clinical (patient) level. Even though the human genome is largely similar among humans and HIV is a single viral species, human hosts show significant differences in viral RNA levels, ranging from cell to organ to individual and expressed as elite controllers, posttreatment controllers, and patients with AIDS. These are signature biomarkers of typical epigenetic regulation whose importance has been shunted aside by interpreting all of AIDS pathogenesis by the known properties of innate and adaptive immunity. We propose that harnessing the host genome immune system, defined as epigenetic immunity, against HIV infection will lead toward a cure.","2017","2017 Mar-Apr","Jielin Zhang; Clyde S Crumpacker","Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."

HIV infection induces significant chronic immune activation, phenotypic skewing, and inflammation driven by years of continuous viral replication. High levels of viremia as well as immune activation and dysfunction have been demonstrated to have a perturbing impact on the B cell memory compartment and contribute to B cell exhaustion. Counterintuitively, the factors associated with perturbation of the B cell compartment seem to be favorable for the generation of highly affinity-matured Env-specific antibodies in a minority of HIV-infected individuals. Thus, the impact of HIV antigenemia on B cells and Tfh cell interactions warrants further exploration. We therefore studied immunophenotypes of HIV-specific B cells in individuals with differing levels of viral control using HIV Env gp120 probes and characterized the functionality of matched T cells in peripheral blood. While CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells were significantly diminished in HIV progressors, we found that a small subset of gp120-specific interleukin-21 (IL-21)-secreting CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells were significantly associated with gp120-specific B cell frequencies. In contrast, neither bulk CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells nor other HIV antigen specificities were associated with gp120-specific B cell levels. HIV-specific B cells derived from elite controllers displayed greater amounts of gp120-specific B cells in the resting memory subset, whereas HIV-specific B cells in progressors accumulated in tissue-like and activated memory subsets. Furthermore, CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells from elite controllers showed a stronger ex vivo capacity to induce B cell maturation and immunoglobulin class switching than cells from HIV progressors.IMPORTANCE Dissecting the factors that are involved in B cell maturation and antibody development is important for HIV vaccine design. In this study, we found that HIV Env-specific CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells that secrete interleukin-21 are strongly associated with B cell memory phenotypes and function. Moreover, we found that the immune responses of HIV controllers showed intrinsically better helper activity than those of HIV progressors.","2017","2017 Jul 15","Supranee Buranapraditkun; Franco Pissani; Jeffrey E Teigler; Bruce T Schultz; Galit Alter; Mary Marovich; Merlin L Robb; Michael A Eller; Jeff Martin; Steven Deeks; Nelson L Michael; Hendrik Streeck","U.S. Military HIV Research Program, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.; Henry M.

Detection of evolution at the DNA proviral compartment in HIV controllers, however, has been more challenging and the precise correlation between the systemic viral suppression level and rate of reservoir's reseeding in those individuals is not fully understood. In this sense, we examined the proviral DNA quasispecies by single genome amplification of the env gene in a cohort of 23 HIV controllers from Brazil, divided in three groups, according to the level of systemic viral suppression: (1) elite controllers with persistent undetectable viral load (PEC, n = 6); (2) elite controllers with occasional episodes of transient (51-400 copies/mL) viremia (EEC, n = 7); and (3) viremic controllers with persistent low-level (80-2000 copies/mL) viremia (VC, n = 10). The HIV-1 diversity of the PBMC-associated proviral quasispecies in EC was significantly (P < 0.01) lower than in VC, but not significantly different between PEC and EEC groups. We detected a considerable variation in the average pairwise nucleotide distance and proportion of unique sequences in the HIV-1 proviral quasispecies of PEC and EEC. Some PEC and EEC displayed highly homogenous proviral populations with large clusters of identical sequences, while others exhibited relatively diverse proviral populations with a high proportion of unique sequences comparable to VC subjects. The long-term (10-15 years) follow-up of the HIV-1 proviral populations revealed a complete evolutionary stasis in one PEC and measurable divergence rates in one EEC [3.1 (1.2-5.6) × 10-3 substitutions/site/year and one VC [2.9 (0.7-5.1) × 10-3 substitutions/site/year]. There is no simple relationship between systemic viral suppression and intra-host proviral diversity or rate of reservoir's reseeding in chronically infected HIV controllers. Our results demonstrate that very divergent patterns of intra-host viral diversity and divergence could be detected in the setting of natural suppression of HIV-1 replication and that ongoing evolution and reseeding of the PBMC proviral reservoir occurs in some elite controllers.","2017","2017 May 02","Suwellen S D de Azevedo; Diogo Gama Caetano; Fernanda H Côrtes; Sylvia L M Teixeira; Karina Dos Santos Silva; Brenda Hoagland; Beatriz Grinsztejn; Valdilea G Veloso; Mariza G Morgado; Gonzalo Bello","Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz - FIOCRUZ, Av.

We performed antibody profiling of HIV-1 proteomes using LIPS in viremic progressors (n = 38), elite controllers (ECs; n = 19) and patients with fully suppressive long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) (n = 19) (mean 17 years). IgG was quantified against six HIV-1 fusion proteins: p24, gp41, RT, Tat, integrase and protease. Lower antibody levels to all six-fusion proteins were observed in long-term ART patients compared to viremics (p < 0.05). In contrast ECs had lower antibody levels only against Tat and Integrase (p < 0.05). Principal component analysis and cluster-network analysis identified that 68% (13/19) of the long-term ART patients clustered together with 26% (5/19) ECs. The remaining ECs clustered together with the viremics indicating non-homogeneity among the ECs.

To define the role of individual T-cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes in differential antiviral CD8+ T-cell function, we performed detailed functional and mass cytometric cluster analysis of multiple CD8+ T-cell clones recognizing the identical HLA-B*2705-restricted HIV-1 epitope KK10 (KRWIILGLNK). Effective and ineffective CD8+ T-cell clones segregated based on responses to HIV-1-infected and peptide-loaded target cells. Following cognate peptide stimulation, effective HIV-specific clones displayed significantly more rapid TCR signal propagation, more efficient initial lytic granule release, and more sustained nonlytic cytokine and chemokine secretion than ineffective clones. To evaluate the TCR clonotype contribution to CD8+ T-cell function, we cloned the TCR α and β chain genes from one effective and two ineffective CD8+ T-cell clones from an elite controller into TCR-expressing lentivectors. We show that Jurkat/MA cells and primary CD8+ T cells transduced with lentivirus expressing TCR from one of the ineffective clones exhibited a level of activation by cognate peptide and inhibition of in vitro HIV-1 infection, respectively, that were comparable to those of the effective clonotype. Taken together, these data suggest that the potent antiviral capacity of some HIV-specific CD8+ T cells is a consequence of factors in addition to TCR sequence that modulate functionality and contribute to the increased antiviral capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in elite controllers to inhibit HIV infection.IMPORTANCE The greater ex vivo antiviral inhibitory activity of CD8+ T cells from elite controllers than from HIV-1 progressors supports the crucial role of effective HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in controlling HIV-1 replication.

RICH2 links tetherin to the cortical actin network and the RICH2/tetherin interaction has been shown to be important for the downstream activation of NF-κβ and the consequential promotion of proinflammatory responses. We investigated the role of these two SNPs in natural control of HIV-1 in black South Africans including healthy controls (HCs; N=102) and antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected controllers (HICs; N=52) and progressors (N=74). HICs were stratified as elite controllers (ECs; N=11), viraemic controllers (VCs; N=30), high viral load (VL) long term non-progressors (HVL LTNPs; N=11) and also according to VL<400RNA copies/ml (HICs VL<400; N=20) and VL>400RNA copies/ml (HICs VL>400; N=32). Results showed that in contrast to Caucasians who had very strong LD between these SNPs (r2=0.97), black populations exhibited low LD (r2=0.11-0.27), however a 254e minor allele was always present with a 255i minor allele but not vice versa. The SNPs did not show significant over- or underrepresentation in any particular group, however the combination of 254e major allele homozygosity and 255i heterozygosity (254eAA/255iGA) was underrepresented in HICs (OR=3.26; P=0.04) and VCs (OR=7.77; P=0.02) compared to HCs, and in HICs VL>400 compared to both HCs (P=0.002) and progressors (P=0.02). A lower CD4+ T-cell count was associated with 254eAA/255iGA and 255i (GA+AA) in the total HIV-1-infected group (P=0.043) and progressors (P=0.017), respectively. In silico analysis predicted loss of an exonic splice enhancer site with the 254e-G allele. We postulate that altered splicing of RICH2 will affect levels of RICH2 expression and consequently NF-κβ activation.

Systemic cytokine responses may differentiate ECs from subjects with uncontrolled viral replication or from those who require ART to suppress viral replication. We measured 87 cytokines in four groups of women: 73 ECs, 42 with pharmacologically suppressed viremia (ART), 42 with uncontrolled viral replication (noncontrollers [NCs]), and 48 HIV-uninfected (NEG) subjects. Four cytokines were elevated in ECs but not NCs or ART subjects: CCL14, CCL21, CCL27, and XCL1. In addition, median stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) levels were 43% higher in ECs than in NCs. The combination of the five cytokines suppressed R5 and X4 virus replication in resting CD4+ T cells, and individually SDF-1β, CCL14, and CCL27 suppressed R5 virus replication, while SDF-1β, CCL21, and CCL14 suppressed X4 virus replication. Functional studies revealed that the combination of the five cytokines upregulated CD69 and CCR5 and downregulated CXCR4 and CCR7 on CD4+ T cells. The CD69 and CXCR4 effects were driven by SDF-1, while CCL21 downregulated CCR7. The combination of the EC-associated cytokines induced expression of the anti-HIV host restriction factors IFITM1 and IFITM2 and suppressed expression of RNase L and SAMHD1. These results identify a set of cytokines that are elevated in ECs and define their effects on cellular activation, HIV coreceptor expression, and innate restriction factor expression. This cytokine pattern may be a signature characteristic of HIV-1 elite control, potentially important for HIV therapeutic and curative strategies.IMPORTANCE Approximately 1% of people infected with HIV control virus replication without taking antiviral medications. These subjects, termed elite controllers (ECs), are known to have stronger immune responses targeting HIV than the typical HIV-infected subject, but the exact mechanisms of how their immune responses control infection are not known. In this study, we identified five soluble immune signaling molecules (cytokines) in the blood that were higher in ECs than in subjects with typical chronic HIV infection. We demonstrated that these cytokines can activate CD4+ T cells, the target cells for HIV infection. Furthermore, these five EC-associated cytokines could change expression levels of intrinsic resistance factors, or molecules inside the target cell that fight HIV infection. This study is significant in that it identified cytokines elevated in subjects with a good immune response against HIV and defined potential mechanisms as to how these cytokines could induce resistance to the virus in target cells.","2017","2017 Mar 15","Evan S Jacobs; Sheila M Keating; Mohamed Abdel-Mohsen; Stuart L Gibb; John W Heitman; Heather C Inglis; Jeffrey N Martin; Jinbing Zhang; Zhanna Kaidarova; Xutao Deng; Shiquan Wu; Kathryn Anastos; Howard Crystal; Maria C Villacres; Mary Young; Ruth M Greenblatt; Alan L Landay; Stephen J Gange; Steven G Deeks; Elizabeth T Golub; Satish K Pillai; Philip J Norris","Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA skeating@bloodsystems.org pnorris@bloodsystems.org.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA.; SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York, USA.; Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Pharmacy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA skeating@bloodsystems.org pnorris@bloodsystems.org.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA."

The goal of this work was to analyze the utility of systematic isolation of different immune cell subsets by immunomagnetic separation and the RNA integrity after isolated cells from samples of HIV-infected patients. PBMC from Healthy Controls (HC, n=15), Elite Controllers (EC, n=15), Viremic Controllers (VC, n=15), Viremic Progressors (VP, n=15) and HIV-infected patients on therapy (ART, n=15) were isolated by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. Subsets were separated with monoclonal antibodies (CD56, CD14, CD4, and CD8) conjugated to microbeads. We evaluated the yield and purity of each subset isolated from PBMCs under resting and activated conditions; LPS, anti-CD3/CD28 and anti-CD16 were used to activate monocytes, PBMC, T cells and NK cells, respectively. The quality of extracted RNA was tested by 2100 Bioanalyzer. In resting conditions, the average yield of CD14+ (monocytes) was decreased (p=0.021) in HIV+ patients compared with healthy controls. CD56+ (Natural Killer-NKs; p=0.03) and CD8+ (Cytotoxic T lymphocytes-CTL p=0.001) cells were increased in HIV+ patients after 72h of activation. The purity assay detected significant differences in CD14+ (p≤0.001) and CD8+ (p=0.034) subpopulations when comparing PBMC isolated either from healthy controls or HIV+ patients. The number of activated cells in HIV+ presented differences in CD8 subset (p=0.003). Finally, similar quantities of high quality RNA were extracted from immune cells subsets obtained by our method. Specifically, we show that Bioanalyzer electrophenograms reveal optimal RIN values in HIV positive and negative patients in resting condition (EC:8;HC:6.5;VC:8.80;VP:8;HAART:7.5) and activated condition (EC:9;HC:6.7;VC:8.2;VP:7.2;HAART:8.6). This method allowed us to obtain a sufficient quantity of different isolated immune cell subsets from HIV-infected individuals at different disease stages. Moreover, the assessed qualities of nucleic acids allow us to perform subsequent molecular studies, such as microRNA profiling.","2017","2017 Mar","Manel E Bargalló; Alberto C Guardo; Maria J Maleno; Laia Miralles; Lander Egaña-Gorroño; Tuixent Escribà; Felipe García; Jose M Gatell; Mireia Arnedo; Montserrat Plana","Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.

A targeted quantitative tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics approach was used in order to determine plasma metabolomics biosignature that may relate to HIV infection, pace of HIV disease progression, and immunological response to treatment. Twenty-five unique metabolites were identified, including five metabolites that could distinguish rapid progressors and INRs at baseline. Severe deregulation in acylcarnitine and sphingomyelin metabolism compatible with mitochondrial deficiencies was observed. β-oxidation and sphingosine-1-phosphate-phosphatase-1 activity were down-regulated, whereas acyl-alkyl-containing phosphatidylcholines and alkylglyceronephosphate synthase levels were elevated in INRs. Evidence that elite controllers harbor an inborn error of metabolism (late-onset multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency [MADD]) was detected. Blood-based markers from metabolomics show a very high accuracy of discriminating HIV infection between varieties of controls and have the ability to predict rapid disease progression or poor antiretroviral immunological response. These metabolites can be used as biomarkers of HIV natural evolution or treatment response and provide insight into the mechanisms of the disease.","2016","2016","Bruno Scarpellini; Michelle Zanoni; Maria Cecilia Araripe Sucupira; Hong-Ha M Truong; Luiz Mario Ramos Janini; Ismael Dale Cotrin Segurado; Ricardo Sobhie Diaz","Federal University of Sao Paulo, Department of Medicine, Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil.; Federal University of Sao Paulo, Department of Medicine, Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil.; Federal University of Sao Paulo, Department of Medicine, Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil.; University of California at San Francisco, Department of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.; Federal University of Sao Paulo, Department of Medicine, Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil.; Federal University of Sao Paulo, Department of Microbiology, Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil.; Federal University of Sao Paulo, Department of Medicine, Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil.; Federal University of Sao Paulo, Department of Medicine, Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil."

Despite the critical, causal role of virus replication in determining transmissibility and kinetics of progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), there is limited understanding of the conditions required to transform the small localized transmitted founder virus population into a large and heterogeneous systemic infection. Here we show that during the hyperacute ""pre-peak"" phase of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in macaques, high levels of microbial DNA transiently translocate into peripheral blood. This, heretofore unappreciated, hyperacute-phase microbial translocation was accompanied by sustained reduction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-specific antibody titer, intestinal permeability, increased abundance of CD4+CCR5+ T cell targets of virus replication, and T cell activation. To test whether increasing gastrointestinal permeability to cause microbial translocation would amplify viremia, we treated two SIV-infected macaque 'elite controllers' with a short-course of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-stimulating a transient increase in microbial translocation and a prolonged recrudescent viremia. Altogether, our data implicates translocating microbes as amplifiers of immunodeficiency virus replication that effectively undermine the host's capacity to contain infection.","2016","2016 Dec","Adam J Ericsen; Michael Lauck; Mariel S Mohns; Sarah R DiNapoli; James P Mutschler; Justin M Greene; Jason T Weinfurter; Gabrielle Lehrer-Brey; Trent M Prall; Samantha M Gieger; Connor R Buechler; Kristin A Crosno; Eric J Peterson; Matthew R Reynolds; Roger W Wiseman; Benjamin J Burwitz; Jacob D Estes; Jonah B Sacha; Thomas C Friedrich; Jason M Brenchley; David H O'Connor","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Virology Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States Of America.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute, Oregon National Primate Research Center, and Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, United States Of America.; AIDS and Cancer Virus Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick, Maryland, United States Of America.; Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute, Oregon National Primate Research Center, and Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, United States Of America.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Department of Pathobiological Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States Of America.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, Wisconsin, United States Of America."

We also measured antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as a function of the clinical status of the patients. We purified antibodies to CD4 and gp120 and assessed them for specificity, ability to block gp120 binding to target cells, ability to block virus infection, and ability to facilitate ADCC. All of the HIV+ patient samples were positive for antibodies to HIV gp120 and p24 and 80% showed evidence of hypergammaglobulinemia. Approximately 10% of cohort members were positive for antibodies to CD4, but we noted no significant correlation relevant to DP. There were statistically significant differences between the groups concerning the level of humoral response to gp120 and Gag. However, we observed no distinction in ability of anti-gp120 antibodies purified from each group to neutralize infection. In addition, there was a statistically significant difference in ADCC, with elite controllers exhibiting significantly lower levels of ADCC than the other five groups. We detected IgA anti-gp120 antibodies, but did not correlate their presence with either DP or ADCC levels. The results are consistent with the interpretation that the humoral antibody response to the antigens assessed here represents a signature of the level of viremia but does not correlate with clinical status of HIV infection.","2016","2016 Dec","Elizabeth Fink; Katherine Fuller; Brian Agan; Edward A Berger; Andrew Saphire; Gerald V Quinnan; John H Elder","1 Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla, California.; 1 Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla, California.; 2 Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences , Bethesda, Maryland.; 3 Henry M.

Levels of integrated HIV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were longitudinally monitored before and after antiviral therapy. HIV integration increased over time in both elite controllers (ECs; n = 8) and noncontrollers (NCs; n = 6) before ART, whereas integration remained stable in patients on ART (n = 4). The median annual fold change was higher in NCs than in ECs and negatively correlated with CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function as assessed by infected CD4 T-cell elimination (ICE) and granzyme B activity did not significantly change over time in ECs, suggesting that the gradual increase in integrated HIV DNA observed in ECs was not a result of progressive loss of immune-mediated control. Also, acutely infected (n = 7) but not chronically infected (n = 6) patients exhibited a significant drop in integrated HIV DNA 12 months after ART initiation. In conclusion, in the absence of ART, integrated HIV accumulates over time both in NCs and in ECs, at variable individual rates. Starting ART early in infection leads to a greater drop in integrated HIV DNA than does initiating treatment after years of infection. The increase in integrated HIV DNA over time suggests that early treatment may be of benefit in limiting HIV reservoirs. The establishment of a latent reservoir represents a barrier to cure among HIV-infected individuals. The dynamics of HIV reservoir accumulation over time in patients before antiviral therapy is underexplored, in large part because it is difficult to accurately and reproducibly measure the size of HIV reservoir in this setting. In our study, we compared the dynamics of integrated HIV DNA over time in ECs and NCs before and after ART was initiated. We found that integrated HIV DNA levels progressively increase over time in the absence of ART, but with a higher, albeit variable, rate in NCs compared to ECs. In addition, integrated HIV DNA declines more dramatically when ART is initiated in acute rather than chronic HIV infection, suggesting important differences between acute and chronic infection. Our study highlights the role of HIV replication and CTL control in reservoir accumulation in sanctuary sites and why ART appears to be more effective in acute infection.","2016","2016 Dec 01","Marilia Rita Pinzone; Erin Graf; Lindsay Lynch; Brigit McLaughlin; Frederick M Hecht; Mark Connors; Stephen A Migueles; Wei-Ting Hwang; Giuseppe Nunnari; Una O'Doherty","Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, and Positive Health Program, San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, California, USA.; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA unao@mail.med.upenn.edu."

In contrast, both blood BLyS levels and frequencies of this population remained unaltered in HIV elite-controllers. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that control of BLyS and innate B-cell status could be associated with natural immunity against HIV infection. Therefore, we assessed blood BLyS levels and B-cell status in HIV highly-exposed commercial sex workers (CSWs) from Benin. We found blood BLyS levels of HIV-uninfected CSWs were lower than those observed in both HIV-infected CSW and HIV-uninfected non-CSW groups. Furthermore, levels of BLyS expression on blood T-cells and monocytes were lower in HIV-uninfected CSWs when compared to HIV-infected CSWs, but higher than those observed for HIV-uninfected non-CSWs. Concomitantly, HIV-infected CSWs presented a dysregulated blood B-cell compartment, characterized by increased total IgG1, increased frequencies of populations presenting immature and/or innate profiles and a higher ratio of IgG(+)/IgA(+) plasmablasts.

Higher liver fibrosis was associated with significantly low CD4+ T cell counts (P < 0.001, coefficient r = -0.463). Immune activation varied by HIV phenotype but was not modified by HCV viremia. HCV viremia was associated with elevated CD8 T-cell Caspase-3 in Elites, ARTuc, and HIV- except ARTc. CD8 T-cell Caspase-3 levels were significantly higher in HCV RNA+ Elites (P = 0.04) and ARTuc (P = 0.001) and HIV- groups (P = 0.02) than ARTc. Importantly, ARTuc HCV RNA+ had significantly higher CD4 T-cell interleukin-17 levels than ARTuc HCV RNA- (P = 0.005).HIV control was associated with lower liver fibrosis in HCV/HIV co-infected women. HCV viremia is associated with an inflammatory CD4 TH-17 phenotype in absence of HIV control and higher frequency of pro-apoptosis CD8 T-cells critical to avert progression of HIV and HCV disease that is attenuated in ART controllers. Elite controllers with HCV viremia are more prone to CD8 T-cell apoptosis than ART controllers, which could have negative consequences over time, highlighting the importance of ART control in HCV/HIV coinfected individuals.","2016","2016 Aug","Seema N Desai; Jennifer L Dodge; Alan L Landay; Marshall J Glesby; Patricia S Latham; Maria C Villacres; Audrey L French; Stephen J Gange; Ruth M Greenblatt; Marion G Peters","Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY George Washington University, Washington, DC University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA Stroger Hospital Cook County, Chicago, IL Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD."

The potential for optimizing recent infection testing algorithms (RITAs), by introducing viral load criteria and tuning thresholds used to dichotomize quantitative measures, is explored. The Consortium for the Evaluation and Performance of HIV Incidence Assays characterized over 2000 possible RITAs constructed from seven assays (Limiting Antigen, BED, Less-sensitive Vitros, Vitros Avidity, BioRad Avidity, Architect Avidity, and Geenius) applied to 2500 diverse specimens. MDRIs were estimated using regression, and FRRs as observed 'recent' proportions, in various specimen sets. Context-specific FRRs were estimated for hypothetical scenarios. FRRs were made directly comparable by constructing RITAs with the same MDRI through the tuning of thresholds. RITA utility was summarized by the precision of incidence estimation. All assays produce high FRRs among treated patients and elite controllers (10-80%). Viral load testing reduces FRRs, but diminishes MDRIs. Context-specific FRRs vary substantially by scenario - BioRad Avidity and Limiting Antigen provided the lowest FRRs and highest incidence precision in scenarios considered. The introduction of a low viral load threshold provides crucial improvements in RITAs. However, it does not eliminate nonzero FRRs, and MDRIs must be consistently estimated. The tuning of thresholds is essential for comparing and optimizing the use of assays. The translation of directly measured FRRs into context-specific FRRs critically affects their magnitudes and our understanding of the utility of assays.","2016","2016 Sep 24","Reshma Kassanjee; Christopher D Pilcher; Michael P Busch; Gary Murphy; Shelley N Facente; Sheila M Keating; Elaine Mckinney; Kara Marson; Matthew A Price; Jeffrey N Martin; Susan J Little; Frederick M Hecht; Esper G Kallas; Alex Welte; ","aThe South African DST/NRF Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA), Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch bDepartment of Statistical Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa cUniversity of California dBlood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA ePublic Health England, London, UK fInternational AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), Department of Medical Affairs, New York City, New York gDepartment of Medicine, University of California San Diego, San Diego, California, USA hDivision of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, School of Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. *Christopher D.

The combination of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor romidepsin and protein kinase C (PKC) agonist bryostatin-1 is very effective at reversing latency in vitro. However, we found that primary HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cells were not able to eliminate autologous resting CD4+ T cells that had been reactivated with these drugs. We tested the hypothesis that the drugs affected primary CD8+ T cell function and found that both agents had inhibitory effects on the suppressive capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells from patients who control viral replication without antiretroviral therapy (elite suppressors/controllers). The inhibitory effect was additive and multi-factorial in nature. These inhibitory effects were not seen with prostratin, another PKC agonist, either alone or in combination with JQ1, a bromodomain-containing protein 4 inhibitor. Our results suggest that because of their adverse effects on primary CD8+ T cells, some LRAs may cause immune-suppression and therefore should be used with caution in shock and kill strategies.","2016","2016 Jun","Victoria E Walker-Sperling; Christopher W Pohlmeyer; Patrick M Tarwater; Joel N Blankson","Center for AIDS Research, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, USA.; Center for AIDS Research, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, USA.; Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Paul L.

Both groups of patients represent the most promising candidates for interventions aimed at sustained remission or 'cure'. Analytic treatment interruption (ATI) in the latter group leads to stochastic rebound of virus, though it is unclear whether loss of elite control is also associated with similar rebound characteristics. We studied three discrete periods of virus rebound during myeloma related immune disruption over 2.5 years in an elite controller who previously underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in the absence of any antiretroviral therapy. Single genome sequencing of the V1-V4 region of env in PBMC and plasma was performed and phylogenies reconstructed. Average pairwise distance (APD) was calculated and non-parametric methods used to assess compartmentalisation. Coreceptor usage was predicted based on genotypic algorithms. 122 single genome sequences were obtained (median 26 sequences per rebound). The initial rebounding plasma env sequences following ASCT represented two distinct lineages, and clustered with proviral DNA sequences isolated prior to ASCT. One of the lineages was monophyletic, possibly indicating reactivation from clonally expanded cells. The second rebound occurred 470 days after spontaneous control of the first rebound and was phylogenetically distinct from the first, confirmed by compartmentalisation analysis, with a different cellular origin rather than ongoing replication. By contrast, third rebound viruses clustered with second rebound viruses, with evidence for ongoing evolution that was associated with lymphopenia and myeloma progression. Following ASCT a shift in tropism from CXCR4-tropic viruses to a CCR5-tropic population was observed to persist through to the third rebound. Our data highlight similarities in the viral reservoir between elite and non-controllers undergoing ATI following allogeneic transplantation. The lack of propagation of CXCR4 using viruses following transplantation warrants further study.","2016","2016","Sarah A Watters; Petra Mlcochova; Frank Maldarelli; Nilu Goonetilleke; Deenan Pillay; Ravindra K Gupta","Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, NCI, Frederick, Maryland, United States of America.; Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, NCI, Frederick, Maryland, United States of America.; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.; Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies, Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.; Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London, United Kingdom."

However, along with relatively normal BLyS/BAFF expression levels, these cells remain unaltered in elite-controllers (EC), rather, percentages of more mature MZ-like B-cells are decreased in the blood of these individuals. Fluctuations in frequencies of blood MZ-like B-cell populations may reflect migratory patterns associated with disease progression status, suggesting an important role for these cells in HIV-1 pathogenesis. We have therefore longitudinally measured plasma levels of B-tropic chemokines by ELISA-based technology as well as their ligands by flow-cytometry on blood B-cell populations of HIV-1-infected individuals with different rates of disease progression and uninfected controls. Migration potential of B-cell populations from these individuals were determined by chemotaxis assays. We found important modulations of CXCL13-CXCR5, CXCL12-CXCR4/CXCR7, CCL20-CCR6 and CCL25-CCR9 chemokine-axes and increased cell migration patterns in HIV progressors. Interestingly, frequencies of CCR6 expressing cells were significantly elevated within the precursor MZ-like population, consistent with increased migration in response to CCL20. Although we found little modulation of chemokine-axes in EC, cell migration was greater than that observed for uninfected controls, especially for MZ-like B-cells. Overall the immune response against HIV-1 may involve recruitment of MZ-like B-cells to peripheral sites. Moreover, our findings suggest that ""regulated"" attraction of these cells in a preserved BLyS/BAFF non-inflammatory environment, such as encountered in EC could be beneficial to the battle and even control of HIV.","2016","2016","Julie Gauvin; Josiane Chagnon-Choquet; Johanne Poudrier; Michel Roger; ","Laboratoire d'immunogénétique, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Département de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Laboratoire d'immunogénétique, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Département de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Laboratoire d'immunogénétique, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Département de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Laboratoire d'immunogénétique, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.; Département de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada."

After background correction, quantile normalization and median polish summarization, normalized data were fit to a linear model. The analysis comprised: resting samples between groups; stimulated samples between groups; and stimulated versus resting samples within each group. Enrichment analyses of the putative target genes were perfomed using bioinformatic algorithms. A downregulated miRNA pattern was observed when resting samples from all infected groups were compared to HIV-. A miRNA downregulation was also observed when stimulated samples from EC, ART and HIV- groups were compared to VP, being hsa-miR-4492 the most downregulated. Although a preferential miRNA downregulation was observed when stimulated samples were compared to the respective resting samples, VP presented a differential miRNA expression pattern. In fact, hsa-miR-155 and hsa-miR-181a were downregulated in VP whereas in the other groups, either an upregulation or no differences were observed after stimulation, respectively. Overall, functional enrichment analysis revealed that the predicted target genes were involved in signal transduction pathways, metabolic regulation, apoptosis, and immune response. Resting CD8+ T-cells do not exhibit a differential miRNA expression between HIV-infected individuals but they do differ from non-infected individuals. Moreover, a specific miRNA pattern is present in stimulated CD8+ T-cells from VP which could reflect a detrimental pattern in terms of CD8+ T-cell immune response.","2016","2016","Lander Egaña-Gorroño; Alberto C Guardo; Manel E Bargalló; Evarist Planet; Elisenda Vilaplana; Tuixent Escribà; Iñaki Pérez; Josep Maria Gatell; Felipe García; Mireia Arnedo; Montserrat Plana M; ","Group of Genomics and Pharmacogenomics of HIV, AIDS Research Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Immunopathology and Cellular Immunology, AIDS Research Group, Catalan project for the development of an HIV vaccine (HIVACAT), Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Immunopathology and Cellular Immunology, AIDS Research Group, Catalan project for the development of an HIV vaccine (HIVACAT), Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.; Group of Genomics and Pharmacogenomics of HIV, AIDS Research Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Systems Biology, University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia, Vic, Spain.; Group of Genomics and Pharmacogenomics of HIV, AIDS Research Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Group of Genomics and Pharmacogenomics of HIV, AIDS Research Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Immunopathology and Cellular Immunology, AIDS Research Group, Catalan project for the development of an HIV vaccine (HIVACAT), Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."

Here, we sought whether a similar population of CD8(+) T-regs would induce the suppression of HIV replication in elite controllers (ECs), a small population (3‰) of HIV-infected patients with undetectable HIV replication. For that purpose, we investigated the in vitro antiviral activity of fresh CD8(+) T-cells on HIV-infected CD4(+) T-cells taken from 10 ECs. The 10 ECs had a classical genomic profile: all of them carried the KIR3DL1 gene and 9 carried at least 1 allele of HLA-B:Bw4-80Ile (i.e., with an isoleucine residue at position 80). In the nine HLA-B:Bw4-80Ile-positive patients, we demonstrated a strong viral suppression by KIR3DL1-expressing CD8(+) T-cells that required cell-to-cell contact to switch off the activation signals in infected CD4(+) T-cells. KIR3DL1-expressing CD8(+) T-cells withdrawal and KIR3DL1 neutralization by a specific anti-killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) antibody inhibited the suppression of viral replication.

Additionally, samples from another nine elite controllers and nine viremic chronics were obtained. CD4 T-cell counts, viral load and immune activation were recorded. Natural killer (NK) cells and HIV-specific CTL quality were evaluated. Data were analyzed using nonparametric statistics. A male HIV elite controller was confirmed for CHIKV infection. At S1, he presented 211 cells/μl CD4 T-cell count, a HIV viral load blip (145 copies/ml) and high T-cell activation. NK cell percentage and activation were higher at S2. All parameters were recovered by S3. CTLs at S1 were exclusively monofunctional with a high proportion (>80%) of degranulating CTLs. By S3, CTL polyfunctionality was more similar to that of a typical elite controller. The distribution of CTL memory subsets also displayed altered profiles. The results showed that the phenotype and function of HIV-specific CTLs were modified in temporal association with an HIV viral load blip that followed CHIKV infection. This might have helped to control the transient HIV rebound. Additionally, NK cells could have been involved in this control. These results provide useful information to help understand how elite controllers maintain their status, control HIV infection and alert about the negative impact to the immune function of HIV-infected individuals living in CHIKV endemic areas.","2016","2016 Jul 31","Yanina Ghiglione; María Julia Ruiz; Jimena Salido; César Trifone; Omar Sued; Yamila Martin; Patricia Patterson; Natalia Laufer; Gabriela Turk","aInstituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y Sida INBIRS, Universidad de Buenos Aires - CONICET bHospital Juan A.

Despite a higher HIV burden in the ART group, compared with the EC group, frequencies of HIV-specific B cells were higher in the EC group, compared with those in the ART group. However, the initiation of ART in several ECs was associated with reduced frequencies of HIV-specific B cells, suggesting that responses are at least in part sustained by HIV replication. Furthermore, B-cell responses to tetanus toxin but not influenza hemagglutinin in the ART group were lower than those in the EC group.

These immunoregulatory cells have the capacity for rapid cytokine release after antigen recognition and are essential for the activation of multiple arms of the immune response. HIV-1 infection is associated with iNKT cell depletion in the peripheral blood; however, their role in the gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is less well studied. Our results show that iNKT cells are found at a higher frequency in GALT compared with blood, particularly in HIV-1 elite controllers. The capacity of iNKT cells to produce interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 in the GALT was associated with less immune activation and lower markers of microbial translocation, whereas regulatory T cell frequency showed positive associations with immune activation. We hypothesized that the composition of the microbiota would influence iNKT cell frequency and function. We found positive associations between the abundance of several Bacteroides species and iNKT cell frequency and their capacity to produce IL-4 in the GALT but not in the blood. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that GALT iNKT cells, influenced by certain bacterial species, may have a key role in regulating immune activation in HIV-1 infection.","2017","2017 Jan","D Paquin-Proulx; C Ching; I Vujkovic-Cvijin; D Fadrosh; L Loh; Y Huang; M Somsouk; S V Lynch; P W Hunt; D F Nixon; D SenGupta","Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Tropical Medicine, The George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.; Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, School of Pharmacy University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; HIV/AIDS Division, Department of Medicine, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Tropical Medicine, The George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.; Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA."

Soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2), as an IL-33 decoy receptor, contributes to limit inflammation. We assessed the relationship between the IL-33/ST2 axis and markers of gut mucosal damage in patients with early (EHI) and chronic HIV infection (CHI) and elite controllers. Analyses on patients with EHI and CHI were conducted to determine IL-33/sST2 changes over time. IL-33 and sST2 levels were measured in plasma. Correlations between sST2 levels and plasma viral load, CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts, expression of T-cell activation/exhaustion markers, gut mucosal damage, microbial translocation and inflammation markers, as well as kynurenine/tryptophan ratio were assessed. Plasma sST2 levels were elevated in EHI compared with untreated CHI and uninfected controls, whereas IL-33 levels were comparable in all groups. In EHI, sST2 levels were positively correlated with the CD8 T-cell count and the percentage of T cells expressing activation and exhaustion markers, but not with viral load or CD4 T-cell count. Plasma sST2 levels also correlated with plasma levels of gut mucosal damage, microbial translocation and kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and for some markers of inflammation. Prospective analyses showed that early antiretroviral therapy had no impact on sST2 levels, whereas longer treatment duration initiated during CHI normalized sST2. As sST2 levels were elevated in EHI and were correlated with CD8 T-cell count, immune activation, and microbial translocation, sST2 may serve as a marker of disease progression, gut damage and may directly contribute to HIV pathogenesis.","2016","2016 Jun 19","Vikram Mehraj; Mohammad-Ali Jenabian; Rosalie Ponte; Bertrand Lebouché; Cecilia Costiniuk; Réjean Thomas; Jean-Guy Baril; Roger LeBlanc; Joseph Cox; Cécile Tremblay; Jean-Pierre Routy; ","aResearch Institute of the McGill University Health CentrebChronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health CentrecDepartment of Biological Sciences and BioMed Research Centre, Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM)dDepartment of Family Medicine, McGill UniversityeClinique Médicale l'ActuelfClinique Médicale Quartier LatingClinique Médicale OPUShCentre de recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de MontréaliDépartement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Université de MontréaljDivision of Hematology, McGill University Health Centre, Montréal, Québec, Canada."

The goal of this study was to determine whether HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells are present in CSF of HIV controllers (HC), who maintain low to undetectable plasma viremia without antiretroviral therapy (ART). CSF and blood were sampled from 11 HC, defined based on plasma viral load (VL) consistently below 2,000 copies/ml without ART. These included nine elite controllers (EC, plasma VL <40 copies/ml) and two viremic controllers (VC, VL 40-2,000 copies/ml). All controllers had CSF VL <40 copies/ml. Three comparison groups were also sampled: six HIV noncontrollers (NC, VL >10,000 copies/ml, no ART); seven individuals with viremia suppressed due to ART (Tx, VL <40 copies/ml); and nine HIV-negative controls. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in CSF and blood were analyzed by flow cytometry to assess expression of CCR5, activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR, and memory/effector markers CD45RA and CCR7. HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells were quantified by major histocompatibility complex class I multimer staining. HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected ex vivo at similar frequencies in CSF of HC and noncontrollers; the highest frequencies were in individuals with CD4 counts below 500 cells/μl. The majority of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells in CSF were effector memory cells expressing CCR5. Detection of these cells in CSF suggests active surveillance of the CNS compartment by HIV-specific T cells, including in individuals with long-term control of HIV infection in the absence of therapy.","2016","2016 Aug","Anupama Ganesh; Donna Lemongello; Evelyn Lee; Julia Peterson; Bridget E McLaughlin; April L Ferre; Geraldine M Gillespie; Dietmar Fuchs; Steven G Deeks; Peter W Hunt; Richard W Price; Serena S Spudich; Barbara L Shacklett","1 Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California , Davis, Davis, California.; 1 Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California , Davis, Davis, California.; 2 Department of Neurology, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California , San Francisco, San Francisco, California.; 2 Department of Neurology, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California , San Francisco, San Francisco, California.; 1 Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California , Davis, Davis, California.; 1 Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California , Davis, Davis, California.; 3 Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford , Oxford, United Kingdom .; 4 Division of Biological Chemistry, Innsbruck Medical University , Innsbruck, Austria .; 5 Department of Medicine, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California , San Francisco, San Francisco, California.; 5 Department of Medicine, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California , San Francisco, San Francisco, California.; 2 Department of Neurology, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California , San Francisco, San Francisco, California.; 2 Department of Neurology, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California , San Francisco, San Francisco, California.; 1 Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California , Davis, Davis, California."

A multicenter cohort of HIV controllers was followed from baseline (the first of the three HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 in elite controller or from 50 to 2000 copies/ml in viremic controllers) up to August 2011, to the development of a progression event (loss of viral load control, CD4 decline, AIDS or death) or to the censoring date (lost to follow-up or initiation of antiretroviral therapy). Predictive models of progression at baseline and a risk score for the combined HIV-1 progression end point were calculated. Four hundred and seventy-five HIV-1 controllers of whom 204 (42.9%) were elite controller with 2972 person-years of follow-up were identified. One hundred and forty-one (29.7%) patients lost viral load control. CD4 cell count declined in 229 (48.2%) patients. Thirteen patients developed an AIDS event and four died. Two hundred and eighty-seven (60.4%) developed a combined HIV-1 progression. Baseline predictors for the progression end points and for elite and viremic controller patients were very similar: risk for HIV-1 acquisition, baseline calendar year, CD4 nadir, viral load before baseline and hepatitis C virus coinfection. The probability of a combined HIV-1 progression at 5 years was 70% for elite controllers with the highest score compared with 13% for those with the lowest. HIV-1 disease progression in elite and viremic controllers is frequent. We propose a baseline clinical score to easily classify these patients according to risk of progression.

Little is known about the long-term changes of T-cell subsets and inflammation patterns in ECs versus VCs. The aim of the study was to explore the long-term evolution of CD4(+) T-cell levels in LTNPs and to analyze cytokine profiles in ECs versus VCs. Nineteen ECs and 15 VCs were enrolled from the natural virus controller cohort (NaViC). T-cell counts were monitored over years, the mean annual change was calculated, and plasma concentrations of 25 cytokines were evaluated using a multiplex bead array. While absolute numbers of T cells did not differ between ECs and VCs over time, we observed a significant decrease of CD4(+) T-cell percentages in VCs, but not in ECs (median [interquartile range]: ECs: 37% [28-41] vs. VCs: 29% [25-34]; p = .02). ECs had lower levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β, p = .003), interferon γ-induced protein-10 (IP-10, p = .03), and monokine induced by interferon-γ (MIG, p = .02). CD4(+) T-cell percentages inversely correlated with MIP 1-β (r = -0.42, p = .017) and IP-10 (r = -0.77, p < .0001). A subtle decline of CD4(+) T-cell percentages could be observed in VCs, but not in ECs, which was associated with higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Hence, even low levels of HIV replication might go along with a progressive decline in CD4(+) T-cell counts in LTNPs.","2016","2016 Jun","Martin Platten; Norma Jung; Susanna Trapp; Pia Flossdorf; Dirk Meyer-Olson; Julian Schulze Zur Wiesch; Christoph Stephan; Stefan Mauss; Verena Weiss; Michael von Bergwelt-Baildon; Jürgen Rockstroh; Gerd Fätkenheuer; Clara Lehmann","1 Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Cologne , Cologne, Germany .; 2 German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) , partner site Bonn-Cologne, Cologne, Germany .; 1 Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Cologne , Cologne, Germany .; 3 Institute of Virology, University of Cologne , Cologne, Germany .; 4 Department of Neurology, University of Cologne , Cologne, Germany .; 5 Department of Internal Medicine and Rheumatology, m&i Specialty Hospital Bad Pyrmont , Bad Pyrmont, Germany .; 2 German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) , partner site Bonn-Cologne, Cologne, Germany .; 6 Infectious Disease Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf , Hamburg, Germany .; 7 J.

Because accumulating evidence suggests that HIV controllers generate antibodies with enhanced capacity to drive antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) that may contribute to viral containment, we profiled an array of extra-neutralizing antibody effector functions across HIV-infected populations with varying degrees of viral control to define the characteristics of antibodies associated with spontaneous control. While neither the overall magnitude of antibody titer nor individual effector functions were increased in ECs, a more functionally coordinated innate immune-recruiting response was observed. Specifically, ECs demonstrated polyfunctional humoral immune responses able to coordinately recruit ADCC, other NK functions, monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis, and complement. This functionally coordinated response was associated with qualitatively superior IgG3/IgG1 responses, whereas HIV-specific IgG2/IgG4 responses, prevalent among viremic subjects, were associated with poorer overall antibody activity. Rather than linking viral control to any single activity, this study highlights the critical nature of functionally coordinated antibodies in HIV control and associates this polyfunctionality with preferential induction of potent antibody subclasses, supporting coordinated antibody activity as a goal in strategies directed at an HIV-1 functional cure.","2016","2016 Jan","Margaret E Ackerman; Anastassia Mikhailova; Eric P Brown; Karen G Dowell; Bruce D Walker; Chris Bailey-Kellogg; Todd J Suscovich; Galit Alter","Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.; Department of Computer Science, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland, United States of America.; Department of Computer Science, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."

We report that effector CD8+ T cells during HIV infection in blood and SIV infection in lymphoid tissue exhibit higher levels of the negative checkpoint receptor TIGIT. Increased frequencies of TIGIT+ and TIGIT+ PD-1+ CD8+ T cells correlated with parameters of HIV and SIV disease progression. TIGIT remained elevated despite viral suppression in those with either pharmacological antiretroviral control or immunologically in elite controllers. HIV and SIV-specific CD8+ T cells were dysfunctional and expressed high levels of TIGIT and PD-1. Ex-vivo single or combinational antibody blockade of TIGIT and/or PD-L1 restored viral-specific CD8+ T cell effector responses. The frequency of TIGIT+ CD4+ T cells correlated with the CD4+ T cell total HIV DNA.

Elimination of HIV-1-infected cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) requires the presence of envelope glycoproteins (Env) in the CD4-bound conformation, raising the possibility that accumulating CD4 at the surface of virus-infected cells in EC could interact with Env and thereby sensitize these cells to ADCC. We observed a significant increase in the exposure of Env epitopes targeted by ADCC-mediating antibodies at the surface of cells expressing Nef isolates from EC; this correlated with enhanced susceptibility to ADCC. Altogether, our results suggest that enhanced susceptibility of HIV-1-infected cells to ADCC may contribute to the EC phenotype. Nef clones derived from elite controllers (EC) have been shown to be attenuated for CD4 downregulation; how this contributes to the nonprogressor phenotype of these infected individuals remains uncertain. Increasing evidence supports a role for HIV-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in controlling viral infection and replication. Here, we show that residual CD4 left at the surface of cells expressing Nef proteins isolated from ECs are sufficient to allow Env-CD4 interaction, leading to increased exposure of Env CD4-induced epitopes and increased susceptibility of infected cells to ADCC. Our results suggest that ADCC might be an active immune mechanism in EC that helps to maintain durable suppression of viral replication and low plasma viremia level in this rare subset of infected individuals. Therefore, targeting Nef's ability to downregulate CD4 could render HIV-1-infected cells susceptible to ADCC and thus have therapeutic utility.","2015","2015 Dec 30","Nirmin Alsahafi; Shilei Ding; Jonathan Richard; Tristan Markle; Nathalie Brassard; Bruce Walker; George K Lewis; Daniel E Kaufmann; Mark A Brockman; Andrés Finzi","Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Department of Microbiology and Immunology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Department of Microbiology, Infectiology, and Immunology, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Department of Microbiology, Infectiology, and Immunology, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA.; Institute of Human Virology and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA Department of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, La Jolla, California, USA.; Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Department of Microbiology, Infectiology, and Immunology, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Department of Microbiology and Immunology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada andres.finzi@umontreal.ca."

Chronic immune activation has detrimental consequences and thus ART has been advocated for all elite controllers. However, elite controllers are not a clinically homogenous group. Since CD4% is among the best predictors of AIDS-related events, in the current study, we assessed whether this marker can be used to stratify elite controllers needing ART. Sixteen elite controllers were divided into two groups based on CD4% (EC > 40% and EC ≤40%), and T-cell subsets were analyzed for markers of memory/differentiation (CD45RA, CCR7, CD28), activation (CD38/HLA-DR), immunosenescence (CD57), costimulation (CD73, CD28) and exhaustion (PD-1, CD160, Tim-3). Monocyte subsets (CD14, CD16) were also analyzed and sCD14 levels were quantified using ELISA. In the EC group, expression of activation, exhaustion, and immunosensescence markers on T cells were significantly reduced compared with the EC group and similar to the seronegative controls. The EC group expressed higher levels of costimulatory molecules CD28 and CD73 and had lower levels of monocyte activation (HLA-DR expression) with a reduced frequency of inflammatory monocyte (CD14 CD16) subset. Furthermore, the EC group maintained a stable CD4% during a median follow-up of 6 years. Elite controllers with preserved CD4T cells (EC) have normal T-cell and monocyte phenotypes and therefore may have limited benefit from ART. CD4% can be an important marker for evaluating future studies aimed at determining the need for ART in this group of individuals.","2015","2015 Nov","Anju Bansal; Sarah Sterrett; Nathan Erdmann; Andrew O Westfall; Jodie Dionne-Odom; Edgar T Overton; Paul A Goepfert","Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA."

The aim of this study was to determine whether IgA could modify the magnitude of ADCC in HIV infection, abrogating its protective role. Plasma samples from 20 HIV-positive (HIV(+)) subjects enrolled during primary HIV infection (PHI), 10 chronically infected subjects (chronic), and 7 elite controllers (EC) were used. ADCC was determined by using a fluorometric ADCC assay, before and after removal of plasma IgA. Data were analyzed by using nonparametric statistics. ADCC was documented in 80% of PHI enrollment samples and in 100% of PHI 12-month, chronic, and EC samples; it peaked after acute infection, reached a plateau in chronic infection, and decreased after initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART). Significant associations between ADCC and disease progression were found only after removal of plasma IgA from 12-month PHI samples: the magnitude of ADCC not only increased after IgA removal but also correlated with CD4(+) T-cell preservation. This work provides evidence that gp120-specific IgA was capable of modifying ADCC responses during natural HIV infection for the first time and adds to similar evidence provided in other settings. Furthermore, it underscores the complexity of the ADCC phenomenon and will help in an understanding of its underlying mechanisms. Although the induction of ADCC-mediating antibodies in HIV-infected subjects has been extensively documented, the association of these antibodies with protection from disease progression is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that plasma IgA is a factor capable of modifying the magnitude of IgG-mediated ADCC in HIV infection, mitigating its beneficial effect. These results help in understanding why previous studies failed to demonstrate correlations between ADCC and disease progression, and they also contribute to the notion that an HIV vaccine should stimulate the production of ADCC-mediating IgG antibodies but not IgA.","2016","2016 Jan 15","María Julia Ruiz; Yanina Ghiglione; Juliana Falivene; Natalia Laufer; María Pía Holgado; María Eugenia Socías; Pedro Cahn; Omar Sued; Luis Giavedoni; Horacio Salomón; María Magdalena Gherardi; Ana María Rodríguez; Gabriela Turk","Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), Universidad de Buenos Aires-CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina.; Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), Universidad de Buenos Aires-CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina.; Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), Universidad de Buenos Aires-CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina.; Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), Universidad de Buenos Aires-CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina Hospital J.

We hypothesized that changes of the gut microbiota predict immune dysfunction and HIV-1 progression, and that antiretroviral therapy (ART) partially restores the microbiota composition. An observational study including 28 viremic patients, three elite controllers, and nine uninfected controls. Blood and stool samples were collected at baseline and for 19 individuals at follow-up (median 10 months) during ART. Microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). Soluble markers of microbial translocation and monocyte activation were analyzed by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay or ELISA. Several alpha-diversity measures, including number of observed bacterial species and Shannon index, were significantly lower in viremic patients compared to controls. The alpha diversity correlated with CD4 T-cell counts and inversely with markers of microbial translocation and monocyte activation. In multivariate linear regression, for every age and sex-adjusted increase in the number of bacterial species, the CD4 T-cell count increased with 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.35-1.41) cells/μl (P = 0.002). After introduction of ART, microbiota alterations persisted with further reduction in alpha diversity. The microbiota composition at the genus level was profoundly altered in viremic patients, both at baseline and after ART, with Prevotella reduced during ART (P < 0.007). Gut microbiota alterations are closely associated with immune dysfunction in HIV-1 patients, and these changes persist during short-term ART. Our data implicate that re-shaping the microbiota may be an adjuvant therapy in patients commencing successful ART.","2015","2015 Nov 28","Piotr Nowak; Marius Troseid; Ekatarina Avershina; Babilonia Barqasho; Ujjwal Neogi; Kristian Holm; Johannes R Hov; Kajsa Noyan; Jan Vesterbacka; Jenny Svärd; Knut Rudi; Anders Sönnerborg","aDepartment of Medicine Huddinge, Unit of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden bDepartment of Infectious Diseases, Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål Hospital cK.G.

Likewise, Mamu-B*08 expression also predisposes rhesus macaques to control simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication. Given the similarities between Mamu-B*08 and HLA-B*27, SIV-infected Mamu-B*08(+) animals provide a model to investigate HLA-B*27-mediated elite control. We have recently shown that vaccination with three immunodominant Mamu-B*08-restricted epitopes (Vif RL8, Vif RL9, and Nef RL10) increased the incidence of elite control in Mamu-B*08(+) macaques after challenge with the pathogenic SIVmac239 clone. Furthermore, a correlate analysis revealed that CD8(+) T cells targeting Nef RL10 was correlated with improved outcome. Interestingly, this epitope is conserved between SIV and HIV-1 and exhibits a delayed and atypical escape pattern. These features led us to postulate that a monotypic vaccine-induced Nef RL10-specific CD8(+) T-cell response would facilitate the development of elite control in Mamu-B*08(+) animals following repeated intrarectal challenges with SIVmac239. To test this, we vaccinated Mamu-B*08(+) animals with nef inserts in which Nef RL10 was either left intact (group 1) or disrupted by mutations (group 2). Although monkeys in both groups mounted Nef-specific cellular responses, only those in group 1 developed Nef RL10-specific CD8(+) T cells. These vaccine-induced effector memory CD8(+) T cells did not prevent infection. Escape variants emerged rapidly in the group 1 vaccinees, and ultimately, the numbers of ECs were similar in groups 1 and 2. High-frequency vaccine-induced CD8(+) T cells focused on a single conserved epitope and therefore did not prevent infection or increase the incidence of elite control in Mamu-B*08(+) macaques. Since elite control of chronic-phase viremia is a classic example of an effective immune response against HIV/SIV, elucidating the basis of this phenomenon may provide useful insights into how to elicit such responses by vaccination. We have previously established that vaccine-induced CD8(+) T-cell responses against three immunodominant epitopes can increase the incidence of elite control in SIV-infected Mamu-B*08(+) rhesus macaques—a model of HLA-B*27-mediated elite control. Here, we investigated whether a monotypic vaccine-induced CD8(+) T-cell response targeting the conserved ""late-escaping"" Nef RL10 epitope can increase the incidence of elite control in Mamu-B*08(+) monkeys. Surprisingly, vaccine-induced Nef RL10-specific CD8(+) T cells selected for variants within days after infection and, ultimately, did not facilitate the development of elite control. Elite control is, therefore, likely to involve CD8(+) T-cell responses against more than one epitope. Together, these results underscore the complexity and multidimensional nature of virologic control of lentivirus infection.","2015","2015 Nov","Mauricio A Martins; Damien C Tully; Michael A Cruz; Karen A Power; Marlon G Veloso de Santana; David J Bean; Colin B Ogilvie; Rujuta Gadgil; Noemia S Lima; Diogo M Magnani; Keisuke Ejima; David B Allison; Michael Piatak; John D Altman; Christopher L Parks; Eva G Rakasz; Saverio Capuano; Ricardo Galler; Myrna C Bonaldo; Jeffrey D Lifson; Todd M Allen; David I Watkins","Department of Pathology, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA mmartins@med.miami.edu.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Pathology, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Pathology, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Laboratório de Biologia Molecular de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz-FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Department of Pathology, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA.; Section on Statistical Genetics, Department of Biostatistics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.; Section on Statistical Genetics, Department of Biostatistics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.; AIDS and Cancer Virus Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory, Frederick, Maryland, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.; International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, AIDS Vaccine Design and Development Laboratory, Brooklyn Army Terminal, Brooklyn, New York, USA.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Instituto de Tecnologia em Imunobiológicos, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Laboratório de Biologia Molecular de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz-FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; AIDS and Cancer Virus Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory, Frederick, Maryland, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Pathology, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA."

Here, we interrogated the in vivo relevance of this cell population by investigating whether the breadth of expandable memory responses is associated with the magnitude of residual viremia in individuals achieving durable suppression of HIV infection. HIV-specific memory CD8(+) T cells were expanded by using autologous epitopic and variant peptides. Viral load was measured by an ultrasensitive single-copy PCR assay. Following expansion, controllers showed a greater increase in the overall breadth of Gag responses than did untreated progressors (P = 0.01) as well as treated progressors (P = 0.0003). Nef- and Env-specific memory cells expanded poorly for all groups, and their expanded breadths were indistinguishable among groups (P = 0.9 for Nef as determined by a Kruskal-Wallis test; P = 0.6 for Env as determined by a Kruskal-Wallis test). More importantly, we show that the breadth of expandable, previously undetectable Gag-specific responses was inversely correlated with residual viral load (r = -0.6; P = 0.009). Together, these data reveal a direct link between the abundance of Gag-specific expandable memory responses and prolonged maintenance of low-level viremia. Our studies highlight a CD8(+) T cell feature that would be desirable in a vaccine-induced T cell response. Many studies have shown that the rare ability of some individuals to control HIV infection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy appears to be heavily dependent upon special HIV-specific killer T lymphocytes that are able to inhibit viral replication. The identification of key features of these immune cells has the potential to inform rational HIV vaccine design. This study shows that a special subset of killer lymphocytes, known as central memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes, is at least partially involved in the durable control of HIV replication. HIV controllers maintain a large proportion of Gag-specific expandable memory CD8(+) T cells involved in ongoing viral suppression. These data suggest that induction of this cell subset by future HIV vaccines may be important for narrowing possible routes of rapid escape from vaccine-induced CD8(+) T cell responses.","2015","2015 Nov","Zaza M Ndhlovu; Eleni Stampouloglou; Kevin Cesa; Orestes Mavrothalassitis; Donna Marie Alvino; Jonathan Z Li; Shannon Wilton; Daniel Karel; Alicja Piechocka-Trocha; Huabiao Chen; Florencia Pereyra; Bruce D Walker","Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, Nelson R.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes and microvesicles released by several cell types may contribute to immune activation and dysfunction. EV size, abundance, and content appear to differ according to infection phase, disease progression, and ART. We examined whether the size of EVs and the abundance of exosomes in plasma are associated with cell and tissue activation as well as with viral production. Acetylcholinesterase-bearing (AChE+) exosomes in plasma were quantified using an AChE assay. EV size was analyzed using dynamic light scattering. Proteins and microRNAs present in EVs were detected by Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Exosomes were found more abundant in the plasma of ART-naive patients. EV size was larger in ART-naive than in ART-suppressed patients, elite controllers, or healthy control subjects. Both exosome abundance and EV sizes were inversely correlated with CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio and neutrophil, platelet, and CD4 T-cell counts and positively correlated with CD8 T-cell counts. A negative correlation was found between CD4 T-cell nadir and exosome abundance, but not EV size. Levels of miR-155 and miR-223 but not miR-92 were strongly correlated negatively with EV abundance and size in ART-naive patients. Monitoring of circulating EVs and EV-borne microRNA is possible and may provide new insight into HIV-1 pathogenesis, disease progression, and the associated inflammatory state, as well as the efficacy of ART and the treatments intended to reduce immune activation.","2015","2015 Nov 01","Audrey Hubert; Caroline Subra; Mohammad-Ali Jenabian; Pierre-François Tremblay Labrecque; Cécile Tremblay; Benoit Laffont; Patrick Provost; Jean-Pierre Routy; Caroline Gilbert","*Centre de recherche du CHU de Québec and Faculty of Medicine, Département de microbiologie infectiologie et immunologie, Université Laval, Québec, Québec, Canada; †Département des Sciences Biologiques et Centre de recherche BioMed, Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), Montréal, Québec, Canada; ‡Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Département de microbiologie infectiologie et immunologie, Montréal, Québec, Canada; and §Chronic Viral Illness Service and Research Institute, McGill University Health Centre, Montréal, Québec, Canada."

Nef sequence motifs that modulate these functions have been identified via in vitro mutagenesis with laboratory HIV-1 strains. However, it remains unclear whether the same motifs contribute to Nef activity in patient-derived sequences and whether these motifs may differ in Nef sequences isolated at different infection stages and/or from patients with different disease phenotypes. Here, nef clones from 45 elite controllers (EC), 46 chronic progressors (CP), and 43 acute progressors (AP) were examined for their CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 downregulation functions. Nef clones from EC exhibited statistically significantly impaired CD4 and CCR5 downregulation ability and modestly impaired CXCR4 downregulation activity compared to those from CP and AP. Nef's ability to downregulate CD4 and CCR5 correlated positively in all cohorts, suggesting that they are functionally linked in vivo. Moreover, impairments in Nef's receptor downregulation functions increased the susceptibility of Nef-expressing cells to HIV-1 infection. Mutagenesis studies on three functionally impaired EC Nef clones revealed that multiple residues, including those at novel sites, were involved in the alteration of Nef functions and steady-state protein levels. Specifically, polymorphisms at highly conserved tryptophan residues (e.g., Trp-57 and Trp-183) and immune escape-associated sites were responsible for reduced Nef functions in these clones. Our results suggest that the functional modulation of primary Nef sequences is mediated by complex polymorphism networks. HIV-1 Nef, a key factor for viral pathogenesis, downregulates functionally important molecules from the surface of infected cells, including the viral entry receptor CD4 and coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4. This activity enhances viral replication by protecting infected cells from cytotoxicity associated with superinfection and may also serve as an immune evasion strategy. However, how these activities are maintained under selective pressure in vivo remains elusive. We addressed this question by analyzing functions of primary Nef clones isolated from patients at various infection stages and with different disease phenotypes, including elite controllers, who spontaneously control HIV-1 viremia to undetectable levels. The results indicated that downregulation of HIV-1 entry receptors, particularly CCR5, is impaired in Nef clones from elite controllers. These functional impairments were driven by rare Nef polymorphisms and adaptations associated with cellular immune responses, underscoring the complex molecular pathways responsible for maintaining and attenuating viral protein function in vivo.","2015","2015 Sep","Mako Toyoda; Yoko Ogata; Macdonald Mahiti; Yosuke Maeda; Xiaomei T Kuang; Toshiyuki Miura; Heiko Jessen; Bruce D Walker; Mark A Brockman; Zabrina L Brumme; Takamasa Ueno","Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.; Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.; Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.; Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.; Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.; University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Jessen Praxis, Berlin, Germany.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA.; Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan uenotaka@kumamoto-u.ac.jp."

Durable control in LTNP/EC is likely mediated by highly functional virus-specific CD8(+) T-cells. Protective Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I alleles, like B*27 and B*57, are present in most, but not all LTNP/EC, providing an opportunity to investigate features shared by their HIV-specific immune responses. To better understand the contribution of epitope targeting and conservation to immune control, we compared the CD8(+) T-cell specificity and function of B*27/57(neg) LTNP/EC (n = 23), B*27/57(pos) LTNP/EC (n = 23) and B*27/57(neg) progressors (n = 13). Fine mapping revealed 11 previously unreported immunodominant responses. Although B*27/57(neg) LTNP/EC did not target more highly conserved epitopes, their CD8(+) T-cell cytotoxic capacity was significantly higher than progressors. Similar to B*27/57(pos) LTNP/EC, this superior cytotoxicity was mediated by preferential expansion of immunodominant responses and lysis through the predicted HLA. These findings suggest that increased CD8(+) T-cell cytotoxic capacity is a common mechanism of control in most LTNP/EC regardless of HLA type. They also suggest that potent cytotoxicity can be mediated through various epitopes and HLA molecules and could, in theory, be induced in most people.","2015","2015 Jan","Stephen A Migueles; Daniel Mendoza; Matthew G Zimmerman; Kelly M Martins; Sushila A Toulmin; Elizabeth P Kelly; Bennett A Peterson; Sarah A Johnson; Eric Galson; Kate O Poropatich; Andy Patamawenu; Hiromi Imamichi; Alexander Ober; Catherine A Rehm; Sara Jones; Claire W Hallahan; Dean A Follmann; Mark Connors","Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Clinical Monitoring Research Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick, MD, USA.; Biostatistics Research Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Biostatistics Research Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."

In recent longitudinal studies involving HIV-1-infected individuals with different rates of disease progression, we have shown that DCs were altered in number and phenotype in the context of HIV-1 disease progression and B-cell dysregulations were associated with increased BLyS/BAFF expression in plasma and by blood myeloid DCs (mDCs) in rapid and classic progressors but not in HIV-1-elite controllers (EC). Suggesting that the extent to which HIV-1 disease progression is controlled may be linked to BLyS/BAFF expression status and the capacity to orchestrate B-cell responses. Herein, longitudinal analyses of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques also revealed increased expression of BLyS/BAFF by blood mDCs as soon as day 8 and throughout infection. Strikingly, granulocytes presented the highest BLyS/BAFF expression profile in the blood of SIV-infected macaques. BLyS/BAFF levels were also increased in plasma and correlated with viral loads. Consequently, these SIV-infected animals had plasma hyperglobulinemia and reduced blood B-cell numbers with altered population frequencies. These data underscore that BLyS/BAFF is associated with immune dysregulation in SIV-infected rhesus macaques and suggest that BLyS/BAFF is a key regulator of immune activation that is highly conserved among primates. These findings emphasize the potential importance of this SIV-infected primate model to test whether blocking excess BLyS/BAFF has an effect on the overall inflammatory burden and immune restoration.","2015","2015","Johanne Poudrier; Caroline Soulas; Josiane Chagnon-Choquet; Tricia Burdo; Patrick Autissier; Kathryn Oskar; Kenneth C Williams; Michel Roger","Laboratoire d'immunogénétique, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada; Département de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Boston College, Boston, MA, United States of America.; Laboratoire d'immunogénétique, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada; Département de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Boston College, Boston, MA, United States of America.; Boston College, Boston, MA, United States of America.; Boston College, Boston, MA, United States of America.; Boston College, Boston, MA, United States of America.; Laboratoire d'immunogénétique, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada; Département de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada."

Cytosolic immune recognition of HIV-1 in conventional dendritic cells (cDC) can facilitate priming and expansion of HIV-1-specific T cells; however, HIV-1 seems to be able to avoid intracellular immune recognition in cDCs in most infected individuals. Here, we show that exposure of cDCs from EC to HIV-1 leads to a rapid and sustained production of type I interferons and upregulation of several interferon-stimulated effector genes. Emergence of these cell-intrinsic immune responses was associated with a reduced induction of SAMHD1 and LEDGF/p75, and an accumulation of viral reverse transcripts, but inhibited by pharmacological blockade of viral reverse transcription or siRNA-mediated silencing of the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS. Importantly, improved cell-intrinsic immune recognition of HIV-1 in cDCs from elite controllers translated into stronger abilities to stimulate and expand HIV-1-specific CD8 T cell responses. These data suggest an important role of cell-intrinsic type I interferon secretion in dendritic cells for the induction of effective HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells, and may be helpful for eliciting functional T cell immunity against HIV-1 for preventative or therapeutic clinical purposes.","2015","2015 Jun","Enrique Martin-Gayo; Maria Jose Buzon; Zhengyu Ouyang; Taylor Hickman; Jacqueline Cronin; Dina Pimenova; Bruce D Walker; Mathias Lichterfeld; Xu G Yu","Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Infectious Disease Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Infectious Disease Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Infectious Disease Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."

The study duration was 48 weeks, however, vaccinees were followed until the last enrolled subject reached the 48 weeks. Reported are final data up to 144 weeks of follow-up. The ISS T-002 trial was conducted in 11 clinical centers in Italy on 168 HIV positive subjects under Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), anti-Tat Antibody (Ab) negative at baseline, with plasma viremia <50 copies/mL in the last 6 months prior to enrollment, and CD4(+) T-cell number ≥200 cells/μL. Subjects from a parallel observational study (ISS OBS T-002, Clinicaltrials.gov NCT0102455) enrolled at the same clinical sites with the same criteria constituted an external reference group to explore biomarkers of disease. The vaccine was safe and well tolerated and induced anti-Tat Abs in most patients (79%), with the highest frequency and durability in the Tat 30 μg groups (89%) particularly when given 3 times (92%). Vaccination promoted a durable and significant restoration of T, B, natural killer (NK) cells, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) central memory subsets. Moreover, a significant reduction of blood proviral DNA was seen after week 72, particularly under PI-based regimens and with Tat 30 μg given 3 times (30 μg, 3x), reaching a predicted 70% decay after 3 years from vaccination with a half-life of 88 weeks. This decay was significantly associated with anti-Tat IgM and IgG Abs and neutralization of Tat-mediated entry of oligomeric Env in dendritic cells, which predicted HIV-1 DNA decay. Finally, the 30 μg, 3x group was the only one showing significant increases of NK cells and CD38(+)HLA-DR(+)/CD8(+) T cells, a phenotype associated with increased killing activity in elite controllers. Anti-Tat immune responses are needed to restore immune homeostasis and effective anti-viral responses capable of attacking the virus reservoir. Thus, Tat immunization represents a promising pathogenesis-driven intervention to intensify HAART efficacy.","2015","2015 Apr 29","Fabrizio Ensoli; Aurelio Cafaro; Anna Casabianca; Antonella Tripiciano; Stefania Bellino; Olimpia Longo; Vittorio Francavilla; Orietta Picconi; Cecilia Sgadari; Sonia Moretti; Maria R Pavone Cossut; Angela Arancio; Chiara Orlandi; Leonardo Sernicola; Maria T Maggiorella; Giovanni Paniccia; Cristina Mussini; Adriano Lazzarin; Laura Sighinolfi; Guido Palamara; Andrea Gori; Gioacchino Angarano; Massimo Di Pietro; Massimo Galli; Vito S Mercurio; Francesco Castelli; Giovanni Di Perri; Paolo Monini; Mauro Magnani; Enrico Garaci; Barbara Ensoli","Pathology and Microbiology, San Gallicano Institute, Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri, Rome, Italy. ensoli@ifo.it.; National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, 00161, Italy. aurelio.cafaro@iss.it.; Department of Biomolecular Science, University of Urbino, Urbino, Italy. anna.casabianca@uniurb.it.; Pathology and Microbiology, San Gallicano Institute, Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri, Rome, Italy. tripiciano@ifo.it.; National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, 00161, Italy. tripiciano@ifo.it.; National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, 00161, Italy. stefania.bellino@iss.it.; National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, 00161, Italy. olimpia.longo@iss.it.; Pathology and Microbiology, San Gallicano Institute, Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri, Rome, Italy. francavilla@ifo.it.; National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, 00161, Italy. francavilla@ifo.it.; National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, 00161, Italy. orietta.picconi@iss.it.; National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, 00161, Italy. cecilia.sgadari@iss.it.; National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, 00161, Italy. sonia.moretti@iss.it.; National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, 00161, Italy. mariarosaria.pavonecossut@iss.it.; Pathology and Microbiology, San Gallicano Institute, Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri, Rome, Italy. arancio@ifo.it.; National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, 00161, Italy. arancio@ifo.it.; Department of Biomolecular Science, University of Urbino, Urbino, Italy. chiara.orlandi@uniurb.it.; National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, 00161, Italy. leonardo.sernicola@iss.it.; National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, 00161, Italy. mariateresa.maggiorella@iss.it.; Pathology and Microbiology, San Gallicano Institute, Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri, Rome, Italy. paniccia@ifo.it.; National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, 00161, Italy. paniccia@ifo.it.; Division of Infectious Diseases, University Policlinic of Modena, Modena, Italy. crimuss@unimore.it.; Division of Infectious Diseases, S.

Methods.  Twenty inflammatory markers measured in cohorts of ECs, HIV suppressed noncontrollers, and HIV-uninfected controls were compared using rank-based tests and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA). Spearman correlations were determined among the inflammatory markers, residual viremia by the single-copy assay, and CD4(+) T cell slope. Results.  Significant differences were seen between cohorts in 15 of the soluble inflammatory markers. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 ECs were found to have the highest levels for all of the markers with the exception of RANTES. In particular, median levels of 7 inflammatory markers (soluble CD14 [sCD14], interferon [IFN]-γ, IFN-γ-inducible protein [IP]-10, interleukin [IL]-4, IL-10, sCD40L, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) were twice as high in the HIV-1 ECs compared with either of the HIV-suppressed or uninfected groups. Multivariate PLSDA analysis of inflammatory markers improved differentiation between the patient cohorts, discerning gender differences in inflammatory profile amongst individuals on suppressive ART. Soluble markers of inflammation in ECs were not associated with either levels of residual HIV-1 viremia or CD4(+) T cell decline. Conclusions.  Despite maintaining relatively low levels of viremia, HIV-1 ECs had elevated levels of a set of key inflammatory markers. Additional studies are needed to determine whether ECs may benefit from ART and to further evaluate the observed gender differences.","2015","2015 Jan","Jonathan Z Li; Kelly B Arnold; Janet Lo; Anne-Sophie Dugast; Jill Plants; Heather J Ribaudo; Kevin Cesa; Andrea Heisey; Daniel R Kuritzkes; Douglas A Lauffenburger; Galit Alter; Alan Landay; Steven Grinspoon; Florencia Pereyra","Brigham and Women's Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge.; Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard , Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Rush University Medical Center , Chicago, Illinois.; Harvard School of Public Health , Boston, Massachusetts.; Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston.; Brigham and Women's Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Brigham and Women's Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard , Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Rush University Medical Center , Chicago, Illinois.; Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston.; Brigham and Women's Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Cambridge, Massachusetts ; Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston."

The gold standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) underestimates the magnitude of the viral reservoir. We sought to determine whether xenograft of leukocytes from HIV type 1 (HIV)-infected patients with undetectable plasma viral loads into immunocompromised mice would result in viral amplification. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells or purified CD4(+) T cells from HIV or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected subjects with undetectable plasma viral loads were adoptively transferred into NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ (NSG) mice. The mice were monitored for viremia following depletion of human CD8(+) T cells to minimize antiviral activity. In some cases, humanized mice were also treated with activating anti-CD3 antibody. With this murine viral outgrowth assay (MVOA), we successfully amplified replication-competent HIV or SIV from all subjects tested, including 5 HIV-positive patients receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 6 elite controllers or suppressors who were maintaining undetectable viral loads without ART, including an elite suppressor from whom we were unable to recover virus by QVOA.

Here we assessed coexpression of PD-1, Lag-3, CD160, and 2B4 as a measure of T-cell exhaustion in a cohort of elite controllers and in chronic progressors. We found that elite controllers have a high proportion of potentially exhausted (PD1(+)CD160(+)2B4(+)) HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells that is comparable to the proportion in chronic progressors. However, elite controllers also harbor a population of HIV-specific CD160(+)2B4(+) CD8(+) T cells that correlates with cytolytic capacity, as measured by perforin expression, a population not commonly present in chronic progressors.

We investigate the hypothesis that ART initiated early during primary infection permits PTC by limiting the size of the latent reservoir, which, if small enough at treatment termination, may allow the adaptive immune response to prevent viral rebound (VR) and control infection. We use a mathematical model of within host HIV dynamics to capture interactions among target cells, productively infected cells, latently infected cells, virus, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Analysis of our model reveals a range in CTL response strengths where a patient may show either VR or PTC, depending on the size of the latent reservoir at treatment termination. Below this range, patients will always rebound, whereas above this range, patients are predicted to behave like elite controllers.

In rare cases, however, patients spontaneously control HIV-1 replication. Mechanisms by which such elite controllers (ECs) achieve control of HIV-1 replication include particularly efficient immune responses as well as reduced fitness of the specific virus strains. To address whether polymorphisms in the accessory HIV-1 protein Vpu are associated with EC status we functionally analyzed a panel of plasma-derived vpu alleles from 15 EC and 16 chronic progressor (CP) patients. Antagonism of the HIV particle release restriction by the intrinsic immunity factor CD317/tetherin was well conserved among EC and CP Vpu alleles, underscoring the selective advantage of this Vpu function in HIV-1 infected individuals. In contrast, interference with CD317/tetherin induced NF-κB activation was little conserved in both groups. EC Vpus more frequently displayed reduced ability to downregulate cell surface levels of CD4 and MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules as well as of the NK cell ligand NTB-A. Polymorphisms potentially associated with high affinity interactions of the inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) KIR2DL2 were significantly enriched among EC Vpus but did not account for these functional differences. Together these results suggest that in a subgroup of EC patients, some Vpu functions are modestly reduced, possibly as a result of host selection.","2015","2015","Jingyan Chen; Nadine Tibroni; Daniel Sauter; Johanna Galaski; Toshiyuki Miura; Galit Alter; Birthe Mueller; Claudia Haller; Bruce D Walker; Frank Kirchhoff; Zabrina L Brumme; Takamasa Ueno; Oliver T Fackler","Department of Infectious Diseases, Integrative Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, INF 324, Heidelberg, Germany; German Center for Infection Research, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg.

However, the causes of resistance to HIV-1 infection in cases other than those with a homozygous CCR5Δ32 deletion are unclear. We hypothesized that human p21WAF1/CIP1 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) could play a role in resistance to HIV-1 infection in HESN, as p21 expression has been associated with suppression of HIV-1 in elite controllers and reported to block HIV-1 integration in cell culture.

Comparing the 20 HESN with the highest exposure risk (median = 111 partners/2.5 years prior to the 20 LESC with the lowest exposure risk (median = 1 partner/2.5 years prior), p21 expression trended higher in HESN in only one of two experiments (P = 0.11 vs. P = 0.80). Additionally, comparison of p21 expression in the top 40 HESN (median = 73 partners/year) and lowest 40 LESC (median = 2 partners/year) showed no difference between the groups (P = 0.84). There was a weak linear trend between risk of infection after exposure and increasing p21 gene expression (R2 = 0.02, P = 0.12), but again only in one experiment. Hence, if p21 expression contributes to the resistance to viral infection in HESN, it likely plays a minor role evident only in those with extremely high levels of exposure to HIV-1.","2015","2015","Joshua Herbeck; Suvankar Ghorai; Lennie Chen; Charles R Rinaldo; Joseph B Margolick; Roger Detels; Lisa Jacobson; Steven Wolinsky; James I Mullins","Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.; Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.; Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.; University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.; Department of Epidemiology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.; Department of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.; Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America."

The mechanisms responsible for this phenotype, however, have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we examined CD4(+) T cell resistance to HIV in a cohort of elite controllers and explored transcriptional signatures associated with cellular resistance. We demonstrate that a subgroup of elite controllers possess CD4(+) T cells that are specifically resistant to R5-tropic HIV while remaining fully susceptible to X4-tropic and vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G)-pseudotyped viruses. Transcriptome analysis revealed 17 genes that were differentially regulated in resistant elite controllers relative to healthy controls. Notably, the genes encoding macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α), CCL3 and CCL3L1, were found to be upregulated. The MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES chemokines are natural ligands of CCR5 and are known to interfere with HIV replication. For three elite controllers, we observed increased production of MIP-1α and/or MIP-1β at the protein level. The supernatant from resistant EC cells contained MIP-1α and MIP-1β and was sufficient to confer R5-tropic resistance to susceptible CD4(+) T cells. Additionally, this effect was reversed by using inhibitory anti-MIP antibodies. These results suggest that the T cells of these particular elite controllers may be naturally resistant to HIV infection by blocking R5-tropic viral entry. HIV is a pandemic health problem, and the majority of seropositive individuals will eventually progress to AIDS unless antiretroviral therapy (ART) is administered. However, rare patients, termed elite controllers, have a natural ability to control HIV infection in the absence of ART, but the mechanisms by which they achieve this phenotype have not been fully explored. This paper identifies one mechanism that may contribute to this natural resistance: some elite controllers have CD4(+) T cells that produce high levels of MIP chemokines, which block R5-tropic HIV entry. This mechanism could potentially be exploited to achieve a therapeutic effect in other HIV-seropositive individuals.","2015","2015 May","Wendy E Walker; Sebastian Kurscheid; Samit Joshi; Charlie A Lopez; Gerald Goh; Murim Choi; Lydia Barakat; John Francis; Ann Fisher; Michael Kozal; Heidi Zapata; Albert Shaw; Richard Lifton; Richard E Sutton; Erol Fikrig","Center of Excellence in Infectious Diseases, Department of Biomedical Sciences, TTUHSC El Paso, El Paso, Texas, USA Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Center of Excellence in Infectious Diseases, Department of Biomedical Sciences, TTUHSC El Paso, El Paso, Texas, USA.; Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA richard.sutton@yale.edu.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven, Connecticut, USA."

Functional attenuation of some HIV-1 proteins has been reported in EC. The HIV-1 accessory protein Vif (virion infectivity factor) enhances viral infectivity through anti-retroviral factor apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) degradation; however, little is known regarding Vif function in EC. Here, the anti-APOBEC3G activities of clonal, plasma HIV RNA-derived Vif sequences from 46 EC, 46 noncontrollers (NC), and 44 individuals with acute infection (AI) were compared. Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped viruses were generated by cotransfecting 293T cells with expression plasmids encoding patient-derived Vif, human APOBEC3G, VSV-G, and a vif/env-deficient luciferase-reporter HIV-1 proviral DNA clone. Viral stocks were used to infect 293T cells, and Vif anti-APOBEC3G activity was quantified in terms of luciferase signal. On average, the anti-APOBEC3G activities of EC-derived Vif sequences (median log10 relative light units [RLU], 4.54 [interquartile range {IQR}, 4.30 to 4.66]) were significantly lower than those of sequences derived from NC (4.75 [4.60 to 4.92], P < 0.0001) and AI (4.74 [4.62 to 4.94], P < 0.0001). Reduced Vif activities were not associated with particular HLA class I alleles expressed by the host. Vif functional motifs were highly conserved in all patient groups. No single viral polymorphism could explain the reduced anti-APOBEC3G activity of EC-derived Vif, suggesting that various combinations of minor polymorphisms may underlie these effects. These results further support the idea of relative attenuation of viral protein function in EC-derived HIV sequences. HIV-1 elite controllers (EC) are rare individuals who are able to control plasma viremia to undetectable levels without antiretroviral therapy. Understanding the pathogenesis and mechanisms underpinning this rare phenotype may provide important insights for HIV vaccine design. The EC phenotype is associated with beneficial host immunogenetic factors (such as HLA-B*57) as well as with functions of attenuated viral proteins (e.g., Gag, Pol, and Nef). In this study, we demonstrated that HIV-1 Vif sequences isolated from EC display relative impairments in their ability to counteract the APOBEC3G host restriction factor compared to Vif sequences from normal progressors and acutely infected individuals. This result extends the growing body of evidence demonstrating attenuated HIV-1 protein function in EC and, in particular, supports the idea of the relevance of viral factors in contributing to this rare HIV-1 phenotype.","2015","2015 May","Tadashi Kikuchi; Yukie Iwabu; Takuya Tada; Ai Kawana-Tachikawa; Michiko Koga; Noriaki Hosoya; Shigeru Nomura; Zabrina L Brumme; Heiko Jessen; Florencia Pereyra; Alicja Trocha; Bruce D Walker; Aikichi Iwamoto; Kenzo Tokunaga; Toshiyuki Miura","The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.; National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.; The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Praxis Jessen2+Kollegen, Berlin, Germany.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan tokunaga@nih.go.jp toshiyuki.miura@gmail.com.; The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan tokunaga@nih.go.jp toshiyuki.miura@gmail.com."

Like many other receptors, a soluble form of this protein has been described in human blood plasma. However, soluble Tim-3 (sTim-3) is poorly characterized, and its role in HIV disease is unknown. Here, we show that Tim-3 is shed from the surface of responding CD8(+) T cells by the matrix metalloproteinase ADAM10, producing a soluble form of the coinhibitory receptor. Despite previous reports in the mouse model, no alternatively spliced, soluble form of Tim-3 was observed in humans. Shed sTim-3 was found in human plasma and was significantly elevated during early and chronic untreated HIV infection, but it was not found differentially modulated in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-treated HIV-infected subjects or in elite controllers compared to HIV-uninfected subjects. Plasma sTim-3 levels were positively correlated with HIV load and negatively correlated with CD4 counts. Thus, plasma sTim-3 shedding correlated with HIV disease progression. Despite these correlations, we found that shedding Tim-3 did not improve the function of CD8(+) T cells in terms of gamma interferon production or prevent their apoptosis through galectin-9. Further characterization studies of sTim-3 function are needed to understand the contribution of sTim-3 in HIV disease pathogenesis, with implications for novel therapeutic interventions. Despite the overall success of HAART in slowing the progression to AIDS in HIV-infected subjects, chronic immune activation and T cell exhaustion contribute to the eventual deterioration of the immune system. Understanding these processes will aid in the development of interventions and therapeutics to be used in combination with HAART to slow or reverse this deterioration. Here, we show that a soluble form of T cell exhaustion associated coinhibitory molecule 3, sTim-3, is shed from the surface of T cells. Furthermore, sTim-3 is elevated in the plasma of treatment-naive subjects with acute or chronic HIV infection and is associated with markers of disease progression. This is the first study to characterize sTim-3 in human plasma, its source, and mechanism of production. While it is still unclear whether sTim-3 contributes to HIV pathogenesis, sTim-3 may represent a new correlate of HIV disease progression.","2015","2015 Apr","Kiera L Clayton; Matthew B Douglas-Vail; A K M Nur-ur Rahman; Karyn E Medcalf; Irene Y Xie; Glen M Chew; Ravi Tandon; Marion C Lanteri; Philip J Norris; Steven G Deeks; Lishomwa C Ndhlovu; Mario A Ostrowski","Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada kiera.clayton@gmail.com mario.ostrowski@gmail.com.; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Hawaii Center for AIDS, Department of Tropical Medicine, University of Hawaii, John A.

Here we show that productive SIV infection in rhesus monkey ECs, but not TPs, is markedly restricted to CD4(+) follicular helper T (TFH) cells, suggesting that these EC monkeys' highly effective SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells can effectively clear productive SIV infection from extrafollicular sites, but their relative exclusion from B cell follicles prevents their elimination of productively infected TFH cells. CD8(+) lymphocyte depletion in EC monkeys resulted in a dramatic re-distribution of productive SIV infection to non-TFH cells, with restriction of productive infection to TFH cells resuming upon CD8(+) T cell recovery. Thus, B cell follicles constitute 'sanctuaries' for persistent SIV replication in the presence of potent anti-viral CD8(+) T cell responses, potentially complicating efforts to cure HIV infection with therapeutic vaccination or T cell immunotherapy.","2015","2015 Feb","Yoshinori Fukazawa; Richard Lum; Afam A Okoye; Haesun Park; Kenta Matsuda; Jin Young Bae; Shoko I Hagen; Rebecca Shoemaker; Claire Deleage; Carissa Lucero; David Morcock; Tonya Swanson; Alfred W Legasse; Michael K Axthelm; Joseph Hesselgesser; Romas Geleziunas; Vanessa M Hirsch; Paul T Edlefsen; Michael Piatak; Jacob D Estes; Jeffrey D Lifson; Louis J Picker","1] Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute, Oregon Health &Science University, Beaverton, Oregon, USA.

This protein is constitutively expressed and secreted by HIV-1 resistant CD4(+) T cells and its mRNA transcription is up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-1 elite controllers. The secreted/soluble X-DING-CD4 protein form is of particular importance because it blocks virus transcription when added to HIV-1 susceptible cells. The present study aimed to determine the contribution of this factor to the induction of the antiviral response in target cells. We found that soluble X-DING-CD4 enters cells by endocytosis and that influx of this protein induced transcription of interferon-α and endogenous X-DING-CD4 mRNA in transformed CD4(+) T cells and primary macrophages. Treatment of HIV-1 susceptible cells with exogenous X-DING-CD4 caused depletion of phosphorylated p50 and p65 nuclear factor kappa β subunits and a significant reduction in p50/p65 nuclear factor kappa β binding to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. Taken together, these findings indicate a novel antiviral mechanism mediated by the influx of soluble X-DING-CD4, its signaling to promote self-amplification, and functional duality as an endogenous innate immunity effector and exogenous factor regulating gene expression in bystander cells.","2015","2015 Mar","Rakhee Sachdeva; Yuchang Li; Rasheda Y Shilpi; Malgorzata Simm","Protein Chemistry Laboratory, St Luke's/Roosevelt Institute for Health Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."

EC displayed a weaker Gag/Nef IFN-γ T-cell response and a significantly lower proportion of anti-HIV IgG antibodies than EEC, VC, and NC groups.

Using a cross-sectional design and archived samples, we compared concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neuronal biomarkers in 143 samples from 8 HIV-infected subject groups representing a spectrum of untreated systemic HIV progression and viral suppression: primary infection; four groups of chronic HIV infection neuroasymptomatic (NA) subjects defined by blood CD4+ T cells of >350, 200-349, 50-199, and <50 cells/µL; HAD; treatment-induced viral suppression; and 'elite' controllers. Samples from 20 HIV-uninfected controls were also examined. The neuronal biomarkers included neurofilament light chain protein (NFL), total and phosphorylated tau (t-tau, p-tau), soluble amyloid precursor proteins alpha and beta (sAPPα, sAPPβ) and amyloid beta (Aβ) fragments 1-42, 1-40 and 1-38. Comparison of the biomarker changes showed a hierarchy of sensitivity in detection and suggested evolving mechanisms with progressive injury. NFL was the most sensitive neuronal biomarker. Its CSF concentration exceeded age-adjusted norms in all HAD patients, 75% of NA CD4<50, 40% of NA CD4 50-199, and 42% of primary infection, indicating common neuronal injury with untreated systemic HIV disease progression as well as transiently during early infection. By contrast, only 75% of HAD subjects had abnormal CSF t-tau levels, and there were no significant differences in t-tau levels among the remaining groups. sAPPα and β were also abnormal (decreased) in HAD, showed less marked change than NFL with CD4 decline in the absence of HAD, and were not decreased in PHI. The CSF Aβ peptides and p-tau concentrations did not differ among the groups, distinguishing the HIV CNS injury profile from Alzheimer's disease.

However, controllers have evidence of ongoing inflammation, CD4(+) T cell depletion, and perhaps even inflammation-associated cardiovascular disease, suggesting that this natural long term virologic control may be coming at an immunologic and clinical cost.

We here describe the case of an HIV-1(+) woman, CASE1, who has spontaneously controlled her viremia for the last 14 of her 20 years of infection. CASE1 has been clinically monitored since 1993. Detailed immunological, virological and histological analyses were performed on samples obtained between 2009 and 2011. As for other Elite Controllers, CASE1 is characterized by low to undetectable levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) associated HIV-1 DNA and reduced in vitro susceptibility of target cells to HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, a slow rate of virus evolution was demonstrated in spite the lack of assumption of any antiretroviral agent. CASE1 failed to transmit HIV-1 to either her sexual male partner or to her child born by vaginal delivery. Normal values and ratios of T and B cells were observed, along with normal histology of the intestinal mucosa. Attempts to isolate HIV-1 from her PBMC and gut-derived cells were unsuccessful, despite expression of normal cell surface levels of CD4, CCRC5 and CXCR4. CASE1 did not produce detectable anti-HIV neutralizing antibodies in her serum or genital mucosal fluid although she displayed potent T cell responses against HIV-1 Gag and Nef. CASE1 also possessed multiple genetic polymorphisms, including HLA alleles (B*14, B*57, C*06 and C*08.02) and HLA-C single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs9264942 C/C and rs67384697 del/del), that have been previously individually associated with spontaneous control of plasma viremia, maintenance of high CD4(+) T cell counts and delayed disease progression. CASE1 has controlled her HIV-1 viremia below the limit of detection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy for more than 14 years and has not shown any sign of immunologic deterioration or disease progression. Co-expression of multiple protective HLA alleles, HLA-C SNPs and strong T cell responses against HIV-1 proteins are the most likely explanation of this very benign case of spontaneous control of HIV-1 disease progression.","2014","2014 Dec 05","Marco Moroni; Silvia Ghezzi; Paolo Baroli; Silvia Heltai; Davide De Battista; Simone Pensieroso; Mariangela Cavarelli; Stefania Dispinseri; Irene Vanni; Claudia Pastori; Pietro Zerbi; Antonella Tosoni; Elisa Vicenzi; Manuela Nebuloni; Kim Wong; Hong Zhao; Sarah McHugh; Guido Poli; Lucia Lopalco; Gabriella Scarlatti; Roberto Biassoni; James I Mullins; Mauro S Malnati; Massimo Alfano","Infectious Disease Unit, Busto Arsizio Public Hospital, P.le Solaro n. 3, Busto Arsizio, 21052, Varese, Italy. marco-alex@libero.it.; Viral Pathogens and Biosafety Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. silvia.ghezzi@hsr.it.; Service Lab Fleming Research, Busto Arsizio, Varese, Italy. ibaroli@alice.it.; Human Virology Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. silvia.heltai@hsr.it.; Human Virology Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. davide.debattista@hsr.it.; Viral Evolution and Transmission Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. simone.shimon@gmail.com.; Viral Evolution and Transmission Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. mariangela.cavarelli@hsr.it.; Viral Evolution and Transmission Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. stefania.dispinseri@hsr.it.; Department of Translational Research, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy. irenevanni85@yahoo.it.; Immunobiology of HIV Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. claudia.pastori@hsr.it.; Pathology Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. pietro.zerbi@unimi.it.; Pathology Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. antotosoni@yahoo.it.; Viral Pathogens and Biosafety Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. elisa.vicenzi@hsr.it.; Pathology Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. manuela.nebuloni@unimi.it.; Departments of Microbiology, Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. kwong@u.washington.edu.; Departments of Microbiology, Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. hzhao@u.washington.edu.; Departments of Microbiology, Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. mchugs2@u.washington.edu.; AIDS Immunopathogenesis Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Via Olgettina n. 58, Milan, 20132, Italy. guido.poli@hsr.it.; School of Medicine, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy. guido.poli@hsr.it.; Immunobiology of HIV Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. lucia.lopalco@hsr.it.; Viral Evolution and Transmission Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. gabriella.scarlatti@hsr.it.; Department of Translational Research, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy. robertobiassoni@gmail.com.; Departments of Microbiology, Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. jmullins@uw.edu.; Human Virology Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. mauro.malnati@hsr.it.; AIDS Immunopathogenesis Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Via Olgettina n. 58, Milan, 20132, Italy. massimo.alfano@hsr.it.; Present address; Division of Experimental Oncology, Unit of Urology, URI; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Via Olgettina n. 60, Milan, 20132, Italy. massimo.alfano@hsr.it."

This so-called ""cure"" or ""remission"" might be due to complete eradication of all replication-competent HIV during ART or durable host-mediated control of persistent virus in absence of ART. Recent heroic interventions such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant and very early initiation of antiretroviral therapy suggest that dramatic reductions in the reservoir size can be achieved, but that complete eradication will be difficult if not impossible to achieve. Most attempts to stimulate effective host-mediated control of HIV have failed. It is likely that for a true cure to be achieved, both approaches - reductions in the reservoir size and durable immune surveillance - will be needed, a state that is similar to that observed in ""elite"" controllers and post-treatment controllers.

Residual immune activation persists even in patients controlling virus replication and remains a significant source of ongoing disease morbidities, but the causes are unclear. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), primary producers of interferon (IFN)-α, have been previously shown to be depleted from peripheral blood of HIV patients and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques, and most recently have been shown to accumulate in the gut mucosa. Although previous work has shown that pDC frequencies can be reduced in the circulation of HIV-1 Elite Controllers, it is unknown if gut-homing also occurs. In this new study we found that during progressive HIV-1 infection pDCs were depleted in peripheral blood compared to seronegative controls, and, correlating with plasma viremia, the remaining pDCs upregulated the gut-homing marker, α4β7. Even in HIV-1 Elite Controllers pDCs were significantly reduced in blood and α4β7 expression was still significantly upregulated compared to seronegative controls. Interestingly, pDC trafficking to the gut was associated with increased Ki67 and HLA-DR on circulating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Overall, these data suggest that gut trafficking of pDCs is independent of virus replication and could be mediated by alternative mechanisms, which in turn could contribute to residual immune activation in HIV-1 Elite Controllers.","2014","2014 Dec","Haiying Li; Paul Goepfert; R Keith Reeves","1 Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , Boston, Massachusetts."

In previous work with transgenic mice expressing HIV genes, B-cell dysregulations were concomitant with altered mDCs and dependent on HIV negative factor (Nef). We now report that HIV Nef is detected early after infection and despite successful therapy in plasma and BLyS-overexpressing blood mDCs of HIV-infected rapid and classic progressors, whereas it is low to undetectable in aviremic slow progressors. In vitro, HIV Nef drives monocyte-derived DCs toward BLyS overexpression through a process involving STAT1. Importantly, this is counteracted in the presence of all-trans retinoic acid.

The current study characterized CD161(+) MAIT and CD161-TCRVα7.2(+) T cell subsets within a large cohort of HIV patients with emphasis on patients with slow disease progression and elite controllers. Mononuclear cells from blood and lymph node samples as well as plasma from 63 patients and 26 healthy donors were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry and ELISA for IL-18, sCD14 and sCD163. Additionally, MAIT cells were analyzed after in vitro stimulation with different cytokines and/or fixed E.coli. Reduced numbers of CD161(+) MAIT cells during HIV infection were detectable in the blood and lymph nodes of all patient groups, including elite controllers. CD161+ MAIT cell numbers did not recover even after successful antiretroviral treatment. The loss of CD161(+) MAIT cells was correlated with higher levels of MAIT cell activation; an increased frequency of the CD161-TCRVα7.2(+)T cell subset in HIV infection was observed. In vitro stimulation of MAIT cells with IL-18 and IL-12, IL-7 and fixed E.coli also resulted in a rapid and additive reduction of the MAIT cell frequency defined by CD161, IL-18R and CCR6. In summary, the irreversible reduction of the CD161(+) MAIT cell subset seems to be an early event in HIV infection that is independent of later stages of the disease. This loss appears to be at least partially due to the distinctive vulnerability of MAIT cells to the pronounced stimulation by microbial products and cytokines during HIV-infection.","2014","2014","Johanna Maria Eberhard; Philip Hartjen; Silke Kummer; Reinhold E Schmidt; Maximilian Bockhorn; Clara Lehmann; Ashwin Balagopal; Joachim Hauber; Jan van Lunzen; Julian Schulze zur Wiesch","Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; Heinrich Pette Institute - Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.; Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; Heinrich Pette Institute - Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.; Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; Heinrich Pette Institute - Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.; Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Hannover Medical School, Hanover, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Hamburg and Hannover, Hamburg and Hannover, Germany.; Department of General Surgery, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.; School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.; Heinrich Pette Institute - Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Hamburg and Hannover, Hamburg and Hannover, Germany.; Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; Heinrich Pette Institute - Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Hamburg and Hannover, Hamburg and Hannover, Germany.; Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; Heinrich Pette Institute - Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Hamburg and Hannover, Hamburg and Hannover, Germany."

However, the mechanism of this selection and the long-term control in these elite controllers remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the 8V mutant selection in these controllers. TI8-specific CTLs from these individuals evenly recognized both TI8 peptide-pulsed and TI8-8V peptide-pulsed cells and effectively suppressed replication of wild-type (WT) and the 8V viruses. However, the results of a competitive viral suppression assay demonstrated that CTLs from the individual who had WT virus could discriminate WT virus from the 8V virus, whereas those from the individuals who had the 8V virus evenly recognized both viruses. The former CTLs carried TCRs with weaker affinity for the HLA-B*51:01-TI8-8V molecule than for the HLA-B*51:01-TI-8 one, whereas the latter ones carried TCRs with similar affinity for both molecules. The reconstruction of the TCRs from these CTLs in TCR-deficient cells confirmed the different recognition of the TCRs for these epitopes. The present study showed that the 8V mutant virus could be selected by cross-reactive CTLs carrying TCR that could discriminate a small difference between the two molecules. The selection of the 8V mutant and elicitation of these two cross-reactive CTLs may contribute to the long-term control of HIV-1.","2014","2014 Nov 15","Nozomi Kuse; Tomohiro Akahoshi; Hiroyuki Gatanaga; Takamasa Ueno; Shinichi Oka; Masafumi Takiguchi","Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan;; Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan;; Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan; AIDS Clinical Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo 162-8655, Japan; and.; Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan; International Research Center of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.; Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan; AIDS Clinical Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo 162-8655, Japan; and.; Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan; International Research Center of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan masafumi@kumamoto-u.ac.jp."

Profiling analysis segregated the population in two different blocks: while EC and HIV- clustered together in the same block (EC/HIV-_block 1), VP and ART individuals clustered together in a second block (VP/ART_block 2). Two inversely expressed miRNA patterns were determined within those two blocks: a set of 4 miRNAs (hsa-miR-221, -27a, -27b and -29b) was up-expressed in EC/HIV-_block and down-expressed in VP/ART_block while 19 miRNAs were down-expressed in block 1 and up-expressed in block 2. Differential miRNAs were successfully validated through individual RT-qPCR assays. Profile in EC resembled HIV- and differentially clusters with VP and ART. Therefore, differential clustering does not rely on undetectable viremia.","2014","2014","Lander Egaña-Gorroño; Tuixent Escribà; Nicolas Boulanger; Alberto Crespo Guardo; Agathe León; Manel Enric Bargalló; Felipe Garcia; José María Gatell; Montserrat Plana; Mireia Arnedo; ","Group of Genomics and Pharmacogenomics, AIDS Research Group, Catalan project for the development of an HIV vaccine (HIVACAT), Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Group of Genomics and Pharmacogenomics, AIDS Research Group, Catalan project for the development of an HIV vaccine (HIVACAT), Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Group of Genomics and Pharmacogenomics, AIDS Research Group, Catalan project for the development of an HIV vaccine (HIVACAT), Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico, Scientific Park of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Immunopathology and Cellular Immunology, AIDS Research Group, Catalan project for the development of an HIV vaccine (HIVACAT), Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Immunopathology and Cellular Immunology, AIDS Research Group, Catalan project for the development of an HIV vaccine (HIVACAT), Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Immunopathology and Cellular Immunology, AIDS Research Group, Catalan project for the development of an HIV vaccine (HIVACAT), Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Group of Genomics and Pharmacogenomics, AIDS Research Group, Catalan project for the development of an HIV vaccine (HIVACAT), Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."

In this study, the Consortium for the Evaluation and Performance of HIV Incidence Assays presents results of the first independent evaluation of five incidence assays (BED, Limiting Antigen Avidity, Less-sensitive Vitros, Vitros Avidity and BioRad Avidity). A large repository of diverse specimens from HIV-positive patients was established, multiple assays were run on 2500 selected specimens, and data were analyzed to estimate assay characteristics relevant for incidence surveillance. The mean duration of recent infection (MDRI, average time 'recent' while infected for less than some time cut-off T) was estimated from longitudinal data on seroconverters by regression. The false-recent rate (FRR, probability of testing 'recent' when infected for longer than T) was explored by measuring the proportions of 'recent' results in various subsets of patients. Assays continue to fail to attain the simultaneously large MDRI and small FRR demanded by existing performance guidelines. All assays produce high FRRs amongst virally suppressed patients (>40%), including elite controllers and treated patients. Results from this first independent evaluation provide valuable information about the current performance of assays, and suggest the need for further optimization. Variation of 'recent'/'nonrecent' thresholds and the use of multiple antibody-maturation assays, as well as other biomarkers, can now be explored, using the rich data generated by the Consortium for the Evaluation and Performance of HIV Incidence Assays. Consistently high FRRs amongst those virally suppressed suggest that viral load will be a particularly valuable supplementary marker.","2014","2014 Oct 23","Reshma Kassanjee; Christopher D Pilcher; Sheila M Keating; Shelley N Facente; Elaine McKinney; Matthew A Price; Jeffrey N Martin; Susan Little; Frederick M Hecht; Esper G Kallas; Alex Welte; Michael P Busch; Gary Murphy; ","aThe South African DST/NRF Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA), Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch bSchool of Computational and Applied Mathematics, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa cUniversity of California, San Francisco dBlood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA ePublic Health England, London, UK fInternational AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), Department of Medical Affairs, New York City, New York gUniversity of California San Diego, Department of Medicine, San Diego, California, USA hDivision of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, School of Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil."

Studies from Africa have suggested that this susceptibility is related in part to the development of a high level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-specific IgG that is able to inhibit the killing of S. Typhimurium by bactericidal antibodies in healthy individuals. To explore this issue further, we examined the bactericidal activity against S. Typhimurium using serum and plasma samples from healthy controls and various clinical subgroups of HIV-infected adults in the United States. We found that the bactericidal activity in the samples from HIV-positive elite controllers was comparable to that from healthy individuals, whereas it was significantly reduced in HIV-positive viremic controllers and untreated chronic progressors. As demonstrated previously for healthy controls, the bactericidal activity of the plasma from the elite controllers was inhibited by preincubation with S. Typhimurium LPS, suggesting that it was mediated by anti-LPS antibodies. S. Typhimurium LPS-specific IgG was significantly reduced in all subgroups of HIV-infected individuals. Interestingly, and in contrast to the healthy controls, plasma from all HIV-positive subgroups inhibited in vitro killing of S. Typhimurium by plasma from a healthy individual. Our results, together with the findings from Africa, suggest that multiple mechanisms may be involved in the HIV-induced dysregulation of humoral immunity to S.

However, correlates of immune protection remain elusive. Although the importance of CD8+ T-cell specificity and functionality in virus control has been underscored, further unraveling the link between CD8+ T-cell differentiation and viral control is needed. Here, an immunophenotypic analysis (in terms of memory markers and Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) expression) of the CD8+ T-cell subset found in primary HIV infection (PHI) was performed. The aim was to seek for associations with functional properties of the CD8+ T-cell subsets, viral control and subsequent disease progression. Also, results were compared with samples from Chronics and Elite Controllers. It was found that normal maturation of total and HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells into memory subsets is skewed in PHI, but not at the dramatic level observed in Chronics. Within the HIV-specific compartment, this alteration was evidenced by an accumulation of effector memory CD8+ T (TEM) cells over fully differentiated terminal effector CD8+ T (TTE) cells. Furthermore, higher proportions of total and HIV-specific CD8+ TEM cells and higher HIV-specific TEM/(TEM+TTE) ratio correlated with markers of faster progression. Analysis of PD-1 expression on total and HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells from PHI subjects revealed not only an association with disease progression but also with skewed memory CD8+ T-cell differentiation. Most notably, significant direct correlations were obtained between the functional capacity of CD8+ T-cells to inhibit viral replication in vitro with higher proportions of fully-differentiated HIV-specific CD8+ TTE cells, both at baseline and at 12 months post-infection. Thus, a relationship between preservation of CD8+ T-cell differentiation pathway and cell functionality was established. This report presents evidence concerning the link among CD8+ T-cell function, phenotype and virus control, hence supporting the instauration of early interventions to prevent irreversible immune damage.","2014","2014","Yanina Ghiglione; Juliana Falivene; María Julia Ruiz; Natalia Laufer; María Eugenia Socías; Pedro Cahn; Luis Giavedoni; Omar Sued; María Magdalena Gherardi; Horacio Salomón; Gabriela Turk","Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), Universidad de Buenos Aires- CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina.; Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), Universidad de Buenos Aires- CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina.; Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), Universidad de Buenos Aires- CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina.; Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), Universidad de Buenos Aires- CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Hospital J.A.

The mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are poorly understood. As microRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of gene expression and some of them modulate HIV infection, we have studied the miRNA profile in plasma from HIV elite controllers and chronically infected individuals and compared against healthy donors. Several miRNAs correlate with CD4+ T cell count or with the known time of infection. No significant differences were observed between elite controllers and healthy donors; however, 16 miRNAs were different in the plasma of chronic infected versus healthy donors. In addition, levels of hsa-miR-29b-3p, hsa-miR-33a-5p and hsa-miR-146a-5p were higher in plasma from elite controllers than chronic infected and hsa-miR-29b-3p and hsa-miR-33a-5p overexpression significantly reduced the viral production in MT2 and primary T CD4+ cells. Therefore, levels of circulating miRNAs might be of diagnostic and/or prognostic value for HIV infection, and hsa-miR-29b-3p and miR-33a-5p may contribute to the design of new anti-HIV drugs.","2014","2014 Aug 01","Rita Reynoso; Natalia Laufer; Matthias Hackl; Susanna Skalicky; Rossella Monteforte; Gabriela Turk; Mauricio Carobene; Jorge Quarleri; Pedro Cahn; Roland Werner; Heribert Stoiber; Regina Grillari-Voglauer; Johannes Grillari","Department of Biotechnology, CD laboratory on Biotechnology of Skin Aging, BOKU - University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna, Muthgasse 18, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.; 1] Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), Universidad de Buenos Aires/CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina [2] CONICET, Argentina [3] J.A.

Importantly, in aviremic HIV-1 Elite-Controllers (EC), we found unaltered relative percentages of precursor MZ-like B-cells which presented normal IL-10 expression patterns. Furthermore, EC had increased relative frequencies of blood MZ-like B-cells expressing LT-α.

The mechanisms of virologic control are not fully understood, but ESs have been shown to have a more effective CD8+ T cell response to infected CD4+ T cells than chronic progressors (CPs). While macrophages are another cell type productively infected by HIV-1, few studies have examined the ability of primary effector T cells to suppress HIV-1 replication in these target cells. Here, we compared the ability of unstimulated primary CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells to suppress viral replication in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in ESs and CPs. While CD4+ effector T cells were capable of inhibiting viral replication in MDMs, the magnitude of this response was not significantly different between ESs and CPs. In contrast, the CD8+ T cells from ESs were significantly more effective than those from CPs at inhibiting viral replication in MDMs. The CD4+ T cell response was partially mediated by soluble factors, while the CD8+ T cell response required cell-to-cell interaction. Our results suggest that the individual contributions of various effector cells should be considered in rational vaccine design and in ongoing eradication efforts. Elite suppressors are individuals capable of maintaining low-level viremia in HIV-1 infection without antiretroviral drugs. Their T cell responses have been implicated in eliminating infected CD4+ T cells, and as such, elite suppressors may represent a model of a functional cure of HIV-1 infection. Here, we sought to determine whether the suppressive T cell responses against infected CD4+ T cells also apply to infected macrophages by comparing the responses of elite suppressors and HIV-1-positive individuals on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Our results show that the CD8+ cells but not CD4+ T cells from elite suppressors have a response against infected macrophages superior to the response of CD8+ cells from patients on HAART.

Here we assessed the link between sCD40L, Tregs and IDO activity in HIV-infected patients with different clinical outcomes. Plasmatic sCD40L and inflammatory cytokines were assessed in anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-naive, ART-successfully treated (ST), elite controllers (EC) and healthy subjects (HS).

IDO-mRNA expression was quantified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The in-vitro functional assay of sCD40L on Treg induction and T cell activation were assessed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HS. sCD40L levels in ART-naive subjects were significantly higher compared to ST and HS, whereas EC showed only a minor increase. In ART-naive alone, sCD40L was correlated with T cell activation, IDO-mRNA expression and CD4 T cell depletion but not with viral load. sCD40L was correlated positively with IDO enzymatic activity (Kyn/Trp ratio), Treg frequency, plasma sCD14 and inflammatory soluble factors in all HIV-infected patients. In-vitro functional sCD40L stimulation induced Treg expansion and favoured Treg differentiation by reducing central memory and increasing terminal effector Treg proportion. sCD40L also increased T cell activation measured by co-expression of CD38/human leucocyte antigen D-related (HLA-DR).

CDK2-dependent phosphorylation increased the efficacy and stability of viral reverse transcriptase and enhanced viral fitness. Interestingly, p21, a cell-intrinsic CDK inhibitor that is upregulated in CD4(+) T cells from ""elite controllers,"" potently inhibited CDK2-dependent phosphorylation of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and significantly reduced the efficacy of viral reverse transcription.

HIV controllers, including long-term non-progressors (LTNP) and elite controllers (EC), represent an interesting subgroup in this regard, as here nAbs can develop over time in a rather healthy immune system and in the absence of any therapeutic selection pressure. In this study, we characterized two particular antibodies that were selected as scFv antibody fragments from a phage immune library generated from an LTNP with HIV neutralizing antibodies in his plasma. The phage library was screened on recombinant soluble gp140 envelope (Env) proteins. Sequencing the selected peptide inserts revealed two major classes of antibody sequences. Binding analysis of the corresponding scFv-Fc derivatives to various trimeric and monomeric Env constructs as well as to peptide arrays showed that one class, represented by monoclonal antibody (mAb) A2, specifically recognizes an epitope localized in the pocket binding domain of the C heptad repeat (CHR) in the ectodomain of gp41, but only in the trimeric context. Thus, this antibody represents an interesting tool for trimer identification.

While neutralizing antibodies have proven difficult to induce through vaccination, extra-neutralizing antibodies, such as those that mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), are associated with long-term control of infection. However, while several non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been tested for their protective efficacy in vivo, no studies to date have tested the protective activity of naturally produced polyclonal antibodies from individuals harboring potent ADCC activity. Because ADCC-inducing antibodies are highly enriched in elite controllers (EC), we passively transferred highly functional non-neutralizing polyclonal antibodies, purified from an EC, to assess the potential impact of polyclonal non-neutralizing antibodies on a stringent SHIV-SF162P3 challenge in rhesus monkeys. Passive transfer of a low-dose of ADCC inducing antibodies did not protect from infection following SHIV-SF162P3 challenge. Passively administered antibody titers and gp120-specific, but not gp41-specific, ADCC and antibody induced phagocytosis (ADCP) were detected in the majority of the monkeys, but did not correlate with post infection viral control. Thus these data raise the possibility that gp120-specific ADCC activity alone may not be sufficient to control viremia post infection but that other specificities or Fc-effector profiles, alone or in combination, may have an impact on viral control and should be tested in future passive transfer experiments.","2014","2014","Anne-Sophie Dugast; Ying Chan; Michelle Hoffner; Anna Licht; Joseph Nkolola; Hualin Li; Hendrik Streeck; Todd J Suscovich; Musie Ghebremichael; Margaret E Ackerman; Dan H Barouch; Galit Alter","Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Military HIV Research Program, Henry Jackson Foundation, Rockville, Maryland, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America; Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."

Whole-genome transcriptional study and quantification of the cell-associated HIV DNA and HIV RNA levels of the four major resting CD4 T-cell subsets in HIV-1-infected elite controllers, viremic long-term nonprogressors (vir-LTNPs), and uninfected individuals. We compared the whole-genome transcriptional profiles (ArrayExpress accession number E-MTAB-1480) of the four major resting CD4 T-cell subsets [naive (TN), central-memory (TCM), transitional-memory (TTM), and effector-memory (TEM)] from 14 HIV-1-infected individuals including seven elite controllers (E-LTNPs) and seven vir-LTNPs, and from seven uninfected individuals. The HIV-1 cellular DNA and mRNA levels were quantified in parallel in each sorted subset. Host gene transcriptomes followed subset differentiation and viremia except in E-LTNPs wherein TCM, the main CD4 cell compartment, showed the highest activity with three specific signatures involving overexpression of T-cell receptor and costimulation signaling pathways, overexpression of the PRDM-1/Blimp-1 transcriptional repressor, and downmodulation of type-I IFN-related genes. Among subsets, the PRDM1/Blimp-1 upregulation was associated with lower levels of both cellular HIV-DNA and HIV mRNA levels. This unique Blimp-1 transcriptional repressor signature and the contrast between host and virus transcriptional activities in TCM from elite controllers suggest Blimp-1 might be involved in controlling the HIV reservoirs in the key TCM subset.","2014","2014 Jul 17","Adèle de Masson; Amos Kirilovsky; Rima Zoorob; Véronique Avettand-Fenoel; Véronique Morin; Anne Oudin; Benjamin Descours; Christine Rouzioux; Brigitte Autran","aLaboratoire «Immunité et Infection», INSERM UMRS 945, Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière bUniversité Paris VI Pierre et Marie Curie cLaboratoire de Virologie, Hôpital Necker Enfants Malades, Université Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, EA3620, AP-HP, Paris, France. *Adèle de Masson and Amos Kirilovsky equally contributed to this article."

Gal-9 was initially thought to be an eosinophil attractant, but is now known to mediate multiple complex signaling events that affect T cells in both an immunosuppressive and inflammatory manner. To understand the kinetics of circulating Gal-9 levels during HIV infection we measured Gal-9 in plasma during HIV acquisition, in subjects with chronic HIV infection with differing virus control, and in uninfected individuals. During acute HIV infection, circulating Gal-9 was detected as early as 5 days after quantifiable HIV RNA and tracked plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-1β. In chronic HIV infection, Gal-9 levels positively correlated with plasma HIV RNA levels (r=0.29; p=0.023), and remained significantly elevated during suppressive antiretroviral therapy (median: 225.3 pg/ml) and in elite controllers (263.3 pg/ml) compared to age-matched HIV-uninfected controls (54 pg/ml). Our findings identify Gal-9 as a novel component of the first wave of the cytokine storm in acute HIV infection that is sustained at elevated levels in virally suppressed subjects and suggest that Gal-9:Tim-3 crosstalk remains active in elite controllers and antiretroviral (ARV)-suppressed subjects, potentially contributing to ongoing inflammation and persistent T cell dysfunction.","2014","2014 Jul","Ravi Tandon; Glen M Chew; Mary M Byron; Persephone Borrow; Toshiro Niki; Mitsuomi Hirashima; Jason D Barbour; Philip J Norris; Marion C Lanteri; Jeffrey N Martin; Steven G Deeks; Lishomwa C Ndhlovu","1 Hawaii Center for AIDS, Department of Tropical Medicine, University of Hawaii , John A.

Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), attenuated anti-HIV CTL functions present a major hurdle towards curative measures requiring viral eradication. Therefore, deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying impaired CTL is crucial before HIV viral eradication is viable. The generation of robust CTL activity necessitates interactions between antigen-presenting cells (APC), CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We have shown that in vitro, IL-10hiPD-L1hi regulatory B cells (Bregs) directly attenuate HIV-specific CD8+-mediated CTL activity. Bregs also modulate APC and CD4+ T cell function; herein we characterize the Breg compartment in uninfected (HIVNEG), HIV-infected ""elite controllers"" (HIVEC), ART-treated (HIVART), and viremic (HIVvir), subjects, and in vitro, assess the impact of Bregs on anti-HIV CTL generation and activity after reactivation of HIV latent reservoirs using suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). We find that Bregs from HIVEC and HIVART subjects exhibit comparable IL-10 expression levels significantly higher than HIVNEG subjects, but significantly lower than HIVVIR subjects. Bregs from HIVEC and HIVART subjects exhibit comparable PD-L1 expression, significantly higher than in HIVVIR and HIVNEG subjects. SAHA-treated Breg-depleted PBMC from HIVEC and HIVART subjects, displayed enhanced CD4+ T-cell proliferation, significant upregulation of antigen-presentation molecules, increased frequency of CD107a+ and HIV-specific CD8+ T cells, associated with efficient elimination of infected CD4+ T cells, and reduction in integrated viral DNA. Finally, IL-10-R and PD-1 antibody blockade partially reversed Breg-mediated inhibition of CD4+ T-cell proliferation. Our data suggest that, possibly, via an IL-10 and PD-L1 synergistic mechanism; Bregs likely inhibit APC function and CD4+ T-cell proliferation, leading to anti-HIV CTL attenuation, hindering viral eradication.","2014","2014","Basile Siewe; Jennillee Wallace; Sonya Rygielski; Jack T Stapleton; Jeffrey Martin; Steven G Deeks; Alan Landay","Rush University Medical Center, Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.; Rush University Medical Center, Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.; Rush University Medical Center, Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.; Iowa City Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the University of Iowa, Departments of Internal Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology, Iowa City, Iowa, United States of America.; HIV/AIDS Division, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco, California, United States of America.; HIV/AIDS Division, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco, California, United States of America.; Rush University Medical Center, Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America; FC Donders Chair, Division of Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Science, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands."

However, on occasion, rare hyper-responsive elite controllers are able to mount a protective primary response to infection and clear the new pathogen. Factors distinguishing elite controllers from other members of the population are not completely understood. We have been using Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis as a model of primary infection in mice and clearance of the virus is limited to one MHC genotype capable of generating a protective response to a single viral peptide VP2121-130. The genetics of host susceptibility to TMEV, a natural mouse pathogen, has been studied extensively and non-protective CD8 responses to other peptides have been documented, however, little is known why the protective response to infection focuses on the VP2121-130 peptide. To study this question, we have generated TMEV mutants that encode for mutations within the VP2121-130 peptide. We find that very few of mutants are able to assemble and infect in vitro. These mutations are not related to virus RNA structure since non-coding mutations do not interfere with assembly. In the rare event when functional VP2121-130 mutant viruses did emerge, they were attenuated to some level or retained the ability to develop an immune response to the wild-type VP2121-130 sequence, demonstrating that the virus is incapable of escaping the protective response. These findings advance our understanding of how characteristics of the host immune response and an infectious agent can interact to lead to the appearance of rare super controllers in a population. Furthermore, the immutable nature of the viral antigen highlights the importance of choosing appropriate vaccine antigens and has implications for the development of agents that are able to generate protective CD8 T-cell responses.","2014","2014","Michael P Bell; Danielle N Renner; Aaron J Johnson; Kevin D Pavelko","Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America.; Neurobiology of Disease Program, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America.; Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America; Department of Neurology, Mayo Graduate School, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America.; Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America."

We also mapped the specificity of the humoral response to HERV-K (HML-2) Envelope protein in HIV-1 infected subjects at different stages of disease, and correlated the response with plasma viral load. We found that HIV-1 modified HERV-K (HML-2) Env mRNA expression, resulting in the expression of a fully N-glycosylated HERV-K (HML-2) envelope protein on the cell surface. Serological mapping of HERV-K (HML-2) envelope protein linear epitopes revealed two major immunogenic domains, one on SU and another on the ectodomain of TM. The titers of HERV-K (HML-2) TM antibodies were dramatically increased in HIV-1 infected subjects (p < 0.0001). HIV-1 infected adults who control HIV-1 in the absence of therapy (""elite"" controllers) had a higher titer response against TM compared to antiretroviral-treated adults (p < 0.0001) and uninfected adults (p < 0.0001). These data collectively suggest that HIV-1 infection induces fully glycosylated HERV-K (HML-2) envelope TM protein to which antibodies are induced.

The mechanism of control remains unclear, but the HLA-B*57 allele is overrepresented in cohorts of these patients. However, many HLA-B*57 patients develop progressive disease, and some studies have suggested that infection with defective viruses may be the cause of the lack of high levels of virus replication and disease progression in ES. We therefore performed a comprehensive comparative in vivo and in vitro characterization of viruses isolated from well-defined ES. For this purpose, we first performed full-genome sequence analysis and in vitro fitness assays on replication-competent isolates from HLA-B*57 ES and HLA-B*57 chronic progressors (CPs). Under our experimental conditions, we found that isolates from ES and CPs can replicate in vitro. However, since inherently these assays involve the use of unnaturally in vitro-activated cells, we also investigated the replication competence and pathogenic potential of these HIV isolates in vivo using humanized BLT mice. The results from these analyses demonstrate that virus isolates from ES are fully replication competent in vivo and can induce peripheral and systemic CD4 T cell depletion. These results provide the first direct in vivo evidence that viral fitness does not likely determine clinical outcome in HLA-B*57 patients and that elite suppressors can control replication-competent, fully pathogenic viruses. A better understanding of the immunological bases of viral suppression in ES will serve to inform novel approaches to preventive and therapeutic HIV vaccine design. Elite suppressors are HIV-1-infected patients who have undetectable levels of viremia despite not being on antiviral drugs. One of the most fundamental questions about this phenomenon involves the mechanism of control. To address this question, we isolated virus from elite suppressors and from HIV-1-infected patients who have the usual progressive disease course.

Here we report that CD73, both a coactivator molecule of T cells and an immunosuppressive ecto-enzyme through adenosine production, is only weakly expressed by CD8+ T cells of HIV-infected patients and only partially restored after successful antiviral treatment. CD73 expression on CD8+ T cells correlates inversely with cell activation both ex vivo and in vitro. However, CD8+ T cells from HIV controllers (HICs), which spontaneously control HIV replication, express CD73 strongly, despite residual immune activation. Finally, we demonstrate that CD73 is involved in the HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell expansion. Thus, we show that CD73 is central to the functionality of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells and that the preservation of HIV-specific CD73+ CD8+ T cells is a characteristic of HICs.

These pathways are attractive targets for immunotherapy, as demonstrated by recent clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in cancer patients. However, in HIV-1 infection not all subjects respond to inhibition of either pathway and the mechanistic interactions between these two networks remain to be better defined. Here we demonstrate that in vitro blockade of PD-L1 and/or IL-10Rα results in markedly different profiles of HIV-1-specific CD4 T cell restoration. Whereas PD-L1 blockade leads to balanced increase in gamma interferon (IFN-γ), IL-2, and IL-13 secretion, IL-10Rα blockade preferentially restores IFN-γ production. In viremic subjects, combined PD-L1/IL-10Rα blockade results in a striking 10-fold increase in IFN-γ secretion by HIV-1-specific CD4 T cells that is not observed in subjects with spontaneous (elite controllers) or therapy-induced control of viral replication. In contrast to the dramatic increase in IFN-γ production, concurrent blockade has a marginal additive effect on IL-2 production, IL-13 secretion, and HIV-1-specific CD4 T cell proliferation. IFN-γ produced by Thelper cells upregulates PD-L1, HLA I/II, and IL-12 expression by monocytes. The effect of combined blockade on IFN-γ was dependent on reciprocal reinforcement through IL-12. These studies provide crucial information on the different immunoregulatory qualities of PD-1 and IL-10 in progressive disease and link exhausted virus-specific CD4 T cells and monocytes in the regulation of IFN-γ and IL-12 secretion. Infection with HIV results in most people in uncontrolled viral replication and progressive weakening of the body defenses. In the absence of antiviral therapy, this process results in clinical disease, or AIDS. An important reason why HIV continues to multiply is that a population of white blood cells called CD4 T cells that targets the virus fails to work properly. At least part of this impairment is under the control of inhibitory mechanisms that can be blocked to improve the function of these CD4 T cells. In this report, we show that blocking one or two of the molecules involved, called PD-1 and IL-10, has different effects on the individual functions of these cells and that one is strongly improved. We investigate how these effects are caused by interactions between CD4 T cells and antigen-presenting cells. These observations can have implications for new therapeutic approaches in HIV infection.","2014","2014 Mar","Filippos Porichis; Meghan G Hart; Jennifer Zupkosky; Lucie Barblu; Douglas S Kwon; Ashley McMullen; Thomas Brennan; Rafi Ahmed; Gordon J Freeman; Daniel G Kavanagh; Daniel E Kaufmann","Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the control of viral replication in these patients is due to a strong and specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. The ability of CD8+ T cells to control HIV-1 replication is believed to be impaired by the development of escape mutations. Surprisingly, viruses amplified from the plasma of ES have been shown to contain multiple escape mutations, and it is not clear how immunologic control is maintained in the face of virologic escape. We investigated the effect of escape mutations within HLA*B-57-restricted Gag epitopes on the CD8+ T cell mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication. Using site directed mutagenesis, we constructed six NL4-3 based viruses with canonical escape mutations in one to three HLA*B-57-restricted Gag epitopes. Interestingly, similar levels of CTL-mediated suppression of replication in autologous primary CD4+ T cells were observed for all of the escape mutants. Intracellular cytokine staining was performed in order to determine the mechanisms involved in the suppression of the escape variants. While low baseline CD8+ T cells responses to wild type and escape variant peptides were seen, stimulation of PBMC with either wild type or escape variant peptides resulted in increased IFN-γ and perforin expression. These data presented demonstrate that CD8+ T cells from ES are capable of suppressing replication of virus harboring escape mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted Gag epitopes. Additionally, our data suggest that ES CD8+ T cells are capable of generating effective de novo responses to escape mutants.","2013","2013 Dec 12","Christopher W Pohlmeyer; Robert W Buckheit; Robert F Siliciano; Joel N Blankson","Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 733 N, Broadway, BRB 880, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. jblanks@jhmi.edu."

Neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) are thought to play a central role in HIV-2 evolution and pathogenesis. However, the dynamic of the Nab response and resulting HIV-2 escape during acute infection and their impact in HIV-2 evolution and disease progression remain largely unknown. Our objective was to characterize the Nab response and the molecular and phenotypic evolution of HIV-2 in association with Nab escape in the first years of infection in two children infected at birth. CD4⁺ T cells decreased from about 50% to below 30% in both children in the first five years of infection and the infecting R5 viruses were replaced by X4 viruses within the same period. With antiretroviral therapy, viral load in child 1 decreased to undetectable levels and CD4+ T cells recovered to normal levels, which have been sustained at least until the age of 12. In contrast, viral load increased in child 2 and she progressed to AIDS and death at age 9. Beginning in the first year of life, child 1 raised high titers of antibodies that neutralized primary R5 isolates more effectively than X4 isolates, both autologous and heterologous. Child 2 raised a weak X4-specific Nab response that decreased sharply as disease progressed. Rate of evolution, nucleotide and amino acid diversity, and positive selection, were significantly higher in the envelope of child 1 compared to child 2. Rates of R5-to-X4 tropism switch, of V1 and V3 sequence diversification, and of convergence of V3 to a β-hairpin structure were related with rate of escape from the neutralizing antibodies. Our data suggests that the molecular and phenotypic evolution of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 envelope are related with the dynamics of the neutralizing antibody response providing further support for a model in which Nabs play an important role in HIV-2 pathogenesis.","2013","2013 Oct 24","Cheila Rocha; Rita Calado; Pedro Borrego; José Maria Marcelino; Inês Bártolo; Lino Rosado; Patrícia Cavaco-Silva; Perpétua Gomes; Carlos Família; Alexandre Quintas; Helena Skar; Thomas Leitner; Helena Barroso; Nuno Taveira","Unidade dos Retrovírus e Infecções Associadas, Centro de Patogénese Molecular, Faculdade de Farmácia de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal. ntaveira@ff.ul.pt."

These alterations were normalized under ART. In contrast, Trp 2,3-dioxegenase (TDO) expression was dramatically lower in EC when compared to all other groups. Interestingly, EC displayed a distinctive Trp metabolism characterized by low Trp plasma levels similar to ART-naïve patients without accumulating immunosuppressive Kyn levels which was accompanied by a preserved Th17/Treg balance.

Cell-intrinsic characteristics of CD4 T cells, the main target cells for HIV-1, may affect the composition of the latent viral reservoir by altering the susceptibility to CD8 T-cell-mediated killing. We observed that susceptibilities of CD4 T cells to CD8 T-cell-mediated killing, as determined in direct ex vivo assays, were significantly higher in persons with natural control of HIV-1 (elite controllers) than in individuals effectively treated with antiretroviral therapy. These differences were most pronounced in naive and in terminally differentiated CD4 T cells and corresponded to a reduced viral reservoir size in elite controllers. Interestingly, the highest susceptibility to CD8 T-cell-mediated killing and lowest reservoirs of cell-associated HIV-1 DNA was consistently observed in elite controllers expressing the protective HLA class I allele B57.

Herein, we demonstrate that primary CD8+ T cells from HLA-B*57/5801 elite suppressors were able to efficiently eliminate resting and activated primary CD4+ T cells shortly after viral entry and prior to productive infection. CD8+ T cells from elite suppressors were significantly more effective at eliminating these cells than CD8+ T cells from chronic progressors. Nonproductively infected CD4+ T cells may represent a subpopulation of cells that are precursors to latently infected cells; therefore, the effective elimination of these cells may partially explain why elite suppressors have a much lower frequency of latently infected cells compared to chronic progressors. Thus, a vaccine strategy that elicits early and potent CD8+ T cell responses may have the capacity to limit the seeding of the latent reservoir in HIV-1 infection.","2013","2013 Jul 01","Robert W Buckheit; Robert F Siliciano; Joel N Blankson","Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA."

At the center of this control is the HIV-specific CD8 T cell response, and the basis for this CD8-mediated control is gradually being revealed. Genome wide association studies coupled with HLA sequence data implicate the nature of the HLA-viral peptide interaction as the major genetic factor modulating durable control of HIV, but host genetic factors account for only around 20% of the variability in control. Other factors including specific functional characteristics of the TCR clonotypes generated in vivo, targeting of vulnerable regions of the virus that lead to fitness impairing mutations, immune exhaustion, and host restriction factors that limit HIV replication all have been shown to additionally contribute to control. Moreover, emerging data indicate that the CD8(+) T cell response may be critical for attempts to purge virus infected cells following activation of the latent reservoir, and thus lessons learned from elite controllers (ECs) are likely to impact the eradication agenda. On-going efforts are also needed to understand and address the role of immune activation in disease progression, as it becomes increasingly clear that durable immune control in ECs comes at a cost. Taken together, the research achievements in the attempt to unlock the mechanisms behind natural control of HIV will continue to be an important source of insights and ideas in the continuous search after an effective HIV vaccine, and for the attempts to achieve a sterilizing or functional cure in HIV positive patients with progressive infection.","2013","2013","David Shasha; Bruce D Walker","The Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard , Cambridge, MA , USA."

Surprisingly, the PD-1 promoter remained unmethylated in HIV-specific CD8 T cells from subjects with a viral load controlled by antiviral therapy for >2 y or from elite controllers.

In a small minority of cases, infection with nef/3'LTR deleted attenuated viral strains allowed control over viral replication. A common feature of LTNP is the readily detected proliferation of CD4 T-cells in vitro, in response to p24. In some cases, the responding CD4 T-cells have cytotoxic effector function and may target conserved p24 epitopes, similar to the CD8 T-cells described below. LTNP may also carry much lower HIV DNA burden in key CD4 subsets, presumably resulting from lower viral replication during primary infection. Some studies, but not others, suggest that LTNP have CD4 T-cells that are relatively resistant to HIV infection in vitro. One possible mechanism may involve up-regulation of the cell cycle regulator p21/waf in CD4 T-cells from LTNP. Delayed progression in Caucasian LTNP is also partly associated with heterozygosity of the Δ32 CCR5 allele, probably through decreased expression of CCR5 co-receptor on CD4 T-cells. However, in approximately half of Caucasian LTNP, two host genotypes, namely HLA-B57 and HLA-B27, are associated with viral control. Immunodominant CD8 T-cells from these individuals target epitopes in p24 that are highly conserved, and escape mutations have significant fitness costs to the virus. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that these CD8 T-cells from LTNP, but not from HLA-B27 or HLA-B57 progressors, can cross-react with intermediate escape mutations, preventing full escape via compensatory mutations. Humoral immunity appears to play little part in LTNP subjects, since broadly neutralizing antibodies are rare, even amongst slow progressors. Recent genome-wide comparisons between LTNP and progressors have confirmed the HLA-B57, HLA-B27, and delta32 CCR5 allelic associations, plus indicated a role for HLA-C/KIR interactions, but have not revealed any new genotypes so far. Nevertheless, it is hoped that studying the mechanisms of intracellular restriction factors, such as the recently identified SAMHD1, will lead to a better understanding of non-progression.","2013","2013","John Zaunders; David van Bockel","Centre for Applied Medical Research, St Vincent's Hospital Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."

The unique availability of SIV infected rhesus macaques (RM) classified as Elite Controllers (EC), and those with Low, Intermediate and High Viral Loads (HVL) provided a unique opportunity to address this issue. Results of these studies showed that EC demonstrated a remarkable ability to reverse changes that are induced acutely by SIV in the various cell lineages.

Moreover, the acute phase of infection represents a proper scenario to delineate the antiviral cellular functions that best correlate with control. Here, multiple functional aspects (specificity, ex vivo viral inhibitory activity [VIA] and polyfunctionality) of the HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell subset arising early after infection, and their association with disease progression markers, were examined. Blood samples from 44 subjects recruited within 6 months from infection (primary HIV infection [PHI] group), 16 chronically infected subjects, 11 elite controllers (EC), and 10 healthy donors were obtained. Results indicated that, although Nef dominated the anti-HIV response during acute/early infection, a higher proportion of early anti-Gag T cells correlated with delayed progression. Polyfunctional HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected at early time points but did not associate with virus control. Conversely, higher CD4(+) T-cell set points were observed in PHI subjects with higher HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell VIA at baseline. Importantly, VIA levels correlated with the magnitude of the anti-Gag cellular response. The advantage of Gag-specific cells may result from their enhanced ability to mediate lysis of infected cells (evidenced by a higher capacity to degranulate and to mediate VIA) and to simultaneously produce IFN-γ. Finally, Gag immunodominance was associated with elevated plasma levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1β (MIP-1β). All together, this study underscores the importance of CD8(+) T-cell specificity in the improved control of disease progression, which was related to the capacity of Gag-specific cells to mediate both lytic and nonlytic antiviral mechanisms at early time points postinfection.","2013","2013 Jul","Gabriela Turk; Yanina Ghiglione; Juliana Falivene; María Eugenia Socias; Natalia Laufer; Romina Soledad Coloccini; Ana María Rodriguez; María Julia Ruiz; María Ángeles Pando; Luis David Giavedoni; Pedro Cahn; Omar Sued; Horacio Salomon; María Magdalena Gherardi","Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), Universidad de Buenos Aires-CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina. gturk@fmed.uba.ar"

Starting from the well-known impact of humoral immunity in HIV infection, there is still a lack of knowledge in defining the role of the modulation of functional activity and titers of serum antibodies from early stage of infection to the development of AIDS. We propose an integrated approach that combines humoral and clinical parameters in defining the host immunity, implementing algorithms associated with virus control. A number of humoral parameters were simultaneously evaluated in a whole range of serum samples from HIV-positive patients. This issue has been afforded accounting for estimation problems typically related to ""feasibility"" studies where small sample size in each group and large number of parameters are jointly estimated. We used nonparametric statistical procedures to identify biomarkers in our study which included 42 subjects stratified on five different stages of HIV infection, i.e., Elite Controllers (EC), Long Term Non Progressors (LTNP), HAART, AIDS and Acute Infection (AI). The main goal of the paper is to illustrate a novel profiling method for helping to design a further confirmatory study.

Longitudinal analysis of chronically infected persons starting ART revealed that the frequency of HIV-specific T cells prone to death decreased, suggesting that this phenotype is partially reversible even though it never achieves the levels present in EC. Elucidating the apoptotic factors contributing to the survival of CTL in EC is paramount to our development of effective HIV-1 vaccines. Furthermore, a better understanding of cellular markers that can be utilized to predict response durability in disease- or vaccine-elicited responses will advance the field.","2013","2013 May","Jiyu Yan; Steffanie Sabbaj; Anju Bansal; Nilesh Amatya; John J Shacka; Paul A Goepfert; Sonya L Heath","Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA."

Viral loads were assessed by bDNA and RT-PCR assays and if below 100 copies (cps)/mL, by Ultrio limiting dilution probit analysis. The probability of virus transmission by WP and EC donations was estimated for different levels of the 50% minimum infectious dose (ID50 ) using Poisson distribution statistics. The equal distribution of WP donations plotted by log HIV-RNA levels indicated a random appearance of donors in the ramp-up phase. The HIV p24 Ag assay detected 45% of WP samples and the cutoff crossing point was estimated at 8140 (bDNA)/22,710 (RT-PCR) cps/mL. On replicate retesting of 40 HIV p24 Ag-negative ID-NAT WP-yield samples Ultrio minipool (MP)8, Ultrio-Plus MP8, and TaqScreen MP6 detected 79, 81, and 78%, respectively. Modeling with an estimated ID50 of 31.6 virions/RBC indicated that 15% of p24 Ag-negative ID-NAT WP-yield donations would have transmitted HIV if MP6-8 NAT had been used. Only 2% of RBC transfusions from ECs are estimated to be infectious with a worst-case ID50 estimate of 316 virions. Our analysis of viremia and infectivity of WP and EC donations enables comparison of the efficacy of NAT options in preventing HIV transmission risk.","2013","2013 Oct","Marion Vermeulen; Charl Coleman; Josephine Mitchel; Ravi Reddy; Harry van Drimmelen; Tracy Fickett; Michael Busch; Nico Lelie","South African National Blood Service (SANBS), Johannesburg, South Africa; BioQControl, DDL Laboratories, Rijswijk, Netherlands; Creative Testing Solutions, Tampa, Florida; Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California; Lelie Research Paris, Paris, France."

All samples were collected from adults in the US who were HIV infected for >2 years. Samples were tested with the BED capture enzyme immunoassay (BED-CEIA) which measures the proportion of IgG that is HIV-specific, and with an antibody avidity assay based on the Genetic Systems 1/2+ O ELISA.

For elite suppressors, 10/18 had BED-CEIA values <0.8 normalized optical density units (OD-n) and these values did not change significantly over time. For patients receiving ART, 14/18 had BED-CEIA values that decreased over time, with a median decrease of 0.42 OD-n (range 0.10 to 0.63)/time point receiving ART. Three patterns of BED-CEIA values were observed during viral breakthrough: (1) values that increased then returned to pre-breakthrough values when viral suppression was re-established, (2) values that increased after viral breakthrough, and (3) values that did not change with viral breakthrough. Viral suppression and viral breakthrough were associated with changes in BED-CEIA values, reflecting changes in the proportion of HIV-specific IgG. These changes can result in misclassification of patients with long-term HIV infection as recently infected using the BED-CEIA, thereby influencing a falsely high value for cross-sectional incidence estimates.","2013","2013","Sarah K Wendel; Caroline E Mullis; Susan H Eshleman; Joel N Blankson; Richard D Moore; Jeanne C Keruly; Ron Brookmeyer; Thomas C Quinn; Oliver Laeyendecker","Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."

To investigate the mechanism for this antiviral immune response, we performed gene expression analyses on primary CD4(+) cells that were exposed to HIV-suppressing CD8(+) cells or CD8(+) cell-conditioned medium having HIV-suppressing activity. These experiments revealed increased levels of multiple genes stimulated by type I interferons (IFN; eg, IFN-α and IFN-β). Further evaluation revealed that primary CD8(+) cells, particularly those from elite controllers and other asymptomatic HIV-1-infected individuals, secrete IFN, and this response directly contributes to the in vitro suppression of HIV replication in CD4(+) cells.

As slower HIV disease progression is associated with high levels of antibodies to HIV Gag proteins, we have examined antibodies to HIV proteins in controllers with and without 'protective' HLA-B alleles. Plasma from 32 HIV controllers and 21 noncontrollers was examined for immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG2 antibodies to HIV proteins in virus lysates by western blot assay and to recombinant (r) p55 and gp140 by ELISA. Natural killer (NK) cell-activating antibodies and FcγRIIa-binding immune complexes were also assessed. Plasma levels of IgG1 antibodies to HIV Gag (p18, p24, rp55) and Pol-encoded (p32, p51, p66) proteins were higher in HIV controllers. In contrast, IgG1 antibodies to Env proteins were less discriminatory, with only antigp120 levels being higher in controllers. High-level IgG2 antibodies to any Gag protein were most common in HIV controllers not carrying a 'protective' HLA-B allele, particularly HLA-B*57 (P = 0.016). HIV controllers without 'protective' HLA-B alleles also had higher plasma levels of IgG1 antip32 (P = 0.04). NK cell-activating antibodies to gp140 Env protein were higher in elite controllers but did not differentiate HIV controllers with or without 'protective' HLA-B alleles. IgG1 was increased in FcγRIIa-binding immune complexes from noncontrollers.

B-cell phenotype and correlating factors were evaluated. Variations in B-cell subsets were evaluated by flow cytometry in HIV-1-infected individuals naive to therapy, elite controllers, and patients treated with antiretroviral drugs (virological control or failure). Multivariable analysis was performed to identify variables independently associated with the B-cell alterations. Significant differences were observed among patients' groups in relation to all B-cell subsets. Resting memory B cells were preserved in patients naive to therapy and elite controllers, but reduced in treated patients. Individuals naive to therapy and experiencing multidrug failure, as well as elite controllers, had significantly higher levels of activated memory B cells compared to healthy controls. In the multivariate analysis, plasma viral load and nadir CD4 T cells independently correlated with major B-cell alterations. Coinfection with hepatitis C but not hepatitis B virus also showed an impact on specific B-cell subsets. Successful protracted antiretroviral treatment led to normalization of all B-cell subsets with exception of resting memory B cells.

Cell surface molecules are important for immunological functions and changes in expression can affect lymphocyte effector functions, thereby contributing to pathogenesis and disease progression. In this study we have focused on CD96, a member of the IgG superfamily receptors that have generated increasing recent interest due to their adhesive and co-stimulatory functions in addition to immunoregulatory capacity. CD96 is expressed by both T and NK cells. Although the function of CD96 is not completely elucidated, it has been shown to have adhesive functions and enhance cytotoxicity. Interestingly, CD96 may also have inhibitory functions due to its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). The clinical significance of CD96 is still comparatively limited although it has been associated with chronic Hepatitis B infection and disease progression. CD96 has not previously been studied in the context of HIV-1 infection, but due to its potential importance in immune regulation and relevance to chronic disease, we examined CD96 expression in relation to HIV-1 pathogenesis. In a cross-sectional analysis, we investigated the CD8(+) T cell expression of CD96 in cohorts of untreated HIV-1 infected adults with high viral loads (non-controllers) and low viral loads (""elite"" controllers). We demonstrated that elite controllers have significantly higher CD96 mean fluorescence intensity on CD8(+) T cells compared to HIV-1 non-controllers and CD96 expression was positively associated with CD4(+) T cell counts. Functional assessment showed that CD8(+) T cells lacking CD96 expression represented a population that produced both perforin and IFN-γ following stimulation. Furthermore, CD96 expression on CD8(+) T cells was decreased in presence of lipopolysaccharide in vitro. Overall, these findings indicate that down-regulation of CD96 is an important aspect of HIV-1 pathogenesis and differential expression is related to cell effector functions and HIV-1 disease course.","2012","2012","Emily M Eriksson; Chris E Keh; Steven G Deeks; Jeffrey N Martin; Frederick M Hecht; Douglas F Nixon","Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America. eriksson@wehi.edu.au"

We analysed paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples using a highly sensitive assay for HIV-1 RNA quantification. We analysed 28 CSF samples and 27 concurrent plasma samples from 14 elite controllers with the highly sensitive single-copy assay (SCA) that allows for HIV-1 RNA quantification down to less than one copy of HIV-1 RNA per millilitre. Three samples were excluded because of internal standard failure.

HIV-1 RNA could not be detected in CSF in most elite controllers using the highly sensitive SCA, and when detected, it was at significantly lower frequencies and concentrations than in plasma.

We analyzed a small cohort of elite controllers (ECs) for HIV-neutralizing antibodies using a panel of standardized HIV-1 pseudovirions on TZM-bl cells. An HIV-1 Env-tailored phage display library was generated to select epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies in the EC26 plasma sample showing the broadest neutralizing activity. Selected Env fragments were mostly allocated to the membrane proximal external region of gp41. After preabsorbing the EC26 plasma with the selected phage EC26-2A4, we achieved 50% depletion of its neutralizing activity. Furthermore, antibodies affinity-purified with the EC26-2A4 epitope from EC26 plasma showed neutralizing activity, proving that the selected phage indeed contains an epitope targeted by neutralizing plasma antibodies. Epitope fine mapping of the purified plasma antibodies on peptide arrays identified a new epitope overlapping, but clearly distinct, from the prominent 2F5 epitope. Of note, the purified antibodies did not show autoreactivity with cardiolipin, whereas low reactivity with phosphatidylserine comparable to mAb 2F5 was observed.

In order to evaluate whether HIV-1 vif alterations account for a delayed progression to AIDS in children infected perinatally, the vif genes from a group of 11 patients who exhibited an extremely slow disease progression (slow progressors) were studied by direct sequencing. In addition, the vif genes from a group of 93 children with typical disease progression (typical progressors) were analyzed for comparison. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that sequences from slow progressors did not have a common origin, discarding a shared ancestor of reduced virulence. There were no differences in the diversity between the vif genes from slow and typical progressors. No gross defects showing a clear distinction among sequences from both groups of children were found. However, in the deduced Vif proteins, changes V13I, V55T, and L81M were observed only in sequences from slow progressors. By analyzing sequences stored in databases, these mutations were determined as unusual substitutions occurring at highly conserved Vif sites across different HIV-1 clades, but were observed with an increased frequency in sequences from elite controllers. These mutations were in the Vif regions reported as relevant for protein activity. These findings suggest that the Vif sequences from slow progressors carry unusual substitutions, which may alter the protein function and may contribute to viral attenuation.","2012","2012 Dec","Federico A De Maio; Carlos A Rocco; Paula C Aulicino; Rosa Bologna; Andrea Mangano; Luisa Sen","Cellular Biology and Retroviruses Laboratory-CONICET, Juan P.

A few HIV-infected individuals termed elite controllers (EC) maintain polyfunctional HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells, minimal HIV replication and normal CD4(+) T lymphocyte numbers. Thus, therapeutic intervention to sustain or restore CD8(+) T cell responses similar to those persisting in EC could relieve terminal dependence on antiretrovirals. Vaccination with HIV peptides is one approach to achieve this and our objective in this study was to determine whether certain HIV peptide variants display antigenic superiority over the reference peptides normally included in vaccines. Eight peptide sets were generated, each with a reference peptide and six variants harboring conservative or semi-conservative amino acid substitutions at positions predicted to affect T cell receptor interactions without affecting human class I histocompatibililty-linked antigen (HLA) binding. Recognition across peptide sets was tested with >80 HIV-infected individuals bearing the appropriate HLA alleles. While reference peptides were often the most antigenic, cross-reactivity with variants was common and in many cases, peptide variants were superior at stimulating interferon-γ production or selectively enhanced interleukin-2 production. Although such heteroclitic activity was not generalized for all individuals bearing the HLA class I allele involved, these data suggest that heteroclitic peptide variants could improve the efficacy of therapeutic peptide vaccines in HIV infection.","2012","2012 Nov 19","Krista H Gladney; Julia Pohling; Natasha A Hollett; Katrin Zipperlen; Maureen E Gallant; Michael D Grant","Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador, St. John's, NL, Canada A1B 3V6. kristagladney@hotmail.com"

Understanding the mechanisms by which ES control viral replication may prove informative for the design of a therapeutic vaccine. Qualitative differences in the CD8(+) T cell response have been implicated in control. Therefore, we isolated CD8(+) T cells from ES and characterized the ability of sorted memory and activation subpopulations to control viral replication at various effector-to-target cell ratios using a novel modification of a CD8(+) T cell suppression assay. The effector memory and terminal effector subpopulations of memory CD8(+) T cells had the highest inhibitory potential over the course of a 3-day in vitro infection. Interestingly, after 5 days of infection, central memory CD8(+) T cells were also very effective at suppressing viral replication. No significant correlation between the suppression of viral replication and the number of HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells was observed. HLA-DR(-) CD38(+) CD8(+) T cells possessed the lowest inhibitory potential of the activation subpopulations. Taken together, our data suggest that there are key differences in the magnitude and kinetics of the suppression of HIV-1 replication by different CD8(+) T cell subsets.

Most of these elite controllers express the histocompatibility alleles HLA-B*57 or HLA-B*27 (ref. 3). These alleles remain by far the most robust associations with low concentrations of plasma virus, yet the mechanism of control in these individuals is not entirely clear. Here we vaccinate Indian rhesus macaques that express Mamu-B*08, an animal model for HLA-B*27-mediated elite control, with three Mamu-B*08-restricted CD8(+) T-cell epitopes, and demonstrate that these vaccinated animals control replication of the highly pathogenic clonal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) mac239 virus. High frequencies of CD8(+) T cells against these Vif and Nef epitopes in the blood, lymph nodes and colon were associated with viral control. Moreover, the frequency of the CD8(+) T-cell response against the Nef RL10 epitope (Nef amino acids 137-146) correlated significantly with reduced acute phase viraemia. Finally, two of the eight vaccinees lost control of viral replication in the chronic phase, concomitant with escape in all three targeted epitopes, further implicating these three CD8(+) T-cell responses in the control of viral replication. Our findings indicate that narrowly targeted vaccine-induced virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses can control replication of the AIDS virus.","2012","2012 Nov 01","Philip A Mudd; Mauricio A Martins; Adam J Ericsen; Damien C Tully; Karen A Power; Alex T Bean; Shari M Piaskowski; Lijie Duan; Aaron Seese; Adrianne D Gladden; Kim L Weisgrau; Jessica R Furlott; Young-il Kim; Marlon G Veloso de Santana; Eva Rakasz; Saverio Capuano; Nancy A Wilson; Myrna C Bonaldo; Ricardo Galler; David B Allison; Michael Piatak; Ashley T Haase; Jeffrey D Lifson; Todd M Allen; David I Watkins","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53711, USA."

However, the intersubtype differences in the replicative consequences of such mutations have not been explored. In HIV-1 subtype B, the p24(Gag) M250I mutation is a rare variant (0.6%) that is enriched among elite controllers (7.2%) (P = 0.0005) and appears to be a rare escape variant selected by HLA-B58 supertype alleles (P < 0.01). In contrast, in subtype C, it is a relatively common minor polymorphic variant (10 to 15%) whose appearance is not associated with a particular HLA allele. Using site-directed mutant viruses, we demonstrate that M250I reduces in vitro viral replicative capacity in both subtype B and subtype C sequences. However, whereas in subtype C downstream compensatory mutations at p24(Gag) codons 252 and 260 reduce the adverse effects of M250I, fitness costs in subtype B appear difficult to restore. Indeed, patient-derived subtype B sequences harboring M250I exhibited in vitro replicative defects, while those from subtype C did not. The structural implications of M250I were predicted by protein modeling to be greater in subtype B versus C, providing a potential explanation for its lower frequency and enhanced replicative defects in subtype B. In addition to accounting for genetic differences between HIV-1 subtypes, the design of cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-based vaccines may need to account for differential effects of host-driven viral evolution on viral fitness.","2012","2012 Dec","Denis R Chopera; Laura A Cotton; Alexander Zawaira; Jaclyn K Mann; Nobubelo K Ngandu; Roman Ntale; Jonathan M Carlson; Koleka Mlisana; Zenda Woodman; Debra de Assis Rosa; Eric Martin; Toshiyuki Miura; Florencia Pereyra; Bruce D Walker; Clive M Gray; Darren P Martin; Thumbi Ndung'u; Mark A Brockman; Salim Abdool Karim; Zabrina L Brumme; Carolyn Williamson; ","Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, and the Division of Medical Virology, University of Cape Town and National Health Laboratory Services, Cape Town, South Africa."

It has been proposed that elite controllers benefit from being infected with attenuated human immunodeficiency virus-1 variants. A 31-year-old African woman presented with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection during pregnancy and was diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Subsequently, her husband, a 31-year-old African man, was tested and found to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus-1. His plasma human immunodeficiency virus-1 ribonucleic acid level was found to be below the limit of detection of the clinical assay. This report provides evidence for the first described case of human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection possibly transmitted from an elite controller to a patient who progressed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

However, a comparative analysis of the genotype and function of the innate and adaptive immune compartments in HIV-1-infected controller individuals has been understudied to date. Here, we simultaneously tested NK and T-cell function in controllers to investigate the mechanism(s) that might account for host immune control over viral replication. We measured CD8 T-cell responses against HIV-1 utilizing overlapping 15-mer peptides spanning the HIV-1 consensus clade B Gag protein and tested NK cell degranulation and cytokine secretion against tumor target cells following interferon-α (IFNα) stimulation. Among a cohort of 37 controllers, the presence of protective major histocompatibility complex class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles (such as HLA-B*57) was not correlated with HIV-specific CD8 responses. In contrast, the inheritance of a protective killer inhibitory receptor KIR3DL1*h/*y receptor genotype along with the corresponding HLA-Bw4*80I ligand was associated with significantly heightened target cell-induced NK degranulation and cytokine secretion following IFNα stimulation (P = 0.0201, n = 13).

Of the 59 patients currently in the NVS cohort, 45.8% have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, thereby presenting a unique opportunity to study immune activation and the interaction between HCV and HIV. NVS with chronic HCV infection had elevated levels of immune activation (CD38-positive HLA-DR-positive CD8 cells) compared to NVS without chronic HCV (P = 0.004). The increased levels of immune activation were not associated with sex, HLA B57 status, or injection drug use use. NVS patients with chronic HCV had lower mean CD4 cell counts, CD4 percentage, and CD4/CD8 ratios than NVS without chronic HCV infection (P = 0.038, P = 0.008, and P = 0.048, respectively). The difference in CD4 cell count appeared to occur early in HIV infection with no difference observed in CD4 slopes between groups.

This study suggests a relationship between HCV infection, immune activation, and CD4 cell counts in the NVS, with chronic HCV infection associated with lower CD4 cell counts and higher levels of immune activation.

Four patients, hereafter referred to as secondary controllers (SC), were identified who initiated therapy during chronic infection and, after stopping treatment, could control virus replication at undetectable levels for more than six months. In the present study we set out to unravel possible viral and immune parameters or mechanisms of this phenomenon by comparing secondary controllers with elite controllers and non-controllers, including patients under HAART. As candidate correlates of protection, virus growth kinetics, levels of intracellular viral markers, several aspects of HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell function and HIV neutralizing antibodies were investigated. As expected all intracellular viral markers were lower in aviremic as compared to viremic subjects, but in addition both elite and secondary controllers had lower levels of viral unspliced RNA in PBMC as compared to patients on HAART. Ex vivo cultivation of the virus from CD4+ T cells of SC consistently failed in one patient and showed delayed kinetics in the three others. Formal in vitro replication studies of these three viruses showed low to absent growth in two cases and a virus with normal fitness in the third case. T cell responses toward HIV peptides, evaluated in IFN-γ ELISPOT, revealed no significant differences in breadth, magnitude or avidity between SC and all other patient groups. Neither was there a difference in polyfunctionality of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, as evaluated with intracellular cytokine staining. However, secondary and elite controllers showed higher proliferative responses to Gag and Pol peptides. SC also showed the highest level of autologous neutralizing antibodies. These data suggest that higher T cell proliferative responses and lower replication kinetics might be instrumental in secondary viral control in the absence of treatment.","2012","2012","Ellen Van Gulck; Lotte Bracke; Leo Heyndrickx; Sandra Coppens; Derek Atkinson; Céline Merlin; Alexander Pasternak; Eric Florence; Guido Vanham","Virology Unit, Microbiology Group, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium. evangulck@hotmail.com"

These have resulted in the identification of HIV elite controllers with low or absent responses in which non-T-cell mechanisms of control have been suggested. However, successful control of HIV infection may be associated with central memory T cells, which have not been consistently examined in these individuals. Gag-specific T cells were characterized using a peptide-based cultured enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISpot). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV elite controllers (n = 10), progressors (n = 12), and antiretroviral-treated individuals (n = 9) were cultured with overlapping peptides for 12 days. Specificity was assessed by tetramer staining, functional features of expanded cells were assessed by cytokine secretion, and virus inhibition and phenotypic characteristics were assessed by cell sorting and coculture assays. After peptide stimulation, elite controllers showed a greater number of previously undetectable (new) responses compared to progressors (P = 0.0008). These responses were highly polyfunctional, with 64.5% of responses having 3 to 5 functions. Expandable epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells from elite controllers had strong virus inhibitory capacity and predominantly displayed a central memory phenotype. These data indicate that elite controllers with minimal T cell responses harbor a highly functional, broadly directed central memory T cell population that is capable of suppressing HIV in vitro. Comprehensive examination of this cell population could provide insight into the immune responses associated with successful containment of viremia.","2012","2012 Jun","Zaza M Ndhlovu; Jacqueline Proudfoot; Kevin Cesa; Donna Marie Alvino; Ashley McMullen; Seanna Vine; Eleni Stampouloglou; Alicja Piechocka-Trocha; Bruce D Walker; Florencia Pereyra","Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."

All 4 had at least one protective HLA allele and CD8(+) T-cell responses that were disproportionately high for the low antigen levels but comparatively lower than those of typical LTNPs/ECs. These unique persons exhibit extraordinary suppression over HIV replication, therefore, higher-level control than has been demonstrated in previous studies of LTNPs/ECs.

These data suggest that some viremic controllers and elite suppressors are infected with HIV-1 isolates that replicate vigorously in vitro and are able to cause progressive disease in vivo.

We followed both the immune response and viral evolution in SIV-infected Mamu-B*00801(+) animals to better understand the role of CD8(+) T lymphocytes during the acute phase of viral infection, when viral control status is determined. The virus escaped from immunodominant Vif and Nef Mamu-B*00801-restricted CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses during the critical early weeks of acute infection only in progressor animals that did not control viral replication. Thus, early CD8(+) T lymphocyte escape is a hallmark of Mamu-B*00801(+) macaques who do not control viral replication.

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 35 kb upstream of the HLA-C gene locus (-35C/T) was previously shown to correlate with increased HLA-C expression and improved control of HIV-1. Here, we genotyped the -35C/T SNP in 639 subjects (180 uninfected patients, 304 HIV progressors and 155 LTNP) and confirmed the association of the -35C/T variant with the LTNP phenotype. The genotype frequencies in the general population subjects did not differ significantly from those seen in HIV progressors (p-value=0.472). However, a significant higher frequency of the protective CC genotype was identified when LTNP were compared either with HIV progressors alone (p-value<0.0001) or progressors and uninfected subjects together (p-value<0.0001). When considering aviremic LTNP alone (elite controllers; viral load below 50 copies/ml), the -35 CC genotype was not overrepresented compared to HIV progressors. Conversely, a significant association was found with the viremic LTNP groups (viral loads below 10,000 copies/ml). These results suggest that other factors alone or in combination with the -35 CC genotype may play an important role in differentiating the elite controller status from LTNP.

Adaptive immunity and host genetic factors, although implicated, do not entirely explain this phenomenon. On the other hand, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the principal type I interferon (IFN) producers in response to viral infection, and it is unknown whether pDCs are involved in the control of HIV infection in EC. In our study, we analyzed peripheral pDC levels and IFN-α production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in EC compared to other groups of HIV-infected patients, the ability of pDCs to reduce HIV production in vitro, and the mechanisms potentially involved. We showed preserved pDC counts and IFN-α production in EC. We also observed a higher capacity of pDCs from EC to reduce HIV production and to induce T cell apoptosis, whereas pDCs from viremic patients barely responded without previous Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) stimulus. The preserved functionality of pDCs from EC to reduce viral production may be one of the mechanisms involved in the control of HIV viremia in these subjects.

However, a subset of elite controllers has progressive CD4 T-cell losses despite undetectable viral loads, for reasons that remain undefined. Here, we assessed mechanisms of CD4 T-cell homeostasis in elite controllers with progressive vs. nonprogressive HIV-1 disease courses. Flow cytometry assays were used to determine the proliferation, activation and apoptosis levels of naive T cells in elite controllers with high or low CD4 T-cell counts and reference cohorts of HIV-1-negative and HAART-treated persons. Thymic output was measured by single-joint T-cell receptor excision circle (sjTREC)/β T-cell receptor excision circle (βTREC) ratios, and the frequency of circulating recent thymic emigrants was flow cytometrically determined by surface expression of protein tyrosine kinase 7. Proportions of naive T cells in elite controllers were severely reduced and closely resemble those of HIV-1 patients with progressive disease. Despite reductions in naive T cells, most elite controllers were able to maintain normal total CD4 T-cell counts by preservation of uncompromised thymic function in conjunction with extrathymic processes that led to elevated levels of circulating recent thymic emigrants. In contrast, elite controllers with low CD4 T-cell counts had reduced thymic output that mirrored thymic dysfunction during untreated progressive HIV-1 infection. These results indicate that both thymic and extrathymic mechanisms contribute to CD4 T-cell maintenance in elite controllers and support the idea that CD4 T-cell homeostasis and control of viral replication are distinct but frequently coinciding processes.","2012","2012 Mar 27","Yue Yang; Maha Al-Mozaini; Maria J Buzon; Jill Beamon; Sara Ferrando-Martinez; Ezequiel Ruiz-Mateos; Eric S Rosenberg; Florencia Pereyra; Xu G Yu; Mathias Lichterfeld","Infectious Disease Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA."

We performed a comprehensive evaluation of inflammation and T-cell activation in a demographically unique cohort of HIV controllers and noncontrollers. Plasma concentrations of 22 cytokines and chemokines were evaluated using a multiplex bead array approach. Multicolor flow cytometry was used to measure baseline levels of T-cell activation and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and HIV-specific T-cell cytokine (interferon γ, interleukin 2) and proliferation responses. HIV controllers were characterized by elevated macrophage inflammatory protein 1α and low levels of interferon γ-induced protein 10, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and Transforming growth factor beta. Activated (CD38(+) HLA DR(+)) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were reduced in HIV controllers relative to noncontrollers. HIV controllers and noncontrollers had comparable proportions of Tregs within the CD4(+) T-cell compartment, but absolute Treg counts were depleted in noncontrollers. Absolute Treg counts correlated inversely with T-cell activation. Proliferative CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses directed against HIV gag epitopes were found most frequently among HIV controllers with the lowest viral loads (elite controllers) and were rarely detected among noncontrollers, supporting a relationship between HIV-specific T-cell proliferation and viral control. Collectively, these data suggest a model in which HIV controllers maintain low levels of viral replication through robust HIV-specific T-cell responses in an environment of low inflammation and reduced availability of activated target cells.","2012","2012 Apr 15","Catherine M Card; Yoav Keynan; Julie Lajoie; Courtney P Bell; Magdy Dawood; Marissa Becker; Ken Kasper; Keith R Fowke","Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."

Mechanisms related to this spontaneous control of viral replication are poorly understood. The study included HIV-1 controllers (patients with at least 1 year of HIV-1 diagnosis, highly active antiretroviral therapy naive, and with viral loads less than 2000 copies/mL) and HIV-1 progressors without antiretroviral therapy (viral load >2500 copies/mL, and CD4 T-cell count >250 cells/μL at the time of sampling). The expression of soluble factors, leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) and human α-defensins-1 (HAD-1), was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction from neutrophil cultures with or without HIV stimulation; the frequency and phenotype of innate and adaptive immune cells were determined by flow cytometry, and frequency of human leukocyte antigen alleles was determined by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific oligonucleotide typing. As expected, HIV-1 controllers had higher CD4 T-cell counts and lower viral load when compared with HIV-1 progressor individuals; in addition, they exhibited lower expression of activation markers, higher frequency of myeloid dendritic cell, lower percentage of regulatory T cells and natural killer cells, and higher expression of SLPI. All together, these findings suggest that the control of the immune activation status and the production of antiviral proteins by innate immune cells could be associated to the mechanisms involved in the control of HIV-1 replication and better preservation of the CD4 T-cell count.","2012","2012 May 01","Natalia A Taborda; Juan C Cataño; Julio C Delgado; María T Rugeles; Carlos J Montoya","Immunovirology Group, School of Medicine, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia."

The mechanisms of suppression are incompletely understood. Modulation of HIV-1 replication by miRNAs has been reported, but the role of small RNAs in ES is unknown. Using samples from a well-characterized ES cohort, untreated viremic patients, and uninfected controls, we explored the PBMC miRNA profile and probed the relationships of miRNA expression, CD4+ T-cell counts, and viral load. miRNA profiles, obtained using multiple acquisition, data processing, and analysis methods, distinguished ES and uninfected controls from viremic HIV-1-infected patients. For several miRNAs, however, ES and viremic patients shared similar expression patterns. Differentially expressed miRNAs included those with reported roles in HIV-1 latency (miR-29 family members, miRs -125b and -150). Others, such as miR-31 and miR-31*, had no previously reported connection with HIV-1 infection but were found here to differ significantly with uncontrolled HIV-1 replication. Correlations of miRNA expression with CD4+ T-cell count and viral load were found, and we observed that ES with low CD4+ T-cell counts had miRNA profiles more closely related to viremic patients than controls. However, expression patterns indicate that miRNA variability cannot be explained solely by CD4+ T-cell variation. The intimate involvement of miRNAs in disease processes is underscored by connections of miRNA expression with the HIV disease clinical parameters of CD4 count and plasma viral load. However, miRNA profile changes are not explained completely by these variables. Significant declines of miRs-125b and -150, among others, in both ES and viremic patients indicate the persistence of host miRNA responses or ongoing effects of infection despite viral suppression by ES. We found no negative correlations with viral load in viremic patients, not even those that have been reported to silence HIV-1 in vitro, suggesting that the effects of these miRNAs are exerted in a focused, cell-type-specific manner. Finally, the observation that some ES with low CD4 counts were consistently related to viremic patients suggests that miRNAs may serve as biomarkers for risk of disease progression even in the presence of viral suppression.","2012","2012 Jan 12","Kenneth W Witwer; Andria K Watson; Joel N Blankson; Janice E Clements","Department of Molecular and Comparative Pathobiology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 733 North Broadway, Baltimore, Maryland 21025, USA. kwitwer1@jhmi.edu"

CD100 has important immune regulatory functions that improve antigen-specific priming by antigen-presenting cells, and can also act as a costimulatory molecule on T cells. We investigated the consequence of HIV-1 infection on CD100 expression by T cells, and whether CD100 expression signifies functionally competent effector cells. CD100 expression on T cells from healthy individuals was compared with HIV-1-infected subjects including elite controllers, noncontrollers, and patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The frequency and fluorescence intensity of CD100 on CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells were decreased during HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, the absolute number of CD100-expressing CD8(+) T cells was positively associated with the magnitude of HIV-1-specific T-cell responses. CD8(+) T cells lacking CD100 expression were functionally impaired and present in increased numbers in HIV-1-infected individuals. The number of CD100(-)CD8(+) T cells positively correlated with T-cell immunosenescence, immune activation, and viral load. Loss of CD100 expression appears to result from direct antigen stimulation, as in vitro cytokine exposure and viral replication did not significantly impact CD100 expression. These data suggest that loss of CD100 expression probably plays an important role in dysfunctional immunity in HIV-1 infection.","2012","2012 Jan 19","Emily M Eriksson; Jeffrey M Milush; Emily L Ho; Mariana D Batista; Sara J Holditch; Chris E Keh; Philip J Norris; Sheila M Keating; Steven G Deeks; Peter W Hunt; Jeffrey N Martin; Michael G Rosenberg; Frederick M Hecht; Douglas F Nixon","Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California–San Francisco, USA. erikssonemy@gmail.com"

The objective of this study was to distinguish immune signatures in HIV controllers and progressors, by evaluating tolerogenic and immunogenic factors in untreated HIV-1 infected individuals. The recruited population was divided into putative elite controllers (PEC), long-term non-progressors (LTNP), normal progressors (NP) and fast progressors (FP). The proportion of regulatory T cells [T(regs) , CD4+ CD25+ forkhead box P3 (FoxP3+)], programmed death (PD)-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-inhibitory molecules and CD40L, CD69 and Ki67 activation markers were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by flow cytometry. Significant differences were found between HIV controllers and HIV progressors, with up-regulation of T(regs) , PD-1 and CTLA-4 and decrease of CD40L expression in progressors compared with controllers. Expression of CD40L and concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, CCL-3, and CCL-4 were significantly higher in PEC and LTNP than in NP and FP. In an attempt to convert immune signatures of progressors to those of controllers, seven agents were used to stimulate PBMC from the four cohorts. Treatment with CD40L and IL-4 or PD-1 antibodies in vitro were most effective in converting the immune signatures of progressors to those observed in controllers by down-regulating T(regs) and up-regulating CD40L expression in CD4+ T cells. The conversion concept merits translation to in vivo immune control of HIV infection.","2011","2011 Nov","T Whittall; B Peters; D Rahman; C I Kingsley; R Vaughan; T Lehner","Mucosal Immunology Unit, Kings College London, Guy's Hospital, London, UK."

The frequency of the CC genotype was 12.5% in the NVS, 14.7% in the LVL (""low viral load"" cohort with 400-20,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL), 17.8% in the MHVL (""medium/high viral load"" cohort with >20,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL), and 11.6% in an HIV-negative cohort. There was no statistical significance in the CC genotype distribution between these cohorts (p= 0.48 between the NVS and non-NVS HIV positive controls, p= 0.85 between NVS and HIV-negatives). We also did not observe any association between CC genotype distribution and HIV RNA viral load, as a continuous measure.

However, limitations have prevented a clear understanding of the mechanisms of elite controlled infection, as these studies can only be performed at randomly selected late time points in infection, after control is achieved, and the access to tissues is limited. We report that SIVagm infection is elite-controlled in rhesus macaques (RMs) and therefore can be used as an animal model for EC HIV infection. A robust acute infection, with high levels of viral replication and dramatic mucosal CD4(+) T cell depletion, similar to pathogenic HIV-1/SIV infections of humans and RMs, was followed by complete and durable control of SIVagm replication, defined as: undetectable VLs in blood and tissues beginning 72 to 90 days postinoculation (pi) and continuing at least 4 years; seroreversion; progressive recovery of mucosal CD4(+) T cells, with complete recovery by 4 years pi; normal levels of T cell immune activation, proliferation, and apoptosis; and no disease progression. This ""functional cure"" of SIVagm infection in RMs could be reverted after 4 years of control of infection by depleting CD8 cells, which resulted in transient rebounds of VLs, thus suggesting that control may be at least in part immune mediated. Viral control was independent of MHC, partial APOBEC restriction was not involved in SIVagm control in RMs and Trim5 genotypes did not impact viral replication. This new animal model of EC lentiviral infection, in which complete control can be predicted in all cases, permits research on the early events of infection in blood and tissues, before the defining characteristics of EC are evident and when host factors are actively driving the infection towards the EC status.","2011","2011 Aug","Ivona Pandrea; Thaidra Gaufin; Rajeev Gautam; Jan Kristoff; Daniel Mandell; David Montefiori; Brandon F Keele; Ruy M Ribeiro; Ronald S Veazey; Cristian Apetrei","Division of Comparative Pathology, Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, Louisiana, United States of America."

This indicates that chromosomal HIV-1 integration is inhibited in ex vivo-infected CD4 T cells from elite controllers. This defect in HIV-1 integration was unrelated to p21, a host protein that can restrict early HIV-1 replication steps, and was not visible following infection of in vitro-activated CD4 T cells from elite controllers.

Of a total 115 patients, 42 individuals including 10 elite controllers were followed-up for more than 1 year, and changes of T(reg) and Th17 frequencies were analysed over time. The continuous loss of Th17 cells was accompanied by a concomitant rise in the frequency of T(reg) cells, resulting in a loss of Th17/T(reg) balance during the progressive HIV infection. Meanwhile, the T(reg) levels, Th17 levels and Th17/T(reg) ratios of the elite controller group were comparable to those of the HIV-1 negative controls in the follow-up study. Additionally, we demonstrated that loss of balance between Th17 and T(reg) is associated with an earlier CD4 T cell decline during the course of HIV infection. Our results indicate that a loss of immune-balance of Th17 to T(reg) during HIV-1 disease progression and the persistence of such an immune-balance in the elite controllers may have a critical role in HIV-1 infection and further shed new light into understanding the pathogenesis of HIV-1.","2011","2011 Sep","D Li; J Chen; M Jia; K Hong; Y Ruan; H Liang; S Liu; X Zhang; H Zhao; H Peng; P Ma; Y Shao","State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."

In addition, HLA-B57 was associated with a lower HCV viral load in the control group and HIV controllers, and conversely, HLA-B35 with higher HCV viral load in HIV controllers. The subrepresentation of HCV genotype 1 and the overrepresentation of HLA-B57 only partly explained the lower HCV viral load found in HIV controllers. In fact, HIV controller status was independently associated with lower HCV viral load, together with HCV genotype non-1, the presence of HLA-B57 and absence of HLA-B35.

Here, we show that compared with HIV-1 progressors and HIV-1-negative persons, CD4+ T cells from elite controllers are less susceptible to HIV-1 infection. This partial resistance to HIV-1 infection involved less effective reverse transcription and mRNA transcription from proviral DNA and was associated with strong and selective upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (also known as cip-1 and waf-1). Experimental blockade of p21 in CD4+ T cells from elite controllers resulted in a marked increase of viral reverse transcripts and mRNA production and led to higher enzymatic activities of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), which serves as a transcriptional coactivator of HIV-1 gene expression. This suggests that p21 acts as a barrier against HIV-1 infection in CD4+ T cells from elite controllers by inhibiting a cyclin-dependent kinase required for effective HIV-1 replication.

One critical element of CD8+ T-cell effector function and differentiation is the T-box transcription factor T-bet. In the present study, we assessed T-bet expression, together with the effector proteins perforin, granzyme A (Grz A), granzyme B (Grz B), and granulysin, in HIV-specific CD8+ T cells from ECs (n = 20), chronically infected progressors (CPs; n = 18), and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-suppressed individuals (n = 19). Compared with the other cohort groups, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells among ECs demonstrated a superior ability to express perforin and Grz B, but with no detectable difference in the levels of Grz A or granulysin. We also observed higher levels of T-bet in HIV-specific CD8+ T cells from ECs, with an ensuing positive correlation between T-bet and levels of both perforin and Grz B. Moreover, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in ECs up-regulated T-bet to a greater extent than CPs after in vitro expansion, with concomitant up-regulation of perforin and Grz B. These results suggest that T-bet may play an important role in driving effector function, and its modulation may lead to enhanced effector activity against HIV.","2011","2011 Apr 07","Adam R Hersperger; Jeffrey N Martin; Lucy Y Shin; Prameet M Sheth; Colin M Kovacs; Gabriela L Cosma; George Makedonas; Florencia Pereyra; Bruce D Walker; Rupert Kaul; Steven G Deeks; Michael R Betts","Department of Microbiology, University of Pennsylvania, 3610 Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."

The identification of the molecular, structural and evolutionary footprints underlying these very distinct immunological and clinical outcomes may lead to the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of HIV infection. We performed a side-by-side molecular, evolutionary and structural comparison of the C2, V3 and C3 envelope regions from HIV-1 and HIV-2. These regions contain major antigenic targets and are important for receptor binding. In HIV-2, these regions also have immune modulatory properties. We found that these regions are significantly more variable in HIV-1 than in HIV-2. Within each virus, C3 is the most entropic region followed by either C2 (HIV-2) or V3 (HIV-1). The C3 region is well exposed in the HIV-2 envelope and is under strong diversifying selection suggesting that, like in HIV-1, it may harbour neutralizing epitopes. Notably, however, extreme diversification of C2 and C3 seems to be deleterious for HIV-2 and prevent its transmission. Computer modelling simulations showed that in HIV-2 the V3 loop is much less exposed than C2 and C3 and has a retractile conformation due to a physical interaction with both C2 and C3. The concealed and conserved nature of V3 in the HIV-2 is consistent with its lack of immunodominancy in vivo and with its role in preventing immune activation. In contrast, HIV-1 had an extended and accessible V3 loop that is consistent with its immunodominant and neutralizing nature. We identify significant structural and functional constrains to the diversification and evolution of C2, V3 and C3 in the HIV-2 envelope but not in HIV-1. These studies highlight fundamental differences in the biology and infection of HIV-1 and HIV-2 and in their mode of interaction with the human immune system and may inform new vaccine and therapeutic interventions against these viruses.","2011","2011 Jan 20","Helena Barroso; Pedro Borrego; Inês Bártolo; José Maria Marcelino; Carlos Família; Alexandre Quintas; Nuno Taveira","Unidade dos Retrovírus e Infecções Associadas, Centro de Patogénese Molecular, Faculdade de Farmácia de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal."

Plasma from 120 HIV-1-infected patients, including HIV-1 natural viral suppressors (similar to elite controllers), was tested for neutralization against 15 Tier 1/Tier 2 HIV-1 pseudoviruses. Broad HIV-1 neutralizing antibody activity was confirmed with immunoglobulin G and heterlogous clade testing (18 pseudoviruses from Clades A, C, and CRF02_AG). Statistical analysis was performed to determine factors associated with broad HIV-1 neutralizing antibody activity. Ten individuals with broad HIV-1 neutralizing antibody activity were identified. These individuals had a median CD4 count of 589 cells per microliter (range 202-927), 1611 HIV-1 RNA copies per milliliter (range 110-8964), and 13 years since HIV diagnosis (range 1-22). There was a significant correlation between the presence of broadly neutralizing antibodies in those with HIV-1 RNA between 100 and 10,000 copies per milliliter compared with those <100 or >10,000 copies per milliliter (P = 0.0003 and 0.0245, respectively).

Male sex was associated with broad HIV-1 neutralizing antibody activity (P = 0.016). These results indicate that low but persistent HIV antigen expression correlates with broad HIV-1 neutralizing antibody activity. At higher levels of plasma viremia, neutralization titers were diminished. Conversely, at lower levels, there seems to be insufficient antigen stimulation to maintain high neutralization titers.

The transcriptional profiles for the majority of elite controllers were similar to those of ART-treated patients but different from those of HIV-1-negative persons. Yet, a smaller proportion of elite controllers showed an alternative gene expression pattern that was indistinguishable from that of HIV-1-negative persons but different from that of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-treated individuals. Elite controllers with the latter gene expression signature had significantly higher CD4 T cell counts and lower levels of HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cell responses but did not significantly differ from other elite controllers in terms of HLA class I alleles, HIV-1 viral loads determined by ultrasensitive single-copy PCR assays, or chemokine receptor polymorphisms.

Understanding the necessary factors that govern the functional quality and protective potential of antiviral T cell responses would facilitate rational vaccine design and improve therapeutic strategies to combat persistent infections. Mouse models of chronic viral infection demonstrate that interleukin-21 (IL-21), produced primarily by CD4 T cells, is required for the generation and maintenance of functionally competent CD8 T cells and viral containment. We reasoned that preserved IL-21 production during HIV-1 infection would be associated with enhanced CD8 T cell function, allowing improved viral control. Here we analyzed the ability of CD4 and CD8 T cells to produce several cytokines in addition to IL-21 ex vivo following stimulation with overlapping HIV-1 peptides. Both CD4 and CD8 T cells were able to produce IL-21 in response to HIV-1 infection, with the latter cell type more closely associated with viral control. Furthermore, IL-21-producing HIV-1-specific CD4 T cells (compared to those producing other cytokines) were the best indicator of functional CD8 T cells.

This activity directly correlates with an asymptomatic clinical state. The objective of this study was to identify the phenotype of CD8(+) cell subsets having strong CNAR activity. CD8(+) cell subset frequencies and CNAR levels were measured for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected individuals and three groups of HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals: asymptomatic individuals with low-level viremia (vHIV), antiretroviral-drug-treated subjects with undetectable virus levels (TxHIV), and therapy-naïve aviremic elite controllers (EC). CD8(+) cells from the vHIV individuals exhibited the highest HIV-suppressing activity and had elevated frequencies of CD45RA(-) CD27(+) and PD-1(+) (CD279(+)) cells. Functional assessments of CD8(+) cells sorted into distinct subsets established that maximal CNAR activity was mediated by CD45RA(-) CCR7(-) CD27(+) and PD-1(+) CD8(+) cells. T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire profiles of CD8(+) cell subsets having strong CNAR activity exhibited increased perturbations in comparison to those of inactive subsets. Together, these studies suggest that CNAR is driven by HIV replication and that this antiviral activity is associated with oligoclonally expanded activated CD8(+) cells expressing PD-1 and having a transitional memory cell phenotype. The findings better describe the identity of CD8(+) cells showing CNAR and should facilitate the evaluation of this important immune response in studies of HIV pathogenesis, resistance to infection, and vaccine development.","2011","2011 Feb","M Scott Killian; Carl Johnson; Fernando Teque; Sue Fujimura; Jay A Levy","Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143-1270, USA."

The mechanisms responsible for this remarkable control are under intense study, with the hope of developing therapeutic vaccines effective against HIV-1. In this study, we addressed the question of the intrinsic susceptibility of ES CD4(+) T cells to infection. While we and others have previously shown that CD4(+) T cells from ES can be infected by HIV-1 isolates in vitro, these studies were confounded by exogenous activation and in vitro culture of CD4(+) T cells prior to infection. In order to avoid the changes in chemokine receptor expression that have been associated with such exogenous activation, we infected purified CD4(+) T cells directly after isolation from the peripheral blood of ES, viremic patients, and uninfected donors. We utilized a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing proviral construct pseudotyped with CCR5-tropic or CXCR4-tropic envelope to compare viral entry using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based, single-round virus-cell fusion assay. The frequency of productive infection was also compared by assessing GFP expression. CD4(+) T cells from ES were as susceptible as or more susceptible than cells from viremic patients and uninfected donors to HIV-1 entry and productive infection. The results of this physiological study strongly suggest that differences in HIV-1 entry and infection of CD4(+) T cells alone cannot explain the elite control of viral replication.","2011","2011 Jan","S Alireza Rabi; Karen A O'Connell; Daria Nikolaeva; Justin R Bailey; Benjamin L Jilek; Lin Shen; Kathleen R Page; Robert F Siliciano; Joel N Blankson","Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA."

We previously showed evolution in the gag gene of ES which surprisingly was mostly due to synonymous mutations rather than non-synonymous mutation in targeted CTL epitopes. This finding could be the result of structural constraints on Gag, and we therefore examined the less conserved nef gene. We found slow evolution of nef in plasma virus in some ES. This evolution is mostly due to synonymous mutations and occurs at a rate similar to that seen in the gag gene in the same patients. The results provide further evidence of ongoing viral replication in ES and suggest that the nef and gag genes in these patients respond similarly to selective pressure from the host.","2010","2010 Nov 08","Maria Salgado; Timothy P Brennan; Karen A O'Connell; Justin R Bailey; Stuart C Ray; Robert F Siliciano; Joel N Blankson","Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 733 N, Broadway, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA."

Peripheral blood of a large cohort of HIV-infected patients (n = 131) at different stages of disease, including 15 long-term nonprogressors and 21 elite controllers, was analyzed to determine the frequency and phenotype of Tregs, defined as CD4(+), CD25(high), CD127(low), FoxP3(high) cells. A significantly increased relative frequency of Tregs within the CD4(+) compartment of HIV(+) patients compared to that of healthy controls (P < 0.0001) was observed. Additionally, the relative frequency of Tregs directly correlated with HIV viral load and inversely with CD4(+) counts. However, the absolute Treg number was reduced in HIV-infected patients versus healthy controls (P < 0.0001), with the exception of elite controllers (P > 0.05). The loss of absolute Treg numbers coincided with rising markers of immune activation (P < 0.0006). The initiation of antiviral therapy significantly increased absolute Treg numbers (P < 0.0031). We find that the expression of CD39, a newly defined ectonucleotidase with immunomodulatory functions on Tregs, correlated with progressive HIV disease, HIV viral load, and immune activation. Of note, when tested in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers, the in vitro capacity to suppress T-cell proliferation was limited to CD4(+), CD25(high), CD39(+) T cells. Interestingly, Tregs of elite controllers exhibited not only the highest expression of CCR5, CTLA-4, and ICOS but also the lowest level of CD39.

Here, we evaluated the effect of the local milieu created by activated PBMC before and after HIV-1 infection on neutrophil survival and HLA-DR expression, with emphasis placed on a role for GM-CSF. PBMC of healthy adult individuals were activated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and were subsequently cultured without (HIV-1⁻) or with HIV-1 (HIV-1+). The effects of the culture supernatants or recombinant GM-CSF on survival and HLA-DR expression by neutrophils of healthy adult individuals and of HIV-1-infected individuals were evaluated using flow cytometry. Conditioned medium from PHA-activated PBMC (HIV-1⁻ and HIV-1+) increased neutrophil survival and induced HLA-DR expression by neutrophils of healthy individuals in a GM-CSF dependent fashion. HIV-1 infection variably, but consistently, increased GM-CSF production by PHA-activated PBMC but not GM-CSF production by anti-CD3/anti-CD28-activated PBMC. The latter was correlated with a loss of CD3+GMCSF+ cells after infection. Neutrophils of elite controllers exhibited a diminished HLADR response to GM-CSF in culture, whereas neutrophils of HIV-1+ subjects having a low viral load on anti-retroviral therapy or subjects with a high viral load exhibited a range of HLA-DR responses. GM-CSF production within the mucosa or draining lymph nodes may promote HIV-1 infection by facilitating sustained contact between viable neutrophils with bound HIV-1 and CD4 lymphocytes. The minimal effect of GM-CSF on HLA-DR expression by neutrophils of elite controllers provides indirect support for this conclusion.","2011","2011 Jan 01","Jun Fu; Beverly E Sha; Larry L Thomas","Department of Immunology/Microbiology, Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL 60612, USA."

To look for genetic variants that affect LTNP without necessary control of the viral load, we reanalyzed the genomewide data of the unique LTNP Genomics of Resistance to Immunodeficiency Virus (GRIV) cohort by excluding ""elite controller"" patients, who were controlling the viral load at very low levels (<100 copies/mL). The rs2234358 polymorphism in the CXCR6 gene was the strongest signal (P=2.5 x 10(-7); odds ratio, 1.85) obtained for the genomewide association study comparing the 186 GRIV LTNPs who were not elite controllers with 697 uninfected control subjects. This association was replicated in 3 additional independent European studies, reaching genomewide significance of P(combined)=9.7 x 10(-10). This association with LTNP is independent of the CCR2-CCR5 locus and the HCP5 polymorphisms. The statistical significance, the replication, and the magnitude of the association demonstrate that CXCR6 is likely involved in the molecular etiology of AIDS and, in particular, in LTNP, emphasizing the power of extreme-phenotype cohorts. CXCR6 is a chemokine receptor that is known as a minor coreceptor in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection but could participate in disease progression through its role as a mediator of inflammation.","2010","2010 Sep 15","Sophie Limou; Cédric Coulonges; Joshua T Herbeck; Daniëlle van Manen; Ping An; Sigrid Le Clerc; Olivier Delaneau; Gora Diop; Lieng Taing; Matthieu Montes; Angélique B van't Wout; Geoffrey S Gottlieb; Amu Therwath; Christine Rouzioux; Jean-François Delfraissy; Jean-Daniel Lelièvre; Yves Lévy; Serge Hercberg; Christian Dina; John Phair; Sharyne Donfield; James J Goedert; Susan Buchbinder; Jérôme Estaquier; François Schächter; Ivo Gut; Philippe Froguel; James I Mullins; Hanneke Schuitemaker; Cheryl Winkler; Jean-François Zagury","Chaire de Bioinformatique, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers."

In HIV-1 infection, myeloid dendritic cells are highly dysfunctional, but mechanisms contributing to their functional alterations are not well defined. Here, we show that soluble molecules of the nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class Ib (MHC-Ib) antigen HLA-G are highly upregulated in the plasma during progressive HIV-1 infection, while levels of membrane-bound HLA-G surface expression on dendritic cells, monocytes, and T cells only slightly differ among HIV-1 progressors, HIV-1 elite controllers, and HIV-1-negative persons. These elevated levels of soluble HLA-G in progressive HIV-1 infection likely result from increased secretion of intracellularly stored HLA-G molecules in monocytes and dendritic cells and contribute to a functional disarray of dendritic cells by inhibiting their antigen-presenting properties, while simultaneously enhancing their secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, we observed that these immunoregulatory effects of soluble HLA-G were mainly mediated by interactions with the myelomonocytic HLA class I receptor leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2 (LILRB2; ILT4), while binding of soluble HLA-G to its alternative high-affinity receptor, LILRB1 (ILT2), appeared to be less relevant for its immunomodulatory functions on dendritic cells. Overall, these results demonstrate a critical role for soluble HLA-G in modulating the functional characteristics of professional antigen-presenting cells in progressive HIV-1 infection and suggest that soluble HLA-G might represent a possible target for immunotherapeutic interventions in HIV-1-infected persons.","2010","2010 Oct","Jinghe Huang; Patrick Burke; Yue Yang; Katherine Seiss; Jill Beamon; Thai Cung; Ildiko Toth; Florencia Pereyra; Mathias Lichterfeld; Xu G Yu","Ragon Institute of MGH, Harvard, MIT, 149, 13th Street, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA."

In this study, rectal CD8(+) T-cell responses to HIV Gag, Env, and Nef were mapped at the peptide level in four subject groups: elite controllers (n = 16; viral load [VL], <75 copies/ml), viremic controllers (n = 14; VL, 75 to 2,000 copies/ml), noncontrollers (n = 14; VL, >10,000 copies/ml), and antiretroviral-drug-treated subjects (n = 8; VL, <75 copies/ml). In all subject groups, immunodominant CD8(+) T-cell responses were generally shared by blood and mucosa, although there were exceptions. In HIV controllers, responses to HLA-B27- and HLA-B57-restricted epitopes were common to both tissues, and their magnitude (in spot-forming cells [SFC] per million) was significantly greater than those of responses restricted by other alleles. Furthermore, peptides recognized by T cells in both blood and rectal mucosa, termed ""concordant,"" elicited higher median numbers of SFC than discordant responses. In magnitude as well as breadth, HIV Gag-specific responses, particularly those targeting p24 and p7, dominated in controllers. Responses in noncontrollers were more evenly distributed among epitopes in Gag, Env, and Nef. Viremic controllers showed significantly broader mucosal Gag-specific responses than other groups. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that (i) Gag-specific responses dominate in mucosal tissues of HIV controllers; (ii) there is extensive overlap between CD8(+) T cells in blood and mucosal tissues, with responses to immunodominant epitopes generally shared by both sites; and (iii) mucosal T-cell response breadth alone cannot account for immune control.","2010","2010 Oct","April L Ferre; Donna Lemongello; Peter W Hunt; Megan M Morris; Juan Carlos Garcia; Richard B Pollard; Hal F Yee; Jeffrey N Martin; Steven G Deeks; Barbara L Shacklett","Dept. of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA."

Finally, Nef-specific responses in VS increased in the MIP+TNF-IL2- CD8 T-cell subset while Gag-specific responses did not change.

This unique functional profile is associated with a distinct surface expression pattern of immunomodulatory leukocyte-immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILR) and a strong and selective upregulation of LILRB1 and LILRB3.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) elite controllers are able to control infection with HIV-1 spontaneously to undetectable levels in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, but the mechanisms leading to this phenotype are poorly understood. Although low frequencies of HIV-infected peripheral CD4(+) T cells have been reported in this group, it remains unclear to what extent these are due to viral attenuation, active immune containment, or intracellular host factors that restrict virus replication. METHODS. We assessed proviral DNA levels, autologous viral growth from and infectability of in vitro activated, CD8(+) T cell-depleted CD4(+) T cells from HIV elite controllers (mean viral load, <50 copies/mL), viremic controllers (mean viral load, <2000 copies/mL), chronic progressors, and individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. RESULTS. Although we successfully detected autologous virus production in ex vivo activated CD4(+) T cells from all chronic progressors and from most of the viremic controllers, we were able to measure robust autologous viral replication in only 2 of 14 elite controllers subjected to the same protocol. In vitro activated autologous CD4(+) T cells from elite controllers, however, supported infection with both X4 and R5 tropic HIV strains at comparable levels to those in CD4(+) T cells from HIV-uninfected subjects. Proviral DNA levels were the lowest in elite controllers, suggesting that extremely low frequencies of infected cells contribute to difficulty in isolation of virus. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that elite control is not due to inability of activated CD4(+) T cells to support HIV infection, but the relative contributions of host and viral factors that account for maintenance of low-level infection remain to be determined.","2010","2010 Jul 15","B Julg; F Pereyra; M J Buzón; A Piechocka-Trocha; M J Clark; B M Baker; J Lian; T Miura; J Martinez-Picado; M M Addo; B D Walker","Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."

However, no functional correlates using ex vivo cells have been identified with the known ability to cause the direct elimination of HIV-infected cells. We have recently discovered the ability of human CD8(+) T-cells to rapidly upregulate perforin--an essential molecule for cell-mediated cytotoxicity--following antigen-specific stimulation. Here, we examined perforin expression capability in a large cross-sectional cohort of chronically HIV-infected individuals with varying levels of viral load: elite controllers (n = 35), viremic controllers (n = 29), chronic progressors (n = 27), and viremic nonprogressors (n = 6). Using polychromatic flow cytometry and standard intracellular cytokine staining assays, we measured perforin upregulation, cytokine production, and degranulation following stimulation with overlapping peptide pools encompassing all proteins of HIV. We observed that HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cells from elite controllers consistently display an enhanced ability to express perforin directly ex vivo compared to all other groups. This ability is not restricted to protective HLA-B haplotypes, does not require proliferation or the addition of exogenous factors, is not restored by HAART, and primarily originates from effector CD8(+) T-cells with otherwise limited functional capability. Notably, we found an inverse relationship between HIV-specific perforin expression and viral load. Thus, the capability of HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cells to rapidly express perforin defines a novel correlate of control in HIV infection.","2010","2010 May 27","Adam R Hersperger; Florencia Pereyra; Martha Nason; Korey Demers; Prameet Sheth; Lucy Y Shin; Colin M Kovacs; Benigno Rodriguez; Scott F Sieg; Leia Teixeira-Johnson; Debbie Gudonis; Paul A Goepfert; Michael M Lederman; Ian Frank; George Makedonas; Rupert Kaul; Bruce D Walker; Michael R Betts","Department of Microbiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."

Rare individuals ('elite controllers') maintain very low levels of HIV RNA without therapy, thereby making disease progression and transmission unlikely. Certain HLA class I alleles are markedly enriched in elite controllers, with the highest association observed for HLA-B57 (ref. 1). Because HLA molecules present viral peptides that activate CD8(+) T cells, an immune-mediated mechanism is probably responsible for superior control of HIV. Here we describe how the peptide-binding characteristics of HLA-B57 molecules affect thymic development such that, compared to other HLA-restricted T cells, a larger fraction of the naive repertoire of B57-restricted clones recognizes a viral epitope, and these T cells are more cross-reactive to mutants of targeted epitopes. Our calculations predict that such a T-cell repertoire imposes strong immune pressure on immunodominant HIV epitopes and emergent mutants, thereby promoting efficient control of the virus. Supporting these predictions, in a large cohort of HLA-typed individuals, our experiments show that the relative ability of HLA-B alleles to control HIV correlates with their peptide-binding characteristics that affect thymic development.

We have previously demonstrated sequence discordance between proviral and plasma gag clones in ES, much of which can be attributed to selective pressure from the host (J. R. Bailey, T. M. Williams, R. F. Siliciano, and J. N. Blankson, J. Exp. Med. 203:1357-1369, 2006). However, it is not clear whether ongoing viral replication continues in ES once the control of viremia has been established or whether selective pressure impacts this evolution. The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response in ES often targets Gag and frequently is superior to that of HIV-1 progressors, partially due to the HLA class I alleles B*57/5801 and B*27, which are overrepresented in ES. We therefore examined longitudinal plasma and proviral gag sequences from HLA-B*57/5801 and -B*27 ES. Despite the highly conserved nature of gag, we observed clear evidence of evolution in the plasma virus, largely due to synonymous substitutions. In contrast, evolution was rare in proviral clones, suggesting that ongoing replication in ES does not permit the significant reseeding of the latent reservoir. Interestingly, there was little continual evolution in CTL epitopes, and we detected de novo CTL responses to autologous viral mutants. Thus, some ES control viremia despite ongoing replication and evolution.","2010","2010 Jul","Karen A O'Connell; Timothy P Brennan; Justin R Bailey; Stuart C Ray; Robert F Siliciano; Joel N Blankson","Broadway Research Bldg., Rm 880, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 733 N.

Performed mathematical and statistical analysis of the cross-sectional estimator of HIV incidence to evaluate bias and variance. Developed probability models to evaluate impact of long tails of the window period distribution on accuracy. The standard cross-sectional estimate of HIV incidence rate is estimating a time-lagged incidence where the lag time, called the shadow, depends on the mean and the coefficient of variation of window periods. Equations show how the shadow increases with the mean and the coefficient of variation. We find with an assay such as BED capture enzyme immunoassay, if only 0.5% are elite controllers who remain in the window until death, then the shadow is over 2.3 years, implying that estimates reflect HIV incidence more than 2 years in the past rather than current levels. If even 5% of AIDS cases are unrecognized and not excluded from the numbers in the window, then the shadow is more than 2.2 years. Small perturbations to the tail of the window period distribution can have large effects on the accuracy of current HIV incidence estimates. The shadow and mean window period are useful for comparing the accuracy of assays. The results help explain differences reported between cohort and cross-sectional HIV incidence estimates. Screening out elite or viremic controllers by RNA polymerase chain reaction testing, and persons with advanced HIV disease (with AIDS or on antiretrovirals) may considerably improve the accuracy of HIV incidence estimates based on BED or similar assays.","2010","2010 Aug","Ron Brookmeyer","Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. rbrookmeyer@ucla.edu"

Here, our focus is on determining, genome-wide, the contribution of variable gene expression to viral control, and to relate it to genomic DNA polymorphism. RNA was extracted from purified CD4+ T-cells from 137 HIV-1 seroconverters, 16 elite controllers, and 3 healthy blood donors. Expression levels of more than 48,000 mRNA transcripts were assessed by the Human-6 v3 Expression BeadChips (Illumina). Genome-wide SNP data was generated from genomic DNA using the HumanHap550 Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina). We observed two distinct profiles with 260 genes differentially expressed depending on HIV-1 viral load. There was significant upregulation of expression of interferon stimulated genes with increasing viral load, including genes of the intrinsic antiretroviral defense. Upon successful antiretroviral treatment, the transcriptome profile of previously viremic individuals reverted to a pattern comparable to that of elite controllers and of uninfected individuals. Genome-wide evaluation of cis-acting SNPs identified genetic variants modulating expression of 190 genes. Those were compared to the genes whose expression was found associated with viral load: expression of one interferon stimulated gene, OAS1, was found to be regulated by a SNP (rs3177979, p = 4.9E-12); however, we could not detect an independent association of the SNP with viral setpoint. Thus, this study represents an attempt to integrate genome-wide SNP signals with genome-wide expression profiles in the search for biological correlates of HIV-1 control. It underscores the paradox of the association between increasing levels of viral load and greater expression of antiviral defense pathways. It also shows that elite controllers do not have a fully distinctive mRNA expression pattern in CD4+ T cells. Overall, changes in global RNA expression reflect responses to viral replication rather than a mechanism that might explain viral control.","2010","2010 Feb 26","Margalida Rotger; Kristen K Dang; Jacques Fellay; Erin L Heinzen; Sheng Feng; Patrick Descombes; Kevin V Shianna; Dongliang Ge; Huldrych F Günthard; David B Goldstein; Amalio Telenti; ; ","Institute of Microbiology, University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland."

It is produced mainly by CD4(+) T cells, which are also the main targets of HIV-1 and are often depleted in HIV-infected individuals. Therefore, we sought to determine the dynamics of IL-21 production and its potential consequences for the survival of CD4(+) T cells and frequencies of HIV-specific CTL. For this purpose, we conducted a series of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on different groups of HIV-infected patients and show in this study that the cytokine production is compromised early in the course of the infection. The serum cytokine concentrations correlate with CD4(+) T cell counts in the infected persons. Among different groups of HIV-infected individuals, only elite controllers maintain normal production of the cytokine. Highly active antiretroviral therapy only partially restores the production of this cytokine. Interestingly, HIV infection of human CD4(+) T cells inhibits cytokine production by decreasing the expression of c-Maf in virus-infected cells, not in uninfected bystander cells. We also show that the frequencies of IL-21-producing HIV-specific, but not human CMV-specific, Ag-experienced CD4(+) T cells are decreased in HIV-infected viremic patients. Furthermore, we demonstrate in this study that recombinant human IL-21 prevents enhanced spontaneous ex vivo death of CD4(+) T cells from HIV-infected patients. Together, our results suggest that serum IL-21 concentrations may serve as a useful biomarker for monitoring HIV disease progression and the cytokine may be considered for immunotherapy in HIV-infected patients.","2010","2010 Jan 01","Alexandre Iannello; Mohamed-Rachid Boulassel; Suzanne Samarani; Olfa Debbeche; Cécile Tremblay; Emil Toma; Jean-Pierre Routy; Ali Ahmad","Laboratory of Innate Immunity, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada."

Although recent publications have emphasized the utility of PD-1 as a marker for dysfunctional T cells in chronic viral infections, its dependence on antigenic stimulation potentially renders it a sensitive indicator of low-level viral replication. To explore the antigenic threshold for the maintenance of PD-1 expression on virus-specific T cells, we compared PD-1 expression on virus-specific and memory T cell populations in controlled and uncontrolled SIV and HIV-1 infection. In both controlled live attenuated SIV infection in rhesus macaques and HIV-1 infection in elite controllers, elevated levels of PD-1 expression were observed on SIV- and HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells. However, in contrast to chronic wild-type SIV infection and uncontrolled HIV-1 infection, controlled SIV/HIV-1 infection did not result in increased expression of PD-1 on total memory T cells. PD-1 expression on SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells rapidly decreased after the emergence of CTL escape in cognate epitopes, but was maintained in the setting of low or undetectable levels of plasma viremia in live attenuated SIV-infected macaques. After inoculation of naive macaques with a single-cycle SIV, PD-1 expression on SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells initially increased, but was rapidly downregulated. These results demonstrate that PD-1 can serve as a sensitive indicator of persistent, low-level virus replication and that generalized PD-1 expression on T lymphocytes is a distinguishing characteristic of uncontrolled lentiviral infections.","2010","2010 Jan 01","Nadine C Salisch; Daniel E Kaufmann; Amany S Awad; R Keith Reeves; Daniel P Tighe; Yuan Li; Michael Piatak; Jeffrey D Lifson; David T Evans; Florencia Pereyra; Gordon J Freeman; R Paul Johnson","Division of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, New England Primate Research Center, Southborough, MA 01772, USA."

Approximately 50% of Indian rhesus macaques that express the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I allele Mamu-B*08 become elite controllers after infection with simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239. Mamu-B*08 has a binding motif that is very similar to that of HLA-B27, a human MHC class I allele associated with the elite control of HIV, suggesting that SIVmac239-infected Mamu-B*08-positive (Mamu-B*08+) animals may be a good model for the elite control of HIV. The association with MHC class I alleles implicates CD8+ T cells and/or natural killer cells in the control of viral replication. We therefore introduced point mutations into eight Mamu-B*08-restricted CD8+ T-cell epitopes to investigate the contribution of epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell responses to the development of the control of viral replication. Ten Mamu-B*08+ macaques were infected with this mutant virus, 8X-SIVmac239. We compared immune responses and viral loads of these animals to those of wild-type SIVmac239-infected Mamu-B*08+ macaques.

Two control groups of seronegative healthy individuals and untreated patients infected with HIV-1 presenting detectable viremia were also included. None of the non-progressing elite controllers displayed the high T-cell activation levels generally seen in the seropositive individuals, keeping them within the normal range. Three non-progressing elite controllers showed no significant immune system abnormalities when compared to seronegative individuals, displaying a low proportion of HIV-1-specific binding antibodies and low avidity index, similar to those observed for individuals infected recently with HIV-1. One non-progressing elite controller exhibited CD8(+) T-cell counts and beta2-M levels above normal ranges and developed a low but ""mature"" (high-avidity) HIV-1-specific antibody response. Thus, the non-progressing elite controllers are able to maintain normal T-cell activation levels, which may contribute to prevent, or greatly reduce, the damage of the immune system typically induced by the HIV-1 over time.

Here, we quantify plasma HIV-1 RNA in elite controllers and correlate this with specific immunologic parameters. Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were quantified in 90 elite controllers with use of a real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay with a sensitivity of 0.2 copies/mL. HIV-1-specific immune responses and longitudinal CD4(+) T cell counts were examined. The median plasma HIV-1 RNA level was 2 copies/mL (interquartile range, 0.2-14 copies/mL). A longitudinal analysis of 31 elite controllers demonstrated 2-5-fold fluctuations in viremia in the majority of individuals; 6 had persistent levels below 1 copy/mL. Viremia correlated directly with HIV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies and Western blot reactivity but not with CD8(+) T cell responses. Absolute CD4(+) T cell decrease was more common among individuals with detectable viremia (P = .04). Low-level viremia is present in the majority of elite controllers and is associated with higher HIV-1-specific antibody responses.

Since Brazil has particular epidemiological features, as well as adequate policies and infrastructure, the country has been an interesting site for HIV vaccine trials. Since 1995, eight trials were performed in Brazil enrolling over 2000 subjects. Peptide vaccine candidates were initially designed to elicit neutralising antibodies as an attempt to provide sterilising immunity against HIV-1. This strategy, however, has proved extremely difficult, and candidates were poorly immunogenic. Therefore, the next vaccine candidates focused mainly on the induction of cell mediated immune responses that would limit AIDS progression and transmission by suppressing viremia. Such candidates were naked DNA or viral vectors in either prophylactic or therapeutic approaches. Even though several candidates were immunogenic, protective immune responses against HIV-1 remain to be achieved. However, several studies with non-human primates and human elite controllers demonstrate that effective immune responses against HIV-1 may be elicited, supporting the belief that an HIV-1 vaccine is possible. Much has been learned, and now the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine requires resetting priorities with focus on basic research, considering the merits of neutralising antibodies and CMI, as well as the role of innate immunity on HIV-1 protection. In this new perspective, large-scale trials should be replaced by smaller preliminary efficacy studies.","2009","2009 Sep","Jonatan Ersching; Aguinaldo R Pinto","Laboratório de Imunologia Aplicada, Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, SC, 88.040-900, Brazil."

We therefore defined a detailed peptide-binding motif for Mamu-B*08 and investigated binding similarities between the macaque and human MHC class I molecules. Analysis of a panel of approximately 900 peptides revealed that despite substantial sequence differences between Mamu-B*08 and HLA-B*2705, the peptide-binding repertoires of these two MHC class I molecules share a remarkable degree of overlap. Detailed knowledge of the Mamu-B*08 peptide-binding motif enabled us to identify six additional novel Mamu-B*08-restricted SIV-specific CD8(+) T cell immune responses directed against epitopes in Gag, Vpr, and Env. All 13 Mamu-B*08-restricted epitopes contain an R at the position 2 primary anchor and 10 also possess either R or K at the N terminus. Such dibasic peptides are less prone to cellular degradation. This work highlights the relevance of the Mamu-B*08-positive SIV-infected Indian rhesus macaque as a model to examine elite control of immunodeficiency virus replication.

These patients maintain a clinically undetectable viral load without treatment and thus provide a fascinating cohort in which to study the immunological response to HIV-1. Using an autologous system, we analyzed the effects of NK cells and CD8(+) T cells on viral replication in CD4(+) T lymphoblasts. Although we had postulated that NK cells of ES would be highly effective at controlling viral replication, we found that NK cells from some, but not all, ES were capable of inhibiting replication in the presence of interleukin-2, and the inhibition was less robust than that mediated by CD8(+) T cells. Additionally, we examined whether particular alleles of the KIR receptors, specifically KIR3DS1 and KIR3DL1, or allele-ligand combinations correlated with the control of HIV-1 replication by NK cells and whether any specific KIR alleles were overrepresented in ES. Our ES cohort did not differ from the general population with respect to the frequency of individual KIR.

Responses were examined in rare patients exhibiting durable immune-mediated control over HIV, termed long-term nonprogressors (LTNP) or elite controllers, and patients with progressive HIV infection (progressors). The magnitude of the virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell response targeting HIV, CMV, and HCV was not significantly different between LTNP and progressors, even though their capacity to proliferate to HIV antigens was preserved only in LTNP. In contrast to HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses of LTNP, HLA B5701-restricted responses within CMV pp65 were rare and did not dominate the total CMV-specific response. Virus-specific CD8(+) T cells were predominantly CD27(+)45RO(+) for HIV and CD27(-)45RA(+) for CMV; however, these phenotypes were highly variable and heavily influenced by the degree of viremia. Although IL-2 induced significant expansions of CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells in LTNP and progressors by increasing both the numbers of cells entering the proliferating pool and the number of divisions, the proliferative capacity of a significant proportion of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells was not restored with exogenous IL-2. These results suggest that immunodominance by HLA B5701-restricted cells is specific to HIV infection in LTNP and is not a feature of responses to other chronic viral infections. They also suggest that poor responsiveness to IL-2 is a property of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells of progressors that is not shared with responses to other viruses over which immunologic control is maintained.","2009","2009 Mar","Prasanna Jagannathan; Christine M Osborne; Cassandra Royce; Maura M Manion; John C Tilton; Li Li; Steven Fischer; Claire W Hallahan; Julia A Metcalf; Mary McLaughlin; Matthew Pipeling; John F McDyer; Thomas J Manley; Jeffery L Meier; John D Altman; Laura Hertel; Richard T Davey; Mark Connors; Stephen A Migueles","Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1876, USA."

HLA-B57 and the closely related allele B*5801 are particularly associated with enhanced control and recognize the same Gag(240-249) TW10 epitope. The typical escape mutation (T242N) within this epitope diminishes viral replication capacity in chronically infected persons; however, little is known about TW10 epitope sequences in residual replicating viruses in B57/B*5801 EC and the extent to which mutations within this epitope may influence steady-state viremia. Here we analyzed TW10 in a total of 50 B57/B*5801-positive subjects (23 EC and 27 viremic subjects). Autologous plasma viral sequences from both EC and viremic subjects frequently harbored the typical cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-selected mutation T242N (15/23 sequences [65.2%] versus 23/27 sequences [85.1%], respectively; P = 0.18). However, other unique mutants were identified in HIV controllers, both within and flanking TW10, that were associated with an even greater reduction in viral replication capacity in vitro. In addition, strong CTL responses to many of these unique TW10 variants were detected by gamma interferon-specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay. These data suggest a dual mechanism for durable control of HIV replication, consisting of viral fitness loss resulting from CTL escape mutations together with strong CD8 T-cell immune responses to the arising variant epitopes.","2009","2009 Mar","Toshiyuki Miura; Mark A Brockman; Arne Schneidewind; Michael Lobritz; Florencia Pereyra; Almas Rathod; Brian L Block; Zabrina L Brumme; Chanson J Brumme; Brett Baker; Alissa C Rothchild; Bin Li; Alicja Trocha; Emily Cutrell; Nicole Frahm; Christian Brander; Ildiko Toth; Eric J Arts; Todd M Allen; Bruce D Walker","Ragon Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, 149 13th St., Room 5212, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA. miura523@hotmail.com"

Production of interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta, and CD107a by CD8(+) T cells in response to HIV-1 Gag stimulation was measured using flow cytometry. Our hypothesis was that ""polyfunctional"" T cells producing multiple antiviral factors would be most abundant in mucosal tissues of HIV controllers. Mucosal CD8(+) T-cell responses were significantly stronger and more complex in controllers than in antiretroviral-suppressed persons (P = .0004). The frequency of 4-function responses in rectal mucosa was higher in controllers than in noncontrollers and patients on therapy (P < .0001). Mucosal responses in controllers were frequently stronger and more complex than blood responses. These findings demonstrate that many controllers mount strong, complex HIV-specific T-cell responses in rectal mucosa. These responses may play an important role in mucosal immune surveillance, as suggested by their relative enrichment among persons who control HIV in the absence of therapy.","2009","2009 Apr 23","April L Ferre; Peter W Hunt; J William Critchfield; Delandy H Young; Megan M Morris; Juan C Garcia; Richard B Pollard; Hal F Yee; Jeffrey N Martin; Steven G Deeks; Barbara L Shacklett","Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California-Davis, CA 95616, USA."

Measured on a per-cell basis, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells of LTNPs efficiently eliminated primary autologous HIV-infected CD4+ T cells.

Defective cytotoxicity of progressor effectors could be restored after treatment with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore.

Here we investigated the relative replication capacity of viruses (VRC) obtained from EC (n = 54) compared to those from chronic progressors (CP; n = 41) by constructing chimeric viruses using patient-derived gag-protease sequences amplified from plasma HIV RNA and inserted into an NL4-3 backbone. The chimeric viruses generated from EC displayed lower VRC than did viruses from CP (P < 0.0001). HLA-B*57 was associated with lower VRC (P = 0.0002) than were other alleles in both EC and CP groups. Chimeric viruses from B*57(+) EC (n = 18) demonstrated lower VRC than did viruses from B*57(+) CP (n = 8, P = 0.0245).

In conclusion, the vast majority (98%) of elite controllers had measurable plasma HIV RNA, often at levels higher than that observed in antiretroviral-treated patients.

Most previous studies examining for such defects have involved small numbers of subjects, primarily focused on subjects expressing HLA-B57, or have examined single viral genes, and they have focused on cellular proviral DNA rather than plasma viral RNA sequences. Here, we attempted viral sequencing from 95 HIV-1 elite controllers (EC) who maintained plasma viral loads of <50 RNA copies/ml in the absence of therapy, the majority of whom did not express HLA-B57. HIV-1 gene fragments were obtained from 94% (89/95) of the EC, and plasma viral sequences were obtained from 78% (61/78), the latter indicating the presence of replicating virus in the majority of EC. Of 63 persons for whom nef was sequenced, only three cases of nef deletions were identified, and gross genetic defects were rarely observed in other HIV-1 coding genes. In a codon-by-codon comparison between EC and persons with progressive infection, correcting for HLA bias and coevolving secondary mutations, a significant difference was observed at only three codons in Gag, all three of which represented the historic population consensus amino acid at the time of infection.

However, possession of favorable alleles does not guarantee improved prognosis or viral control. In rhesus macaques, the MHC-I allele Mamu-B*17 is correlated with reduced viremia and is overrepresented in macaques that control SIVmac239, termed elite controllers (ECs). However, there is so far no mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Here we show that the chronic-phase Mamu-B*17-restricted repertoire is focused primarily against just five epitopes-VifHW8, EnvFW9, NefIW9, NefMW9, and env(ARF)cRW9-in both ECs and progressors. Interestingly, Mamu-B*17-restricted CD8-TL do not target epitopes in Gag. CD8-TL escape variation occurred in all targeted Mamu-B*17-restricted epitopes. However, recognition of escape variant peptides was commonly observed in both ECs and progressors. Wild-type sequences in the VifHW8 epitope tended to be conserved in ECs, but there was no evidence that this enhances viral control. In fact, no consistent differences were detected between ECs and progressors in any measured parameter. Our data suggest that the narrowly focused Mamu-B*17-restricted repertoire suppresses virus replication and drives viral evolution. It is, however, insufficient in the majority of individuals that express the ""protective"" Mamu-B*17 molecule.

CD8+ T cells from both controller groups preferentially target Gag over other proteins in the context of diverse HLA class I alleles, whereas responses are more broadly distributed in persons with progressive infection. Elite controllers represent a distinct group of individuals who have significantly more CD4 and CD8 T cells that secrete interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 and lower levels of HIV-neutralizing antibodies. Individual responses were quite heterogeneous, and none of the parameters evaluated was uniquely associated with the ability to control viremia. Elite controllers are a distinct group, even when compared to persons with low level viremia, but they exhibit marked genetic and immunologic heterogeneity.

CD8(+) T cells specific for epitopes restricted by these molecules may be particularly effective. Understanding how CD8(+) T cells contribute to control of viral replication should yield important insights for vaccine design. We have recently identified an Indian rhesus macaque MHC class I allele, Mamu-B*08, associated with elite control and low plasma viremia after infection with the pathogenic isolate SIVmac239. Here, we infected four Mamu-B*08-positive macaques with SIVmac239 to investigate why some of these macaques control viral replication. Three of the four macaques controlled SIVmac239 replication with plasma virus concentrations below 20,000 viral RNA copies/ml at 20 weeks postinfection; two of four macaques were elite controllers (ECs). Interestingly, two of the four macaques preserved their CD4(+) memory T lymphocytes during peak viremia, and all four recovered their CD4(+) memory T lymphocytes in the chronic phase of infection. Mamu-B*08-restricted CD8(+) T-cell responses dominated the acute phase and accounted for 23.3% to 59.6% of the total SIV-specific immune responses. Additionally, the ECs mounted strong and broad CD8(+) T-cell responses against several epitopes in Vif and Nef. Mamu-B*08-specific CD8(+) T cells accounted for the majority of mutations in the virus at 18 weeks postinfection. Interestingly, patterns of viral variation in Nef differed between the ECs and the other two macaques. Natural containment of AIDS virus replication in Mamu-B*08-positive macaques may, therefore, be related to a combination of immunodominance and viral escape from CD8(+) T-cell responses.","2008","2008 Feb","John T Loffredo; Alex T Bean; Dominic R Beal; Enrique J León; Gemma E May; Shari M Piaskowski; Jessica R Furlott; Jason Reed; Solomon K Musani; Eva G Rakasz; Thomas C Friedrich; Nancy A Wilson; David B Allison; David I Watkins","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 555 Science Dr., Madison, WI 53711, USA."

Even though strong HIV- and SIV-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses have been detected in individuals that control viral replication, major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules have not been definitively linked with slow disease progression. In a cohort of 196 SIVmac239-infected Indian rhesus macaques, a group of macaques controlled viral replication to less than 1,000 viral RNA copies/ml. These elite controllers (ECs) mounted a broad SIV-specific CD4(+) T-cell response. Here, we describe five macaque MHC-II alleles (Mamu-DRB*w606, -DRB*w2104, -DRB1*0306, -DRB1*1003, and -DPB1*06) that restricted six SIV-specific CD4(+) T-cell epitopes in ECs and report the first association between specific MHC-II alleles and elite control. Interestingly, the macaque MHC-II alleles, Mamu-DRB1*1003 and -DRB1*0306, were enriched in this EC group (P values of 0.02 and 0.05, respectively). Additionally, Mamu-B*17-positive SIV-infected rhesus macaques that also expressed these two MHC-II alleles had significantly lower viral loads than Mamu-B*17-positive animals that did not express Mamu-DRB1*1003 and -DRB1*0306 (P value of <0.0001). The study of MHC-II alleles in macaques that control viral replication could improve our understanding of the role of CD4(+) T cells in suppressing HIV/SIV replication and further our understanding of HIV vaccine design.","2008","2008 Jan","Juan P Giraldo-Vela; Richard Rudersdorf; Chungwon Chung; Ying Qi; Lyle T Wallace; Benjamin Bimber; Gretta J Borchardt; Debra L Fisk; Chrystal E Glidden; John T Loffredo; Shari M Piaskowski; Jessica R Furlott; Juan P Morales-Martinez; Nancy A Wilson; William M Rehrauer; Jeffrey D Lifson; Mary Carrington; David I Watkins","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 555 Science Dr., Madison, WI 53711, USA."

We have designed sequence-specific primers for detection of the rhesus macaque MHC class I allele Mamu-B*08 by PCR and screened a cohort of SIV-infected macaques for this allele. Analysis of 196 SIV(mac)239-infected Indian rhesus macaques revealed that Mamu-B*08 was significantly overrepresented in elite controllers; 38% of elite controllers were Mamu-B*08 positive compared to 3% of progressors (P = 0.00001). Mamu-B*08 was also associated with a 7.34-fold decrease in chronic phase viremia (P = 0.002). Mamu-B*08-positive macaques may, therefore, provide a good model to understand the correlates of MHC class I allele-associated immune protection and viral containment in human elite controllers.","2007","2007 Aug","John T Loffredo; Jess Maxwell; Ying Qi; Chrystal E Glidden; Gretta J Borchardt; Taeko Soma; Alex T Bean; Dominic R Beal; Nancy A Wilson; William M Rehrauer; Jeffrey D Lifson; Mary Carrington; David I Watkins","Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 555 Science Drive, Madison, WI 53711, USA."

The study of these rare individuals may facilitate the definition of a successful immune response to immunodeficiency viruses. Here we describe six Indian-origin rhesus macaques that have controlled replication of the pathogenic virus SIVmac239 for 1 to 5 years. To determine which lymphocyte populations were responsible for this control, we transiently depleted the animals' CD8+ cells in vivo. This treatment resulted in 100- to 10,000-fold increases in viremia. When the CD8+ cells returned, control was reestablished and the levels of small subsets of previously subdominant CD8+ T cells expanded up to 2,500-fold above pre-depletion levels. This wave of CD8+ T cells was accompanied by robust Gag-specific CD4 responses. In contrast, CD8+ NK cell frequencies changed no more than threefold. Together, our data suggest that CD8+ T cells targeting a small number of epitopes, along with broad CD4+ T-cell responses, can successfully control the replication of the AIDS virus. It is likely that subdominant CD8+ T-cell populations play a key role in maintaining this control.","2007","2007 Apr","Thomas C Friedrich; Laura E Valentine; Levi J Yant; Eva G Rakasz; Shari M Piaskowski; Jessica R Furlott; Kimberly L Weisgrau; Benjamin Burwitz; Gemma E May; Enrique J León; Taeko Soma; Gnankang Napoe; Saverio V Capuano; Nancy A Wilson; David I Watkins","Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, 1220 Capitol Court, Madison, WI 53715-1299, USA. thomasf@primate.wisc.edu"

However, all Nef(165-173)IW9- and Vif(66-73)HW8-specific clones from elite controllers effectively suppressed SIV replication.
