There are > 10,000 new hospitalizations per week in the U.S., many of whom develop post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), or ""long COVID"", with long-term health issues and compromised quality of life. Early identification of individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 is key for monitoring and supporting respiratory status and improving outcomes. Therefore, precision tools for early detection of patients at high risk of severe disease can reduce morbidity and mortality. Here we report an untargeted and longitudinal metabolomic study of plasma derived from adult patients with COVID-19. One-carbon metabolism, a pathway previously shown as critical for viral propagation and disease progression, and a potential target for COVID-19 treatment, scored strongly as differentially abundant in patients with severe COVID-19. A follow-up targeted metabolite profiling revealed that one arm of the one-carbon metabolism pathway, the methionine cycle, is a major driver of the metabolic profile associated with disease severity. The methionine cycle produces S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl group donor important for methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins, and its high abundance was reported to correlate with disease severity. Further, genomic data from the profiled patients revealed a genetic contributor to methionine metabolism and identified the C677T allele of the MTHFR gene as a pre-existing predictor of disease trajectory - patients homozygous for the MTHFR C677T have higher incidence of experiencing severe disease. Our results raise the possibility that screening for the common genetic MTHFR variant may be an actionable approach to stratify risk of COVID severity and may inform novel precision COVID-19 treatment strategies.","2025","2025 Mar 03","Boryana Petrova; Caitlin Syphurs; Andrew J Culhane; Jing Chen; Ernie Chen; Chris Cotsapas; Denise Esserman; Ruth Montgomery; Steven Kleinstein; Kinga Smolen; Kevin Mendez; ; Jessica Lasky-Su; Hanno Steen; Ofer Levy; Joann Diray-Arce; Naama Kanarek",""

The symptomatology and severity of COVID-19 are very broad, and there are still concerns about the long-term sequelae that it can have on discharged patients. The development of pulmonary fibrotic sequelae after this infection is especially worrying. Our aim was to determine if there was a metabolomic signature that could predict the development of pulmonary fibrotic sequelae. It is a multicenter prospective observation subcohort based on the COVID-FIBROTIC study. A metabolomic analysis was performed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on serum samples from patients admitted with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia collected 2 months after hospital discharge. One year after admission, clinical, functional and radiological data were collected from these same patients. Finally, 109 patients (mean age 57.68 [DS14.03], 65.13% male) were available. Fibrotic sequelae 1 year after COVID-19 disease were found in 33% of them. Based on the NMR analysis of the serum samples, it was possible to distinguish with 80.82% of sensitivity, 72.22% of specificity and 0.83 of an area under the curve (AUC) value which patients would have radiological signs of pulmonary fibrotic pattern 1 year after sample collection. According to the metabolites participating in the discriminative model and the univariate statistics, glucose, valine, and fatty acids (═CH-CH2-CH═) were suggested as potential biomarkers of the development of pulmonary fibrotic sequelae after COVID-19.

This systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42024499281) aimed to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying LC and potential treatable traits across symptom-based phenotypes. We included studies with primary data, written in English, focusing on omics analyses of human samples from LC patients with persistent symptoms of at least 3 months. Our search in PubMed and Embase, conducted on January 8, 2024, identified 642 studies, of which 29 met the inclusion criteria after full-text assessment. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tool. The synthesis of omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics, revealed common findings associated with fatigue, cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and gastrointestinal phenotypes. Key findings included mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated microRNAs associated with pulmonary dysfunction, tissue impairment, blood-brain barrier disruption, coagulopathy, vascular dysfunction, microbiome disturbances, microbial-derived metabolite production and persistent inflammation. Limitations include cross-study heterogeneity and variability in sampling methods. Our review emphasizes the complexity of LC and the need for further longitudinal omics-integrated studies to advance the development of biomarkers and targeted treatments.","2025","2025 Mar 14","Nadia Baalbaki; Elise M A Slob; Samuel W Kazer; Mahmoud I Abdel-Aziz; Harm Jan Bogaard; Korneliusz Golebski; Anke H Maitland-van der Zee","Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Amsterdam Institute for Infection and Immunity, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Haaglanden Medical Centre, The Hague, the Netherlands.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Toxicology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.; Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Immunology, Blavatnik Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Amsterdam Institute for Infection and Immunity, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.; Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences Research Institute, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Amsterdam Institute for Infection and Immunity, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Amsterdam Institute for Infection and Immunity, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."

PASC is a multisystem condition primarily characterized by respiratory symptoms, such as reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco). Although many studies have investigated the pathogenesis of acute COVID-19, the long-term molecular changes in COVID-19 convalescents with PASC remain poorly understood. We prospectively recruited 70 individuals who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 from 7 January 2020 to 29 May 2020 (i.e., COVID-19 convalescents); we performed follow-up visits at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after hospital discharge. Thirty-five healthy controls (CONs), recruited from a physical examination center before the COVID-19 pandemic, served as a comparison group. We explored the proteomic and metabolomic profiles of 174 plasma samples from the 70 COVID-19 convalescents and 35 CONs. We performed a comprehensive molecular analysis of COVID-19 convalescents to investigate host changes up to 3 years after hospital discharge. Our multi-omics analysis revealed activation of cytoskeletal organization and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, as well as suppression of gas transport and adaptive immune responses, in COVID-19 convalescents. Additionally, metabolites involved in glutathione metabolism; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism were significantly upregulated in COVID-19 convalescents. Pulmonary and molecular abnormalities persisted for 3 years in COVID-19 convalescents; impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco) was the most prominent feature. We used this multi-omics profile to develop a model involving one protein (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK)) and two metabolites (arachidonoyl-EA and 1-O-(2r-hydroxy-pentadecyl)-sn-glycerol)) for identification of COVID-19 convalescents with abnormal DLco. These data provide insights concerning molecular sequelae among COVID-19 convalescents up to 3 years after hospital discharge, clarify mechanisms driving respiratory sequelae, and support the development of a novel model to predict reduced DLco. This longitudinal multi-omics analysis may illuminate the trajectory of altered lung function in COVID-19 convalescents.","2025","2025 Mar 05","Huqin Yang; Lujia Guan; Yi Xue; Xuyan Li; Leyi Gao; Zhijin Zhang; Haifan Zhang; Haomiao Ma; Fengjiao Liu; Xuan Huang; Zhaohui Tong; Jieqiong Li","Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Medical Research Center, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Medical Research Center, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. tongzhaohuicy@sina.com.; Beijing Research Center for Respiratory Infectious Diseases, Beijing, China. tongzhaohuicy@sina.com.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. jieqiongli2010@163.com.; Medical Research Center, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. jieqiongli2010@163.com."

We report the widespread presence of abnormal metallomic profiles in the sera of patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, even after 6 months post-discharge from hospital. We measured the concentrations of Fe, Cu, Zn, Se, Cr, Mn, Ba, Ni, Pb, Ag, As, Cd, Co, and V in the sera of 25 recovered participants and 38 healthy controls in the cross-sectional study. Higher concentrations of Cu, Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Ni, Pb, Cr and V were observed in the recovered participants, whereas lower concentrations of Fe and Se were obtained in these participants. Except for Zn, Mn, and Co, all other elements showed significant differences (p < 0.05) between the two groups, with variations dependent on age and gender. Further correlation analysis between metallome and metabolome indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to disrupt metallic homeostasis and affect metabolic processes, such as lipid metabolism and cell respiration, as well as the functions of certain organs (e.g., liver, kidney, and heart), even after 6 months recovery.

Geum japonicum var. chinense (GJC) is used as a traditional Chinese medicine to effectively treat various respiratory conditions. However, the protective effects of GJC against PF remains unclear. In the present study, the anti-PF effect of GJC aqueous extract was studied using a PF mouse model induced by bleomycin (BLM). To characterize the metabolite changes related to PF and reveal therapeutic targets for GJC aqueous extract, we performed metabolomic and network analysis on mice lungs. Finally, key targets were then validated by Western blotting. GJC aqueous extract effectively alleviated the onset and progression of lung fibrosis in PF mice by inhibiting inflammatory responses and regulating oxidative stress levels. Integrating serum metabolomics and network analyses showed the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway to be the most important metabolic pathway of GJC aqueous extract against PF. Further validation of AA pathway protein levels showed a significant rise in the levels of ALOX5, PTGS2, CYP2C9, and PLA2G2A in PF lungs. GJC aqueous extract treatment regulated the above changes in metabolic programming. In conclusion, GJC is a promising botanical drug to delay the onset and progression of PF mice. The primary mechanism of action is associated with the comprehensive regulation of metabolites and protein expression related to the AA metabolic pathway.","2025","2025 Feb 10","Junyan Ran; Qian Wang; Tao Lu; Xiuqing Pang; Shanggao Liao; Xun He","State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Gui'an New District, Guiyang 561113, China.; University Engineering Research Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Diseases by Authentic Medicinal Materials in Guizhou Province, Gui'an New District, Guiyang 550025, China.; State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Gui'an New District, Guiyang 561113, China.; University Engineering Research Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Diseases by Authentic Medicinal Materials in Guizhou Province, Gui'an New District, Guiyang 550025, China.; State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Gui'an New District, Guiyang 561113, China.; University Engineering Research Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Diseases by Authentic Medicinal Materials in Guizhou Province, Gui'an New District, Guiyang 550025, China.; State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Gui'an New District, Guiyang 561113, China.; State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Gui'an New District, Guiyang 561113, China.; University Engineering Research Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Diseases by Authentic Medicinal Materials in Guizhou Province, Gui'an New District, Guiyang 550025, China.; Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM, Ministry of Education, Guiyang 550004, China.; Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China.; State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Gui'an New District, Guiyang 561113, China.; University Engineering Research Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Diseases by Authentic Medicinal Materials in Guizhou Province, Gui'an New District, Guiyang 550025, China.; Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM, Ministry of Education, Guiyang 550004, China.; Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China."

Neurology","Humans; Male; Female; Haploinsufficiency; Child; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1; Child, Preschool; Adolescent; Brain Diseases; Mutation; Infant; Neuroinflammatory Diseases","","Through the agnostic screening of patients with uncharacterised disease phenotypes for an upregulation of type I interferon (IFN) signalling, we identified a cohort of individuals heterozygous for mutations in PTPN1, encoding the protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). We aimed to describe the clinical phenotype and molecular and cellular pathology of this new disease. In this case series, we identified patients and collected clinical and neuroradiological data through collaboration with paediatric neurology and clinical genetics colleagues across Europe (Czechia, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia, and the UK) and Israel. Variants in PTPN1 were identified by exome and directed Sanger sequencing. The expression of IFN-stimulated genes was determined by quantitative (q) PCR or NanoString technology. Experiments to assess RNA and protein expression and to investigate type 1 IFN signalling were undertaken in patient fibroblasts, hTERT-immortalised BJ-5ta fibroblasts, and RPE-1 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 editing and standard cell biology techniques. Between Dec 20, 2013, and Jan 11, 2023, we identified 12 patients from 11 families who were heterozygous for mutations in PTPN1. We found ten novel or very rare variants in PTPN1 (frequency on gnomAD version 4.1.0 of <1·25 × 10:sup>-6). Six variants were predicted as STOP mutations, two involved canonical splice-site nucleotides, and two were missense substitutions. In three patients, the variant occurred de novo, whereas in nine affected individuals, the variant was inherited from an asymptomatic parent. The clinical phenotype was characterised by the subacute onset (age range 1-8 years) of loss of motor and language skills in the absence of seizures after initially normal development, leading to spastic dystonia and bulbar involvement. Neuroimaging variably demonstrated cerebral atrophy (sometimes unilateral initially) or high T2 white matter signal. Neopterin in CSF was elevated in all ten patients who were tested, and all probands demonstrated an upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes in whole blood. Although clinical stabilisation and neuroradiological improvement was seen in both treated and untreated patients, in six of eight treated patients, high-dose corticosteroids were judged clinically to result in an improvement in neurological status. Of the four asymptomatic parents tested, IFN signalling in blood was normal (three patients) or minimally elevated (one patient). Analysis of patient blood and fibroblasts showed that tested PTPN1 variants led to reduced levels of PTPN1 mRNA and PTP1B protein, and in-vitro assays demonstrated that loss of PTP1B function was associated with impaired negative regulation of type 1 IFN signalling. PTPN1 haploinsufficiency causes a type 1 IFN-driven autoinflammatory encephalopathy. Notably, some patients demonstrated stabilisation, and even recovery, of neurological function in the absence of treatment, whereas in others, the disease appeared to be responsive to immune suppression. Prospective studies are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of specific immune suppression approaches in this disease population.

Here, we explored the relationship between circulating markers of mitochondrial quality and inflammation in adults with long COVID as well as the impact of beetroot administration on those markers. We conducted secondary analyses of a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial testing beetroot juice supplementation as a remedy against long COVID. Analyses were conducted in 25 participants, 10 assigned to placebo (mean age: 40.2 ± 11.5 years, 60% women) and 15 allocated to beetroot juice (mean age: 38.3 ± 7.7 years, 53.3% women). Extracellular vesicles were purified from serum by ultracentrifugation and assayed for components of the electron transport chain and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by Western blot and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), respectively. Inflammatory markers and circulating cell-free mtDNA were quantified in serum through a multiplex immunoassay and ddPCR, respectively. Beetroot juice administration for 14 days decreased serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, with no effects on circulating markers of mitochondrial quality control. Significant negative associations were observed between vesicular markers of mitochondrial quality control and the performance on the 6 min walk test and flow-mediated dilation irrespective of group allocation. These findings suggest that an amelioration of mitochondrial quality, possibly mediated by mitochondria-derived vesicle recycling, may be among the mechanisms supporting improvements in physical performance and endothelial function during the resolution of long COVID.","2025","2025 Jan 30","Emanuele Marzetti; Hélio José Coelho-Júnior; Riccardo Calvani; Giulia Girolimetti; Riccardo Di Corato; Francesca Ciciarello; Vincenzo Galluzzo; Clara Di Mario; Barbara Tolusso; Luca Santoro; Ottavia Giampaoli; Alberta Tomassini; Walter Aureli; Matteo Tosato; Francesco Landi; Cecilia Bucci; Flora Guerra; Anna Picca","Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""Agostino Gemelli"" IRCCS, 00168 Rome, Italy.; Department of Geriatrics, Orthopedics and Rheumatology, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, 00168 Rome, Italy.; Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""Agostino Gemelli"" IRCCS, 00168 Rome, Italy.; Department of Geriatrics, Orthopedics and Rheumatology, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, 00168 Rome, Italy.; Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""Agostino Gemelli"" IRCCS, 00168 Rome, Italy.; Department of Geriatrics, Orthopedics and Rheumatology, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, 00168 Rome, Italy.; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Salento, Via Provinciale Lecce-Monteroni, 73100 Lecce, Italy.; Institute for Microelectronics and Microsystems (IMM), CNR, Via Provinciale Lecce-Monteroni, 73100 Lecce, Italy.; Center for Biomolecular Nanotechnologies, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, 73010 Arnesano, Italy.; Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""Agostino Gemelli"" IRCCS, 00168 Rome, Italy.; Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""Agostino Gemelli"" IRCCS, 00168 Rome, Italy.; Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""Agostino Gemelli"" IRCCS, 00168 Rome, Italy.; Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""Agostino Gemelli"" IRCCS, 00168 Rome, Italy.; Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""Agostino Gemelli"" IRCCS, 00168 Rome, Italy.; Department of Environmental Biology, Sapienza University of Rome, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, 00185 Rome, Italy.; NMR-Based Metabolomics Laboratory (NMLab), Sapienza University of Rome, 00185 Rome, Italy.; R&D, Aureli Mario S.S.

Uncertainty remains about long-term recovery. We aimed to review studies examining cardiac function, macro- or microvascular function, blood biomarkers and physical activity in adult patients post-COVID-19 and highlight current knowledge gaps. Using echocardiography, persistent cardiac involvement of the left ventricle was observed in a fraction of patients both hospitalized and non-hospitalized. Ventricular dysfunction was often subclinical but may partly contribute to exercise intolerance post-COVID-19. Endothelial dysfunction was seen on micro- and macrovascular levels using retinal vessel imaging methods and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, respectively. Studies reporting blood biomarkers of disease-specific impairment and endothelial dysfunction yielded upregulated inflammation, hypercoagulability, organ and endothelial damage up to several months after infection. Omics' scale lipid profiling studies provide preliminary evidence of alterations in several lipid subspecies, mostly during acute COVID-19, which might contribute to subsequent endothelial and cardiometabolic dysfunction. Yet, more robust evidence is warranted. Physical activity may be reduced up to 6 months post-COVID-19. However, studies measuring physical activity more precisely using accelerometry are sparse. Overall, there is growing evidence for long-term multiple organ dysfunction. Research combining all the above methods in the search for underlying mechanisms of post-COVID-19 symptoms is mostly missing. Moreover, studies with longer follow-ups (i.e. ⩾18 months) and well-matched control groups are lacking. The findings may aid the development of rehabilitation regimes for post-COVID-19 syndrome. This review examined cardiac function, vascular function, blood biomarkers and physical activity in patients post-COVID-19. Evidence suggests long-term dysfunction in multiple organ systems and exercise intolerance due to various factors, including endothelial damage and, in some patients, subclinical ventricular dysfunction.

Currently, there is a lack of diagnostic tools for Long COVID in clinical practice. Therefore, this study utilizes plasma proteomics and metabolomics technologies to understand the molecular profile and pathophysiological mechanisms of Long COVID, providing clinical evidence for the development of potential biomarkers. This study included three age- and gender-matched cohorts: healthy controls (n = 18), COVID-19 recovered patients (n = 17), and Long COVID patients (n = 15). The proteomics results revealed significant differences in proteins between Long COVID-19 patients and COVID-19 recovered patients, with dysregulation mainly focused on pathways such as coagulation, platelets, complement cascade reactions, GPCR cell signal transduction, and substance transport, which can participate in regulating immune responses, inflammation, and tissue vascular repair. Metabolomics results showed that Long COVID patients and COVID-19 recovered patients have similar metabolic disorders, mainly involving dysregulation in lipid metabolites and fatty acid metabolism, such as glycerophospholipids, sphingolipid metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism processes. In summary, our study results indicate significant protein dysregulation and metabolic abnormalities in the plasma of Long COVID patients, leading to coagulation dysfunction, impaired energy metabolism, and chronic immune dysregulation, which are more pronounced than in COVID-19 recovered patients.","2024","2024","Yulin Wei; Hongyan Gu; Jun Ma; Xiaojuan Mao; Bing Wang; Weiyan Wu; Shiming Yu; Jinyuan Wang; Huan Zhao; Yanbin He","Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Nantong Hospital of Shanghai University (The Sixth People's Hospital of Nantong), Nantong, Jiangsu, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Nantong Hospital of Shanghai University (The Sixth People's Hospital of Nantong), Nantong, Jiangsu, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Nantong Hospital of Shanghai University (The Sixth People's Hospital of Nantong), Nantong, Jiangsu, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Nantong Hospital of Shanghai University (The Sixth People's Hospital of Nantong), Nantong, Jiangsu, China.; Key Laboratory of Digital Technology in Medical Diagnostics of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.; Dian Diagnostics Group Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; Key Laboratory of Digital Technology in Medical Diagnostics of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.; Dian Diagnostics Group Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; Key Laboratory of Digital Technology in Medical Diagnostics of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.; Dian Diagnostics Group Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; Key Laboratory of Digital Technology in Medical Diagnostics of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.; Dian Diagnostics Group Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Nantong Hospital of Shanghai University (The Sixth People's Hospital of Nantong), Nantong, Jiangsu, China.; Key Laboratory of Digital Technology in Medical Diagnostics of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.; Dian Diagnostics Group Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."

Recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood. Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post-hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent Anelloviridae reactivation during convalescence (≥3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue. Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae. Our data provide novel immune, transcriptomic, and metabolomic biomarkers of viral reactivation that may inform novel approaches to prognosticate, prevent, or treat acute COVID-19 and PASC.","2024","2024 Nov 16","Cole Maguire;

Additionally, many people develop post-acute symptoms associated with immune and metabolic disturbances in response to viral infection, requiring longitudinal and multisystem studies to understand the complexity of COVID-19 pathophysiology. Here, we conducted a 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance metabolomics in saliva of symptomatic subjects presenting mild and moderate respiratory symptoms to investigate prospective changes in the metabolism induced after acute-phase SARS-CoV-2 infection. Saliva from 119 donors presenting non-COVID and COVID-19 respiratory symptoms were evaluated in the acute phase (T1) and the post-acute phase (T2). We found two clusters of metabolite fluctuation in the COVID-19 group. Cluster 1, metabolites such as glucose, (CH3)3 choline-related metabolites, 2-hydroxybutyrate, BCAA, and taurine increased in T2 relative to T1, and in cluster 2, acetate, creatine/creatinine, phenylalanine, histidine, and lysine decreased in T2 relative to T1. Metabolic fluctuations in the COVID-19 group were associated with overweight/obesity, vaccination status, higher viral load, and viral clearance of the respiratory tract. Our data unveil metabolic signatures associated with the transition to the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection that may reflect tissue damage, inflammatory process, and activation of tissue repair cascade. Thus, they contribute to describing alterations in host metabolism that may be associated with prolonged symptoms of COVID-19.","2024","2024 Nov 13","Luiza Tomé Mendes; Marcos C Gama-Almeida; Desirée Lopes Reis; Ana Carolina Pires E Silva; Rômulo Leão Silva Neris; Rafael Mello Galliez; Terezinha Marta Pereira Pinto Castiñeiras; On Behalf Of The Ufrj Covid-Working Group; Christian Ludwig; Ana Paula Valente; Gilson Costa Dos Santos Junior; Tatiana El-Bacha; Iranaia Assunção-Miranda","LaRIV-Laboratory of Cellular Response to Viral Infections, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Departamento de Virologia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; LeBioME-Bioactives, Mitochondrial and Placental Metabolism Core, Institute of Nutrition Josué de Castro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; LeBioME-Bioactives, Mitochondrial and Placental Metabolism Core, Institute of Nutrition Josué de Castro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; LaRIV-Laboratory of Cellular Response to Viral Infections, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Departamento de Virologia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; LaRIV-Laboratory of Cellular Response to Viral Infections, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Departamento de Virologia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; Núcleo de Enfrentamento e Estudos de Doenças Infecciosas Emergentes e Reemergentes (NEEDIER), Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-599, Brazil.; Núcleo de Enfrentamento e Estudos de Doenças Infecciosas Emergentes e Reemergentes (NEEDIER), Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-599, Brazil.; Department of Metabolism and Systems Science, School of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine and Health, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.; National Center for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance-Jiri Jonas, Institute of Medical Biochemistry, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; LabMet-Laboratory of Metabolomics, Instituto de Biologia Roberto Alcantara Gomes (IBRAG), Department of Genetics, State University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 20551-030, Brazil.; LeBioME-Bioactives, Mitochondrial and Placental Metabolism Core, Institute of Nutrition Josué de Castro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; LaRIV-Laboratory of Cellular Response to Viral Infections, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Departamento de Virologia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil."

We conducted a pilot study to understand alterations in the gut-lung axis and to explore the effects of a probiotic in post-acute COVID-19 disease. We included patients after severe COVID-19 disease (sCOV, n = 21) in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the effect of a probiotic (Pro-Vi 5, Institute Allergosan, Graz, Austria) in a six-month intervention and used patients after mild disease (mCOV, n = 10) as controls, to compare the intestinal microbiome, metabolome, and patient-reported outcomes and biomarkers along the gut-lung axis at baseline and throughout probiotic intervention. Compared to mCOV patients, sCOV patients showed lower microbial richness, which was significantly improved by probiotic intervention. A reorganization of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae taxa was observed in sCOV patients but remained unaffected by the intervention. Serum metabolome showed a dysregulation of lipoproteins in accordance with higher BMI and comorbidities in sCOV patients. HDL and LDL fractions/components were temporarily decreased in the probiotic group. Stool metabolome was altered at baseline in sCOV patients and an increase in L-DOPA after 3 months and butyrate after 6 months of intervention could be observed. Probiotics partially improved reduced quality of life and modulated altered immune responses in sCOV patients. Increased intestinal permeability at baseline remained unaffected. The study provides evidence of long-term alterations of the gut-lung axis after severe COVID-19 infection and suggests that probiotics can modulate the biomarkers of the gut-lung axis.","2024","2024 Nov 08","Angela Horvath; Hansjörg Habisch; Barbara Prietl; Verena Pfeifer; Irina Balazs; Gabor Kovacs; Vasile Foris; Nikolaus John; Daniela Kleinschek; Nicole Feldbacher; Henning Grønbæk; Holger Jon Møller; Kristina Žukauskaitė; Tobias Madl; Vanessa Stadlbauer","Center for Biomarker Research in Medicine (CBmed), Division of Translational Precision Medicine, Division of Precision Medicine Technologies, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Division for Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Otto Loewi Research Center, Medicinal Chemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; BioTechMed-Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Center for Biomarker Research in Medicine (CBmed), Division of Translational Precision Medicine, Division of Precision Medicine Technologies, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Center for Biomarker Research in Medicine (CBmed), Division of Translational Precision Medicine, Division of Precision Medicine Technologies, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Center for Biomarker Research in Medicine (CBmed), Division of Translational Precision Medicine, Division of Precision Medicine Technologies, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Division for Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Lung Vascular Research, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Center for Biomarker Research in Medicine (CBmed), Division of Translational Precision Medicine, Division of Precision Medicine Technologies, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Division for Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Departments of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Aarhus University Hospital, 8200 Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, 8000 Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, 8000 Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospital, 8200 Aarhus, Denmark.; Division for Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Institute of Biosciences, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, 01513 Vilnius, Lithuania.; Otto Loewi Research Center, Medicinal Chemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; BioTechMed-Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Center for Biomarker Research in Medicine (CBmed), Division of Translational Precision Medicine, Division of Precision Medicine Technologies, 8010 Graz, Austria.; Division for Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.; BioTechMed-Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria."

The pathophysiology of clinical manifestations still lacks knowledge. Objective: The objective of this paper was to evaluate metabolite abundance in the saliva of long COVID patients 60 days after hospital discharge. Methods: A convenience sample was composed of 30 post-discharge patients with long COVID and seven non-COVID-19 controls. All COVID-19 patients were evaluated by demographic characteristics, spirometry, 6 min walk test (6mWT), Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and body composition. Metabolomics was performed on saliva. Results: The long COVID-19 patients were 60.4 ± 14.3 years-old, and 66% male. Their lean body mass was 30.7 ± 7.3 kg and fat mass, 34.4 ± 13.7 kg. Spirometry evaluation showed forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.84 ± 0.97 L with 96.0 ± 14.0% of the predicted value, and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of 3.11 ± 0.83 L with 98.0 ± 16.0 of the predicted value. The long COVID-19 patients had reduced maximal inspiratory (90.1 ± 31.6 cmH2O) and maximal expiratory (97.3 ± 31.0 cmH2O) pressures. SGRQ showed domain symptoms of 32.3 ± 15.2, domain activities of 41.9 ± 25.6, and domain impact 13.7 ± 11.4, with a mean of 24.3 ± 14.9%. Physical capacity measured by distance covered in the 6mWT was 418.2 ± 130 m with a 73.3% (22.3-98.1) predictive value. The control group consisted of 44.1 ± 10.7-year-old men with a body mass index of 26.5 ± 1.66 Kg/m2. Metabolomics revealed 19 differentially expressed metabolites; expression was lower in 16 metabolites, and 2 metabolites were absent in the COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Calenduloside G methyl ester (p = 0.03), Gly Pro Lys (p = 0.0001), and creatine (p = 0.0001) expressions were lower in patients than controls. Conclusions: Long COVID-19 patients present less abundance of calenduloside G methyl ester, Gly Pro Lys, and creatine in saliva than healthy controls. Lower creatine abundance may be related to reduced physical capacity and fatigue.","2024","2024 Nov 07","Luiz Machado; Robson Prudente; Estefânia Franco; Mariana Gatto; Gustavo Mota; Luana Pagan; Luís Brizola; Maércio Dos Santos; Thulio Cunha; Robinson Sabino-Silva; Luiz Goulart; Mario Martins; Paula Santos; Larissa Maia; André Albuquerque; Eloara Ferreira; Bruno Baldi; Marina Okoshi; Suzana Tanni","Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University, Botucatu 18618-970, Brazil.; Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University, Botucatu 18618-970, Brazil.; Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University, Botucatu 18618-970, Brazil.; Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University, Botucatu 18618-970, Brazil.; Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University, Botucatu 18618-970, Brazil.; Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University, Botucatu 18618-970, Brazil.; Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University, Botucatu 18618-970, Brazil.; Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University, Botucatu 18618-970, Brazil.; Faculty of Medicine of the Federal, University of Uberlandia, Uberlândia 38408-100, Brazil.; Faculty of Medicine of the Federal, University of Uberlandia, Uberlândia 38408-100, Brazil.; Faculty of Medicine of the Federal, University of Uberlandia, Uberlândia 38408-100, Brazil.; Faculty of Medicine of the Federal, University of Uberlandia, Uberlândia 38408-100, Brazil.; Faculty of Medicine of the Federal, University of Uberlandia, Uberlândia 38408-100, Brazil.; Faculty of Medicine of the Federal, University of Uberlandia, Uberlândia 38408-100, Brazil.; Department of Pneumology, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05403-000, Brazil.; Department of the Federal, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 01246-903, Brazil.; Department of Pneumology, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05403-000, Brazil.; Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University, Botucatu 18618-970, Brazil.; Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University, Botucatu 18618-970, Brazil."

The potential role of age-associated dysbiosis on disease outcomes is still elusive. In the current study, we used high-resolution shotgun metagenomics and targeted metabolomics to characterize SARS-CoV-2-associated changes in the gut microbiota from young (2-month-old) and aged (22-month-old) hamsters, a valuable model of COVID-19. We show that age-related dysfunctions in the gut microbiota are linked to disease severity and long-term sequelae in older hamsters. Our data also reveal age-specific changes in the composition and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota during both the acute phase (day 7 post-infection, D7) and the recovery phase (D22) of infection. Aged hamsters exhibited the most notable shifts in gut microbiota composition and plasma metabolic profiles. Through an integrative analysis of metagenomics, metabolomics, and clinical data, we identified significant associations between bacterial taxa, metabolites and disease markers in the aged group. On D7 (high viral load and lung epithelial damage) and D22 (body weight loss and fibrosis), numerous amino acids, amino acid-related molecules, and indole derivatives were found to correlate with disease markers. In particular, a persistent decrease in phenylalanine, tryptophan, glutamic acid, and indoleacetic acid in aged animals positively correlated with poor recovery of body weight and/or lung fibrosis by D22. In younger hamsters, several bacterial taxa ( Eubacterium , Oscillospiraceae , Lawsonibacter ) and plasma metabolites (carnosine and cis-aconitic acid) were associated with mild disease outcomes. These findings support the need for age-specific microbiome-targeting strategies to more effectively manage acute viral pneumonia and long-term disease outcomes.","2024","2024 Nov 06","Patrícia Brito Rodrigues; Vinícius de Rezende Rodovalho; Valentin Sencio; Nicolas Benech; Marybeth Creskey; Fabiola Silva Angulo; Lou Delval; Cyril Robil; Philippe Gosset; Arnaud Machelart; Joel Haas; Amandine Descat; Jean François Goosens; Delphine Beury; Florence Maurier; David Hot; Isabelle Wolowczuk; Harry Sokol; Xu Zhang; Marco Aurélio Ramirez Vinolo; François Trottein",""

Red beetroot juice may have positive effects on multiple pathways involved in long COVID. The aim of this pilot study was to explore the impact of beetroot juice supplementation on physical function, gut microbiota, and systemic inflammation in adults with long COVID. A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to test the effects of 14 days of beetroot juice supplementation, rich in nitrates and betalains, on functional and biological outcomes in adults aged between 20 and 60 years with long COVID. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either daily oral supplementation with 200 mL beetroot juice (∼600 mg nitrate) or placebo (∼60 mg nitrate) for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to day 14 in a fatigue resistance test. Secondary outcomes included the distance walked on the 6-min walk test, handgrip strength, and flow-mediated dilation. Secondary endpoints also included changes from baseline in circulating inflammatory mediators and metagenomic and fecal water metabolomic profiles. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were built to evaluate the differences in biological variables associated with the interventions. Thirty-one participants were randomized in the study. Twenty-five of them (median (interquartile range) age 40 (10), 14 [56 %] women), received either beetroot juice (15) or placebo (10) and completed the study. At 14 days, fatigue resistance significantly improved from baseline (mean difference [standard error]: +21.8 [3.7] s; p < 0.001) with no significant differences between intervention groups. A significant increase from baseline in the distance walked on the 6-min walk test was observed (mean difference [standard error]: +30.0 [9.4] m; p = 0.03), which was not different between groups. Flow-mediated dilation did not differ between participants who received beetroot juice and those on placebo. PLS-DA models allowed correct classification of participants with 92.2 ± 4.4 % accuracy. Those who ingested red beetroot juice had a greater abundance of bacteria with well-known beneficial effects, including Akkermansia, Oscillospira, Prevotella, Roseburia, Ruminococcaceae, and Turicibacter, compared with placebo. Participants allocated to beetroot juice supplementation were also characterized by significantly higher levels of fecal nicotinate, trimethylamine, and markers of beetroot juice intake (e.g., 5,6-dihydroxyindole). Finally, higher levels of interferon gamma and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β were found in participants who consumed beetroot juice. Beetroot juice supplementation for two weeks did not to induce significant improvements in functional outcomes in adults with long COVID compared with placebo.

However, it remains uncertain whether the initial severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection has implications on EO2 and exercise capacity (VO2) nor has there been assessment of anerobic ATP generation in long COVID patients. iCPET was performed on 47 long COVID patients (i.e., full cohort; n = 8 with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection). In a subset of patients (i.e., metabolomic cohort; n = 26) metabolomics on venous and arterial blood samples during iCPET was performed. In the full cohort, long COVID patients exhibited reduced peak EO2 with reduced peak VO2 (90 ± 17% predicted) relative to cardiac output (118 ± 23% predicted). Peak VO2 [88% predicted (IQR 81% - 108%) vs. 70% predicted (IQR 64% - 89%); p = 0.02] and EO2 [0.59(IQR 0.53-0.62) vs. 0.53(IQR 0.50-0.48); p = 0.01) were lower in severe versus mild infection. In the metabolomic cohort, 12 metabolites were significantly consumed, and 41 metabolites were significantly released (p-values < 0.05). Quantitative metabolomics demonstrated significant increases in inosine and succinate arteriovenous gradients during exercise. Peak VO2 was significantly correlated with peak venous succinate (r = 0.68; p = 0.0008) and peak venous lactate (r = 0.49; p = 0.0004). Peak EO2 and consequently peak VO2 impact long COVID patients in a severity dependent manner. Exercise intolerance associated with long COVID is defined by impaired aerobic and anaerobic energy production. Peak venous succinate may serve as a potential biomarker in long COVID.","2024","2024 Oct","Brooks P Leitner; Phillip Joseph; Andres Figueroa Quast; Maria Alejandra Ramirez; Paul M Heerdt; Jose G Villalobos; Inderjit Singh","Yale School of Medicine New Haven Connecticut USA.; Department of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine Yale School of Medicine New Haven Connecticut USA.; Department of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine Yale School of Medicine New Haven Connecticut USA.; Department of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine Yale School of Medicine New Haven Connecticut USA.; Department of Anesthesiology Yale School of Medicine New Haven Connecticut USA.; Department of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine Yale School of Medicine New Haven Connecticut USA.; Department of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine Yale School of Medicine New Haven Connecticut USA."

In a retrospective case-control study, we developed a precision phenotyping algorithm for identifying cohorts of patients with PASC. We used longitudinal electronic health records data from over 295,000 patients from 14 hospitals and 20 community health centers in Massachusetts. The algorithm employs an attention mechanism to simultaneously exclude sequelae that prior conditions can explain and include infection-associated chronic conditions. We performed independent chart reviews to tune and validate the algorithm. The PASC phenotyping algorithm improves precision and prevalence estimation and reduces bias in identifying PASC cohorts compared to the ICD-10-CM code U09.9. The algorithm identified a cohort of over 24,000 patients with 79.9% precision. Our estimated prevalence of PASC was 22.8%, which is close to the national estimates for the region. We also provide in-depth analyses, encompassing identified lingering effects by organ, comorbidity profiles, and temporal differences in the risk of PASC. PASC precision phenotyping boasts superior precision and prevalence estimation while exhibiting less bias in identifying patients with PASC. The cohort derived from this algorithm will serve as a springboard for delving into the genetic, metabolomic, and clinical intricacies of PASC, surmounting the constraints of prior PASC cohort studies.

Emerging evidence suggests a crucial role of metabolic reprogramming in the infection's long-term consequences. This study employs a novel approach utilizing machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze metabolic alterations in COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 patients. Samples were taken from a cohort of 142 COVID-19, 48 Post-COVID-19, and 38 control patients, comprising 111 identified metabolites. Traditional analysis methods, like PCA and PLS-DA, were compared with ML techniques, particularly eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) enhanced by SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for explainability. XGBoost, combined with SHAP, outperformed traditional methods, demonstrating superior predictive performance and providing new insights into the metabolic basis of the disease's progression and aftermath. The analysis revealed metabolomic subgroups within the COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 conditions, suggesting heterogeneous metabolic responses to the infection and its long-term impacts. Key metabolic signatures in Post-COVID-19 include taurine, glutamine, alpha-Ketoglutaric acid, and LysoPC a C16:0. This study highlights the potential of integrating ML and XAI for a fine-grained description in metabolomics research, offering a more detailed understanding of metabolic anomalies in COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 conditions.","2024","2024","Juan José Oropeza-Valdez; Cristian Padron-Manrique; Aarón Vázquez-Jiménez; Xavier Soberon; Osbaldo Resendis-Antonio","Human Systems Biology Laboratory.

In recent times, one of the most common causes of cytokine storm activation has been SARS-CoV-2 infection. A cytokine storm leads to dysregulation and excessive stimulation of the immune system, producing symptoms typical of post-COVID syndrome, including chronic fatigue, shortness of breath, joint pain, trouble concentrating (known as ""brain fog""), and even direct organ damage in the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain. This work summarizes the current knowledge regarding inflammation and the cytokine storm related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, changes in lipid metabolism and microbiota composition under the influence of inflammation in COVID-19, along with the possible underlying mechanisms, are described. Finally, this text explores potential health implications related to changes in eating behaviors and nutritional status in COVID-19 patients.

Most existing methods for integrating data from multiple sources and classifying individuals into one of multiple classes or disease groups have mainly focused on linear relationships despite the complexity of these relationships. On the other hand, methods for nonlinear association and classification studies are limited in their ability to identify variables to aid in our understanding of the complexity of the disease or can be applied to only two data types. We propose Deep Integrative Discriminant Analysis (IDA), a deep learning method to learn complex nonlinear transformations of two or more views such that resulting projections have maximum association and maximum separation. Further, we propose a feature ranking approach based on ensemble learning for interpretable results. We test Deep IDA on both simulated data and two large real-world datasets, including RNA sequencing, metabolomics, and proteomics data pertaining to COVID-19 severity. We identified signatures that better discriminated COVID-19 patient groups, and related to neurological conditions, cancer, and metabolic diseases, corroborating current research findings and heightening the need to study the post sequelae effects of COVID-19 to devise effective treatments and to improve patient care.

In contrast to CNS infections by classic neurotropic viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is usually not detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with COVID-19 with neurological involvement (neuro-COVID), suggesting fundamental differences in pathogenesis. To assess differences in CNS metabolism in neuro-COVID compared to CNS infections with classic neurotropic viruses, we applied a targeted metabolomic analysis of 630 metabolites to CSF from patients with (i) COVID-19 with neurological involvement [n = 16, comprising acute (n = 13) and post-COVID-19 (n = 3)], (ii) viral meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis (n = 10) due to herpes simplex virus (n = 2), varicella zoster virus (n = 6), enterovirus (n = 1) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (n = 1), and (iii) aseptic neuroinflammation (meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis) of unknown etiology (n = 21) as additional disease controls. Standard CSF parameters indicated absent or low neuroinflammation in neuro-COVID. Indeed, CSF cell count was low in neuro-COVID (median 1 cell/µL, range 0-12) and discriminated it accurately from viral CNS infections (AUC = 0.99) and aseptic neuroinflammation (AUC = 0.98). 32 CSF metabolites passed quality assessment and were included in the analysis. Concentrations of differentially abundant (fold change ≥|1.5|, FDR ≤ 0.05) metabolites were both higher (9 and 5 metabolites) and lower (2 metabolites) in neuro-COVID than in the other two groups. Concentrations of citrulline, ceramide (d18:1/18:0), and methionine were most significantly elevated in neuro-COVID. Remarkably, triglyceride TG(20:1_32:3) was much lower (mean fold change = 0.09 and 0.11) in neuro-COVID than in all viral CNS infections and most aseptic neuroinflammation samples, identifying it as highly accurate biomarker with AUC = 1 and 0.93, respectively. Across all samples, TG(20:1_32:3) concentration correlated only moderately with CSF cell count (ρ = 0.65), protein concentration (ρ = 0.64), and Q-albumin (ρ = 0.48), suggesting that its low levels in neuro-COVID CSF are only partially explained by less pronounced neuroinflammation. The results suggest that CNS metabolite responses in neuro-COVID differ fundamentally from viral CNS infections and aseptic neuroinflammation and may be used to discover accurate diagnostic biomarkers in CSF and to gain insights into differences in pathophysiology between neuro-COVID, viral CNS infections and aseptic neuroinflammation.","2024","2024 Jul 03","Frieder Neu; Sandra Nay; Sven Schuchardt; Frank Klawonn; Thomas Skripuletz; Kurt-Wolfram Suehs; Frank Pessler","Research Group Biomarkers for Infectious Diseases, TWINCORE Centre for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, Feodor-Lynen-Str. 7, 30625, Hannover, Germany.; Study Programme Medicine, Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia.; Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.; Fraunhofer Institute for Toxicology and Experimental Medicine (ITEM), Hannover, Germany.; Biostatistics, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Brunswick, Germany.; Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.; Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.; Research Group Biomarkers for Infectious Diseases, TWINCORE Centre for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, Feodor-Lynen-Str. 7, 30625, Hannover, Germany. frank.pessler@helmholtz-hzi.de.; Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine, Hannover, Germany. frank.pessler@helmholtz-hzi.de.; Research Group Biomarkers for Infectious Diseases, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Brunswick, Germany. frank.pessler@helmholtz-hzi.de."

PCC carries a substantial global burden associated with negative economic and health impacts. This study aims to evaluate the association between plasma taurine levels with self-reported symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with PCC. We analyzed the plasma proteome and metabolome of 117 individuals during their acute COVID-19 hospitalization and at the convalescence phase six-month post infection. Findings were compared with 28 age and sex-matched healthy controls. Plasma taurine levels were negatively associated with PCC symptoms and correlated with markers of inflammation, tryptophan metabolism, and gut dysbiosis. Stratifying patients based on the trajectories of plasma taurine levels during six-month follow-up revealed a significant association with adverse clinical events. Increase in taurine levels during the transition to convalescence were associated with a reduction in adverse events independent of comorbidities and acute COVID-19 severity. In a multivariate analysis, increased plasma taurine level between acute and convalescence phase was associated with marked protection from adverse clinical events with a hazard ratio of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.05-0.35; p<0.001).

We recently showed a metabolic shift to amino acid production and urea cycle activation in coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19), consistent with the aestivation response. The aim of the present investigation was to validate the metabolic shift and development of long-term physical outcomes in the non-COVID cohort of the Biobanque Québécoise de la COVID-19 (BQC19). We included 824 patients from BQC19, where 571 patients had data of dehydration in the form of estimated osmolality (eOSM = 2Na + 2K + glucose + urea), and 284 patients had metabolome data and long-term follow-up. We correlated the degree of dehydration to mortality, invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury, and long-term symptoms. As found in the COVID cohort, higher eOSM correlated with a higher proportion of urea and glucose of total eOSM, and an enrichment of amino acids compared with other metabolites. Sex-stratified analysis indicated that women may show a weaker aestivation response. More severe dehydration was associated with mortality, invasive mechanical ventilation, and acute kidney injury during the acute illness. Importantly, more severe dehydration was associated with physical long-term symptoms but not mental long-term symptoms after adjustment for age, sex, and disease severity. Patients with water deficit in the form of increased eOSM tend to have more severe disease and experience more physical symptoms after an acute episode of care. This is associated with amino acid and urea production, indicating dehydration-induced muscle wasting.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We have previously shown that humans exhibit an aestivation-like response where dehydration leads to a metabolic shift to urea synthesis, which is associated with long-term weakness indicating muscle wasting. In the present study, we validate this response in a new cohort and present a deeper metabolomic analysis and pathway analysis. Finally, we present a sex-stratified analysis suggesting weaker aestivation in women. However, women show less dehydration, so the association warrants further study.","2024","2024 Jul 01","Annelie Barrueta Tenhunen; Guillaume Butler-Laporte; Satoshi Yoshiji; Dave R Morrison; Tomoko Nakanishi; Yiheng Chen; Vincenzo Forgetta; Yossi Farjoun; Adriana Marton; Jens Marc Titze; Sandra Nihlén; Robert Frithiof; Miklos Lipcsey; J Brent Richards; Michael Hultström","Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Lady Davis Institute of Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Lady Davis Institute of Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Kyoto-McGill International Collaborative Program in Genomic Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.; Research Fellow, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, Japan.; Hedenstierna Laboratory, Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Lady Davis Institute of Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Kyoto-McGill International Collaborative Program in Genomic Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.; Research Fellow, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, Japan.; Lady Davis Institute of Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Lady Davis Institute of Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; 5 Prime Sciences, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Lady Davis Institute of Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; 5 Prime Sciences, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States.; Fulcrum Genomics, Boulder, Colorado, United States.; Program in Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.; Program in Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.; Division of Nephrology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, United States.; Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Hedenstierna Laboratory, Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Lady Davis Institute of Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Department of Twin Research, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; 5 Prime Sciences, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Lady Davis Institute of Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Integrative Physiology, Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."

In a retrospective case-control study, we developed a precision phenotyping algorithm for identifying research cohorts of PASC patients, defined as a diagnosis of exclusion. We used longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data from over 295 thousand patients from 14 hospitals and 20 community health centers in Massachusetts. The algorithm employs an attention mechanism to exclude sequelae that prior conditions can explain. We performed independent chart reviews to tune and validate our precision phenotyping algorithm. Our PASC phenotyping algorithm improves precision and prevalence estimation and reduces bias in identifying Long COVID patients compared to the U09.9 diagnosis code. Our algorithm identified a PASC research cohort of over 24 thousand patients (compared to about 6 thousand when using the U09.9 diagnosis code), with a 79.9 percent precision (compared to 77.8 percent from the U09.9 diagnosis code). Our estimated prevalence of PASC was 22.8 percent, which is close to the national estimates for the region. We also provide an in-depth analysis outlining the clinical attributes, encompassing identified lingering effects by organ, comorbidity profiles, and temporal differences in the risk of PASC. The PASC phenotyping method presented in this study boasts superior precision, accurately gauges the prevalence of PASC without underestimating it, and exhibits less bias in pinpointing Long COVID patients. The PASC cohort derived from our algorithm will serve as a springboard for delving into Long COVID's genetic, metabolomic, and clinical intricacies, surmounting the constraints of recent PASC cohort studies, which were hampered by their limited size and available outcome data.","2024","2024 Apr 16","Alaleh Azhir; Jonas Hügel; Jiazi Tian; Jingya Cheng; Ingrid V Bassett; Douglas S Bell; Elmer V Bernstam; Maha R Farhat; Darren W Henderson; Emily S Lau; Michele Morris; Yevgeniy R Semenov; Virginia A Triant; Shyam Visweswaran; Zachary H Strasser; Jeffrey G Klann; Shawn N Murphy; Hossein Estiri",""

Here, a multiplatform mass spectrometry-based approach was used for metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of human plasma samples from Long COVID patients (n = 40) to reveal mitochondrial dysfunction when compared with individuals fully recovered from acute mild COVID-19 (n = 40). Untargeted metabolomic analysis using CE-ESI(+/-)-TOF-MS and GC-Q-MS was performed. Additionally, a lipidomic analysis using LC-ESI(+/-)-QTOF-MS based on an in-house library revealed 447 lipid species identified with a high confidence annotation level. The integration of complementary analytical platforms has allowed a comprehensive metabolic and lipidomic characterization of plasma alterations in Long COVID disease that found 46 relevant metabolites which allowed to discriminate between Long COVID and fully recovered patients. We report specific metabolites altered in Long COVID, mainly related to a decrease in the amino acid metabolism and ceramide plasma levels and an increase in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, reinforcing the evidence of an impaired mitochondrial function. The most relevant alterations shown in this study will help to better understand the insights of Long COVID syndrome by providing a deeper knowledge of the metabolomic basis of the pathology.","2024","2024 Aug 02","Sara Martínez; Oihane E Albóniga; María Rosa López-Huertas; Ana Gradillas; Coral Barbas","Centro de Metabolómica y Bioanálisis (CEMBIO), Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities.

While most studies focus on the acute phase of COVID-19, there's a significant lack of information on the lipidomic changes that occur in the later stages of the disease. Addressing this knowledge gap is critical for understanding the long-term effects of COVID-19 and could be key to developing personalized treatments for those suffering from PCC. We employed untargeted lipidomics to analyze plasma samples from 147 PCC patients, assessing nearly 400 polar lipids. Data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML) tools were utilized to decode the results and ascertain significant lipidomic patterns. The study uncovered substantial changes in various lipid subclasses, presenting a detailed profile of the polar lipid fraction in PCC patients. These alterations correlated with ongoing inflammation and immune response. Notably, there were elevated levels of lysophosphatidylglycerols (LPGs) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), and reduced levels of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), suggesting these as potential lipid biomarkers for PCC. The lipidomic signatures indicated specific anionic lipid changes, implicating antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in inflammation. Associations between particular medications and symptoms were also suggested. Classification models, such as multinomial regression (MR) and random forest (RF), successfully differentiated between symptomatic and asymptomatic PCC groups using lipidomic profiles. The study's groundbreaking discovery of specific lipidomic disruptions in PCC patients marks a significant stride in the quest to comprehend and combat this condition. The identified lipid biomarkers not only pave the way for novel diagnostic tools but also hold the promise to tailor individualized therapeutic strategies, potentially revolutionizing the clinical approach to managing PCC and improving patient care.","2024","2024 Apr","P F Garrido; L S Castillo-Peinado; F Priego-Capote; I Barrio; Á Piñeiro; M J Domínguez-Santalla; E Rodríguez-Ruiz; R Garcia-Fandino","Institute of Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI), Joint Units IQFR-CSIC-BIFI, and GBsC-CSIC-BIFI, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza 50018, Spain.; Department of Analytical Chemistry, University of Córdoba, Annex C-3 Building, Campus of Rabanales, Córdoba 14071, Spain; Maimónides Institute for Biomedical Research (IMIBIC), Reina Sofía University Hospital, University of Córdoba, Córdoba, Spain.; Department of Analytical Chemistry, University of Córdoba, Annex C-3 Building, Campus of Rabanales, Córdoba 14071, Spain; Maimónides Institute for Biomedical Research (IMIBIC), Reina Sofía University Hospital, University of Córdoba, Córdoba, Spain.; Department of Mathematics, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Leioa 48940, Spain; Basque Center for Applied Mathematics, BCAM, Bilbao 48009, Spain.; Soft Matter & Molecular Biophysics Group, Department of Applied Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain.; Internal Medicine Department, University Clinic Hospital of Santiago de Compostela (CHUS), Galician Public Health System (SERGAS), Santiago de Compostela, Spain.; Intensive Care Medicine Department, University Clinic Hospital of Santiago de Compostela (CHUS), Galician Public Health System (SERGAS), Santiago de Compostela, Spain; Simulation, Life Support & Intensive Care Research Unit of Santiago de Compostela (SICRUS), Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), Santiago de Compostela, Spain; CLINURSID Research Group, University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.

A portion of LC patients have symptoms similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), which results in a substantial reduction in their quality of life. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of LC, in particular, ME/CFS is urgently needed. We identified and studied metabolites and soluble biomarkers in plasma from LC individuals mainly exhibiting ME/CFS compared to age-sex-matched recovered individuals (R) without LC, acute COVID-19 patients (A), and to SARS-CoV-2 unexposed healthy individuals (HC). Through these analyses, we identified alterations in several metabolomic pathways in LC vs other groups. Plasma metabolomics analysis showed that LC differed from the R and HC groups. Of note, the R group also exhibited a different metabolomic profile than HC. Moreover, we observed a significant elevation in the plasma pro-inflammatory biomarkers (e.g. IL-1α, IL-6, TNF-α, Flt-1, and sCD14) but the reduction in ATP in LC patients. Our results demonstrate that LC patients exhibit persistent metabolomic abnormalities 12 months after the acute COVID-19 disease. Of note, such metabolomic alterations can be observed in the R group 12 months after the acute disease. Hence, the metabolomic recovery period for infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2 might be long-lasting. In particular, we found a significant reduction in sarcosine and serine concentrations in LC patients, which was inversely correlated with depression, anxiety, and cognitive dysfunction scores. Our study findings provide a comprehensive metabolomic knowledge base and other soluble biomarkers for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of LC and suggests sarcosine and serine supplementations might have potential therapeutic implications in LC patients. Finally, our study reveals that LC disproportionally affects females more than males, as evidenced by nearly 70% of our LC patients being female.","2024","2024","Suguru Saito; Shima Shahbaz; Xian Luo; Mohammed Osman; Desiree Redmond; Jan Willem Cohen Tervaert; Liang Li; Shokrollah Elahi","School of Dentistry, Division of Foundational Sciences, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; School of Dentistry, Division of Foundational Sciences, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; The Metabolomics Innovation Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; The Metabolomics Innovation Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; Department of Chemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; School of Dentistry, Division of Foundational Sciences, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."

Different underlying pathomechanisms appear to be involved, in particular inflammation, alterations in amino acid metabolism, autonomic dysfunction and gut dysbiosis. As routine tests are often inconspicuous in patients with Long COVID (LC), similarly to patients suffering from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), accessible biomarkers indicating dysregulation of specific pathways are urgently needed to identify underlying pathomechanisms and enable personalized medicine treatment. Within this pilot study we aimed to proof traceability of altered metabolism by urine analysis. Urine metabolome analyses were performed to investigate the metabolic signature of patients with LC (n = 25; 20 women, 5 men) in comparison to healthy controls (Ctrl, n = 8; 7 women, 1 man) and individuals with ME/CFS (n = 8; 2 women, 6 men). Concentrations of neurotransmitter precursors tryptophan, phenylalanine and their downstream metabolites, as well as their association with symptoms (fatigue, anxiety and depression) in the patients were examined. Phenylalanine levels were significantly lower in both the LC and ME/CFS patient groups when compared to the Ctrl group. In many LC patients, the concentrations of downstream metabolites of tryptophan and tyrosine, such as serotonin, dopamine and catecholamines, deviated from the reference ranges. Several symptoms (sleep disturbance, pain or autonomic dysfunction) were associated with certain metabolites. Patients experiencing fatigue had lower levels of kynurenine, phenylalanine and a reduced kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (Kyn/Trp). Lower concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and higher activity of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) were observed in patients with anxiety. Conclusively, our results suggest that amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis is disturbed in patients with LC and ME/CFS. The identified metabolites and their associated dysregulations could serve as potential biomarkers for elucidating underlying pathomechanisms thus enabling personalized treatment strategies for these patient populations.","2023","2023","Maja Taenzer; Judith Löffler-Ragg; Andrea Schroll; Pablo Monfort-Lanzas; Sabine Engl; Günter Weiss; Natascha Brigo; Katharina Kurz","Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Institute of Medical Biochemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Institute of Bioinformatics, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria."

We sought to determine (1) how protein levels change from acute to post-COVID-19 conditions, (2) whether females have a plasma protein signature different from that of males, and (3) which biological pathways are associated with COVID-19 when compared to restrictive lung disease. We measured protein levels in 74 patients on the day of admission and at 3 and 6 months after diagnosis. We determined protein concentrations by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using a panel of 269 heavy-labeled peptides. The predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were measured by routine pulmonary function testing. Proteins associated with six key lipid-related pathways increased from admission to 3 and 6 months; conversely, proteins related to innate immune responses and vasoconstriction-related proteins decreased. Multiple biological functions were regulated differentially between females and males.

Patients with PACS, both in the absence or presence of POTS, exhibit a wide range of persisting symptoms long after the acute infection. Some of these symptoms may stem from alterations in cardiovascular homeostasis, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to provide a broad molecular characterization of patients with PACS with (PACS + POTS) and without (PACS-POTS) POTS compared to healthy subjects, including a broad proteomic characterization with a focus on plasma cardiometabolic proteins, quantification of cytokines/chemokines and determination of plasma sphingolipid levels. Twenty-one healthy subjects without a prior COVID-19 infection (mean age 43 years, 95% females), 20 non-hospitalized patients with PACS + POTS (mean age 39 years, 95% females) and 22 non-hospitalized patients with PACS-POTS (mean age 44 years, 100% females) were studied. PACS patients were non-hospitalized and recruited ≈18 months after the acute infection. Cardiometabolic proteomic analyses revealed a dysregulation of ≈200 out of 700 analyzed proteins in both PACS groups vs. healthy subjects with the majority (> 90%) being upregulated. There was a large overlap (> 90%) with no major differences between the PACS groups. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed alterations in hemostasis/coagulation, metabolism, immune responses, and angiogenesis in PACS vs. healthy controls. Furthermore, 11 out of 33 cytokines/chemokines were significantly upregulated both in PACS + POTS and PACS-POTS vs. healthy controls and none of the cytokines were downregulated. There were no differences in between the PACS groups in the cytokine levels. Lastly, 16 and 19 out of 88 sphingolipids were significantly dysregulated in PACS + POTS and PACS-POTS, respectively, compared to controls with no differences between the groups. Collectively, these observations suggest a clear and distinct dysregulation in the proteome, cytokines/chemokines, and sphingolipid levels in PACS patients compared to healthy subjects without any clear signature associated with POTS. This enhances our understanding and might pave the way for future experimental and clinical investigations to elucidate and/or target resolution of inflammation and micro-clots and restore the hemostasis and immunity in PACS.","2023","2023 Nov 19","Ali Mahdi; Allan Zhao; Emelie Fredengren; Artur Fedorowski; Frieder Braunschweig; Malin Nygren-Bonnier; Michael Runold; Judith Bruchfeld; Jannike Nickander; Qiaolin Deng; Antonio Checa; Liyew Desta; John Pernow; Marcus Ståhlberg","Department of Medicine; Solna, Karolinska Institute, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden. ali.mahdi@ki.se.; Department of Cardiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. ali.mahdi@ki.se.; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine; Solna, Karolinska Institute, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine; Solna, Karolinska Institute, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Cardiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine; Solna, Karolinska Institute, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Cardiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Physiotherapy, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Women's Health and Allied Health Professionals Theme, Medical Unit Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine; Solna, Karolinska Institute, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Clinical Physiology, Karolinska University Hospital, and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Unit of Integrative Metabolomics, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine; Solna, Karolinska Institute, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Cardiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine; Solna, Karolinska Institute, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Cardiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine; Solna, Karolinska Institute, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Cardiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."

The pathophysiology is unknown, and no effective treatments have been found to date. Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain the etiology of PASC, including viral persistence, chronic inflammation, hypercoagulability, and autonomic dysfunction. Here, we propose a mechanism that links all four hypotheses in a single pathway and provides actionable insights for therapeutic interventions. We find that PASC are associated with serotonin reduction. Viral infection and type I interferon-driven inflammation reduce serotonin through three mechanisms: diminished intestinal absorption of the serotonin precursor tryptophan; platelet hyperactivation and thrombocytopenia, which impacts serotonin storage; and enhanced MAO-mediated serotonin turnover. Peripheral serotonin reduction, in turn, impedes the activity of the vagus nerve and thereby impairs hippocampal responses and memory. These findings provide a possible explanation for neurocognitive symptoms associated with viral persistence in Long COVID, which may extend to other post-viral syndromes.","2023","2023 Oct 26","Andrea C Wong;

It is estimated that at least 30% of patients who have had COVID-19 will develop long COVID. In this study, our goal was to assess the plasma metabolome in a total of 100 samples collected from healthy controls, COVID-19 patients, and long COVID patients recruited in Mexico between 2020 and 2022. A targeted metabolomics approach using a combination of LC-MS/MS and FIA MS/MS was performed to quantify 108 metabolites. IL-17 and leptin were measured in long COVID patients by immunoenzymatic assay. The comparison of paired COVID-19/long COVID-19 samples revealed 53 metabolites that were statistically different. Compared to controls, 27 metabolites remained dysregulated even after two years. Post-COVID-19 patients displayed a heterogeneous metabolic profile. Lactic acid, lactate/pyruvate ratio, ornithine/citrulline ratio, and arginine were identified as the most relevant metabolites for distinguishing patients with more complicated long COVID evolution. Additionally, IL-17 levels were significantly increased in these patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction, redox state imbalance, impaired energy metabolism, and chronic immune dysregulation are likely to be the main hallmarks of long COVID even two years after acute COVID-19 infection.","2023","2023 Aug 01","Yamilé López-Hernández; Joel Monárrez-Espino; David Alejandro García López; Jiamin Zheng; Juan Carlos Borrego; Claudia Torres-Calzada; José Pedro Elizalde-Díaz; Rupasri Mandal; Mark Berjanskii; Eduardo Martínez-Martínez; Jesús Adrián López; David S Wishart","CONAHCyT-Metabolomics and Proteomics Laboratory, Academic Unit of Biological Sciences, Autonomous University of Zacatecas, 98000, Zacatecas, Mexico. ylopezher@conacyt.mx.; Department of Health Research, Christus Muguerza del Parque Hospital - University of Monterrey, 31125, Chihuahua, Mexico.; Academic Unit of Biological Sciences, Autonomous University of Zacatecas, 98000, Zacatecas, Mexico.; The Metabolomics Innovation Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 1C9, Canada.; Departamento de Epidemiología, Hospital General de Zona #1 ""Emilio Varela Luján"", Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Zacatecas, 98000, México.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 1C9, Canada.; Laboratory of Cell Communication & Extracellular Vesicles, Division of Basic Science, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica, 14610, Ciudad de México, Mexico.; The Metabolomics Innovation Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 1C9, Canada.; The Metabolomics Innovation Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 1C9, Canada.; Laboratory of Cell Communication & Extracellular Vesicles, Division of Basic Science, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica, 14610, Ciudad de México, Mexico.; MicroRNAs and Cancer Laboratory, Academic Unit of Biological Sciences, Autonomous University of Zacatecas, 98000, Zacatecas, Mexico.; The Metabolomics Innovation Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 1C9, Canada. dwishart@ualberta.ca.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 1C9, Canada. dwishart@ualberta.ca."

Although vaccine coverage has been achieved, it is anticipated that COVID-19 will transition into an endemic disease. It is concerning that the molecular mechanisms underlying clinical evolution from mild to severe disease, as well as the mechanisms leading to long COVID-19, are not yet fully understood. NMR and MS-based metabolomics were used to identify metabolites associated with COVID-19 pathophysiology and disease outcome. Severe COVID-19 cases (n = 35) were enrolled in two reference centers in Rio de Janeiro within 72 h of ICU admission, alongside 12 non-infected control subjects. COVID-19 patients were grouped into survivors (n = 18) and non-survivors (n = 17). Choline-related metabolites, serine, glycine, and betaine, were reduced in severe COVID-19, indicating dysregulation in methyl donors. Non-survivors had higher levels of creatine/creatinine, 4-hydroxyproline, gluconic acid, and N-acetylserine, indicating liver and kidney dysfunction. Several changes were greater in women; thus, patients' sex should be considered in pandemic surveillance to achieve better disease stratification and improve outcomes. These metabolic alterations may be useful to monitor organ (dys) function and to understand the pathophysiology of acute and possibly post-acute COVID-19 syndromes.","2023","2023 Jul 24","Marcos C Gama-Almeida; Gabriela D A Pinto; Lívia Teixeira; Eugenio D Hottz; Paula Ivens; Hygor Ribeiro; Rafael Garrett; Alexandre G Torres; Talita I A Carneiro; Bianca de O Barbalho; Christian Ludwig; Claudio J Struchiner; Iranaia Assunção-Miranda; Ana Paula C Valente; Fernando A Bozza; Patrícia T Bozza; Gilson C Dos Santos; Tatiana El-Bacha","LeBioME-Bioactives, Mitochondrial and Placental Metabolism Core, Institute of Nutrition Josué de Castro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; LeBioME-Bioactives, Mitochondrial and Placental Metabolism Core, Institute of Nutrition Josué de Castro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; Laboratory of Immunopharmacology, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21041-361, Brazil.; Laboratory of Immunothrombosis, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora 36936-900, Brazil.; LabMeta, Metabolomics Laboratory, Institute of Chemistry, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-598, Brazil.; LabMeta, Metabolomics Laboratory, Institute of Chemistry, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-598, Brazil.; Lipid Biochemistry and Lipidomics Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-598, Brazil.; LabMeta, Metabolomics Laboratory, Institute of Chemistry, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-598, Brazil.; LeBioME-Bioactives, Mitochondrial and Placental Metabolism Core, Institute of Nutrition Josué de Castro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; Lipid Biochemistry and Lipidomics Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-598, Brazil.; LeBioME-Bioactives, Mitochondrial and Placental Metabolism Core, Institute of Nutrition Josué de Castro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; LeBioME-Bioactives, Mitochondrial and Placental Metabolism Core, Institute of Nutrition Josué de Castro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2SQ, UK.; School of Applied Mathematics, Fundação Getúlio Vargas, Rio de Janeiro 22231-080, Brazil.; Institute of Social Medicine, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 20550-013, Brazil.; LaRIV, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; National Center for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance-Jiri Jonas, Institute of Medical Biochemistry, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; National Institute of Infectious Disease Evandro Chagas, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.; D'Or Institute for Research and Education, Rio de Janeiro 22281-100, Brazil.; Laboratory of Immunopharmacology, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21041-361, Brazil.; LabMet-Laboratory of Metabolomics, Instituto de Biologia Roberto Alcantara Gomes (IBRAG), Department of Genetics, State University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 20551-030, Brazil.; LeBioME-Bioactives, Mitochondrial and Placental Metabolism Core, Institute of Nutrition Josué de Castro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil.; Lipid Biochemistry and Lipidomics Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-598, Brazil."

Plasma samples from 306 unvaccinated COVID-19 patients were collected in 2020 and classified into four levels of severity ranging from mild symptoms to severe ventilated cases. These samples were investigated using a combination of quantitative Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry (MS) platforms to give broad lipoprotein, lipidomic and amino acid, tryptophan-kynurenine pathway, and biogenic amine pathway coverage. All platforms revealed highly significant differences in metabolite patterns between patients and controls (n = 89) that had been collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The total number of significant metabolites increased with severity with 344 out of the 1034 quantitative variables being common to all severity classes. Metabolic signatures showed a continuum of changes across the respiratory severity levels with the most significant and extensive changes being in the most severely affected patients. Even mildly affected respiratory patients showed multiple highly significant abnormal biochemical signatures reflecting serious metabolic deficiencies of the type observed in Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome patients. The most severe respiratory patients had a high mortality (56.1%) and we found that we could predict mortality in this patient sub-group with high accuracy in some cases up to 61 days prior to death, based on a separate metabolic model, which highlighted a different set of metabolites to those defining the basic disease. Specifically, hexosylceramides (HCER 16:0, HCER 20:0, HCER 24:1, HCER 26:0, HCER 26:1) were markedly elevated in the non-surviving patient group (Cliff's delta 0.91-0.95) and two phosphoethanolamines (PE.O 18:0/18:1, Cliff's delta = -0.98 and PE.P 16:0/18:1, Cliff's delta = -0.93) were markedly lower in the non-survivors. These results indicate that patient morbidity to mortality trajectories is determined relatively soon after infection, opening the opportunity to select more intensive therapeutic interventions to these ""high risk"" patients in the early disease stages.","2023","2023 Jul 18","Samantha Lodge; Nathan G Lawler; Nicola Gray; Reika Masuda; Philipp Nitschke; Luke Whiley; Sze-How Bong; Bu B Yeap; Girish Dwivedi; Manfred Spraul; Hartmut Schaefer; Rubén Gil-Redondo; Nieves Embade; Oscar Millet; Elaine Holmes; Julien Wist; Jeremy K Nicholson","Australian National Phenome Center, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Center for Computational and Systems Medicine, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Australian National Phenome Center, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Center for Computational and Systems Medicine, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Australian National Phenome Center, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Center for Computational and Systems Medicine, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Australian National Phenome Center, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Australian National Phenome Center, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Australian National Phenome Center, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Center for Computational and Systems Medicine, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Australian National Phenome Center, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Medical School, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Fiona Stanley Hospital, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Medical School, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Department of Cardiology, Fiona Stanley Hospital, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Bruker Biospin GmbH, 76287 Rheinstetten, Germany.; Bruker Biospin GmbH, 76287 Rheinstetten, Germany.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Parque Tecnológico de Bizkaia, Bld. 800, 48160 Derio, Spain.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Parque Tecnológico de Bizkaia, Bld. 800, 48160 Derio, Spain.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Parque Tecnológico de Bizkaia, Bld. 800, 48160 Derio, Spain.; Australian National Phenome Center, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Center for Computational and Systems Medicine, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Sir Alexander Fleming Building, South Kensington, London SW7 2AZ, UK.; Australian National Phenome Center, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Center for Computational and Systems Medicine, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Chemistry Department, Universidad del Valle, Cali 76001, Colombia.; Australian National Phenome Center, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Center for Computational and Systems Medicine, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Institute of Global Health Innovation, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Faculty Building, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2NA, UK."

The abundant expression of the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 (IDO2) in fatal/severe COVID-19, led us to determine, in an exploratory observational study, whether IDO2 is expressed and active in PASC, and may correlate with pathophysiology. Plasma or serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from well-characterized PASC patients and SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals without PASC. We assessed tryptophan and its degradation products by UPLC-MS/MS. IDO2 activity, its potential consequences, and the involvement of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in IDO2 expression were determined in PBMC from another PASC cohort by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for IDO2, IDO1, AHR, kynurenine metabolites, autophagy, and apoptosis. These PBMC were also analyzed by metabolomics and for mitochondrial functioning by respirometry. IHC was also performed on autopsy brain material from two PASC patients. IDO2 is expressed and active in PBMC from PASC patients, as well as in brain tissue, long after SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is paralleled by autophagy, and in blood cells by reduced mitochondrial functioning, reduced intracellular levels of amino acids and Krebs cycle-related compounds. IDO2 expression and activity is triggered by SARS-CoV-2-infection, but the severity of SARS-CoV-2-induced pathology appears related to the generated specific kynurenine metabolites.

Long COVID-19, or long-term sequelae after recovery from COVID-19, has aroused worldwide concern because it reduces patient quality of life after rehabilitation. We aimed to characterize the functional differential profile of the oral and gut microbiomes and serum metabolites in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms associated with long COVID-19. We prospectively collected oral, fecal, and serum samples from 983 antibiotic-naïve patients with mild COVID-19 and performed a 3-month follow-up postdischarge. Forty-five fecal and saliva samples, and 25 paired serum samples were collected from patients with gastrointestinal symptoms of long COVID-19 at follow-up and from healthy controls, respectively. Eight fecal and saliva samples were collected without gastrointestinal symptoms of long COVID-19 at follow-up. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples and 2bRAD-M sequencing of saliva samples were performed on these paired samples. Two published COVID-19 gut microbiota cohorts were analyzed for comparison. Paired serum samples were analyzed using widely targeted metabolomics. Mild COVID-19 patients without gastrointestinal symptoms of long COVID-19 showed little difference in the gut and oral microbiota during hospitalization and at follow-up from healthy controls. The baseline and 3-month samples collected from patients with gastrointestinal symptoms associated with long COVID-19 showed significant differences, and ectopic colonization of the oral cavity by gut microbes including 27 common differentially abundant genera in the Proteobacteria phylum, was observed at the 3-month timepoint. Some of these bacteria, including Neisseria, Lautropia, and Agrobacterium, were highly related to differentially expressed serum metabolites with potential toxicity, such as 4-chlorophenylacetic acid, 5-sulfoxymethylfurfural, and estradiol valerate. Our study characterized the changes in and correlations between the oral and gut microbiomes and serum metabolites in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms associated with long COVID-19. Additionally, our findings reveal that ectopically colonized bacteria from the gut to the oral cavity could exist in long COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, with a strong correlation to some potential harmful metabolites in serum.","2023","2023 Jul 19","Deyu Zhang; Siyuan Weng; Chuanchao Xia; Yuqing Ren; Zaoqu Liu; Yudi Xu; Xiaoli Yang; Ruhao Wu; Lisi Peng; Liqi Sun; Jiaqi Zhu; Xuesong Liang; Yin Jia; Huaizhou Wang; Qian Chen; Dongtian Liu; Yi Chen; Honglei Guo; Xinwei Han; Zhendong Jin; Cui Chen; Xia Yang; Zhaoshen Li; Haojie Huang","Department of Gastroenterology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.; Department of Interventional Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, Henan, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, Henan, China.; Department of Interventional Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, Henan, China.; Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, Henan, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750003, Ningxia, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, Henan, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.; Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.; Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.; Shanghai Foreign Language School Affiliated to Shanghai International Studies University, Shanghai, 200433, China.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.; Department of Interventional Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, Henan, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China. sudacc@163.com.; Department of Gastroenterology, No. 905 Hospital of The Chinese People's Liberation Army, Shanghai, 200050, China. lily-xia@163.com.; Department of Gastroenterology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China. zhs_li@126.com.; Department of Gastroenterology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China. huanghaojie@smmu.edu.cn."

Symptoms can persist beyond the period of acute infection, and patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID (PASC) often exhibit a variety of symptoms weeks or months following acute phase resolution including continued pulmonary dysfunction, fatigue, and neurocognitive abnormalities. We hypothesized that dysregulated NAD metabolism contributes to these abnormalities. RNAsequencing of lungs from transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 (K18-hACE2) challenged with SARS-CoV-2 revealed upregulation of NAD biosynthetic enzymes, including NAPRT1, NMNAT1, NAMPT, and IDO1 6 days post-infection. Our data also demonstrate increased gene expression of NAD consuming enzymes: PARP 9,10,14 and CD38. At the same time, SIRT1, a protein deacetylase (requiring NAD as a cofactor and involved in control of inflammation) is downregulated. We confirmed our findings by mining sequencing data from lungs of patients that died from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our validated findings demonstrating increased NAD turnover in SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested that modulating NAD pathways may alter disease progression and may offer therapeutic benefits. Specifically, we hypothesized that treating K18-hACE2 mice with nicotinamide riboside (NR), a potent NAD precursor, may mitigate lethality and improve recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also tested the therapeutic potential of an anti- monomeric NAMPT antibody using the same infection model. Treatment with high dose anti-NAMPT antibody resulted in significantly decreased body weight compared to control, which was mitigated by combining HD anti-NAMPT antibody with NR. We observed a significant increase in lipid metabolites, including eicosadienoic acid, oleic acid, and palmitoyl carnitine in the low dose antibody + NR group. We also observed significantly increased nicotinamide related metabolites in NR treated animals. Our data suggest that infection perturbs NAD pathways, identify novel mechanisms that may explain some pathophysiology of CoVID-19 and suggest novel strategies for both treatment and prevention.","2023","2023","Amin Izadpanah; Joseph C Mudd; Joe G N Garcia; Sudesh Srivastav; Mohamed Abdel-Mohsen; Clovis Palmer; Aaron R Goldman; Jay K Kolls; Xuebin Qin; Jay Rappaport","Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, Louisiana, LA, United States.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, LA, United States.; Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, Louisiana, LA, United States.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, LA, United States.; Department of Medicine, College of Medicine Tucson, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.; Biostatistics and Data Science, Tulane University School of Public Health, New Orleans, LA, United States.; The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, Louisiana, LA, United States.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, LA, United States.; Molecular and Cellular Oncogenesis Program, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Proteomics and Metabolomics Shared Resource, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Center for Translational Research in Infection and Inflammation, Tulane School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, LA, United States.; Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, Louisiana, LA, United States.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, LA, United States.; Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, Louisiana, LA, United States.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, LA, United States."
"56","37369825","Metabolomic and gut microbiome profiles across the spectrum of community-based COVID and non-COVID disease.","Scientific reports","Humans; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Pneumonia; Hospitalization","","Whilst most individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection have relatively mild disease, managed in the community, it was noted early in the pandemic that individuals with cardiovascular risk factors were more likely to experience severe acute disease, requiring hospitalisation. As the pandemic has progressed, increasing concern has also developed over long symptom duration in many individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including among the majority who are managed acutely in the community. Risk factors for long symptom duration, including biological variables, are still poorly defined. Here, we examine post-illness metabolomic profiles, using nuclear magnetic resonance (Nightingale Health Oyj), and gut-microbiome profiles, using shotgun metagenomic sequencing (Illumina Inc), in 2561 community-dwelling participants with SARS-CoV-2. Illness duration ranged from asymptomatic (n = 307) to Post-COVID Syndrome (n = 180), and included participants with prolonged non-COVID-19 illnesses (n = 287). We also assess a pre-established metabolomic biomarker score, previously associated with hospitalisation for both acute pneumonia and severe acute COVID-19 illness, for its association with illness duration. We found an atherogenic-dyslipidaemic metabolic profile, including biomarkers such as fatty acids and cholesterol, was associated with longer duration of illness, both in individuals with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Greater values of a pre-existing metabolomic biomarker score also associated with longer duration of illness, regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found no association between illness duration and gut microbiome profiles in convalescence. This highlights the potential role of cardiometabolic dysfunction in relation to the experience of long duration symptoms after symptoms of acute infection, both COVID-19 as well as other illnesses.","2023","2023 Jun 27","Marc F Österdahl; Ronan Whiston; Carole H Sudre; Francesco Asnicar; Nathan J Cheetham; Aitor Blanco Miguez; Vicky Bowyer; Michela Antonelli; Olivia Snell; Liane Dos Santos Canas; Christina Hu; Jonathan Wolf; Cristina Menni; Michael Malim; Deborah Hart; Tim Spector; Sarah Berry; Nicola Segata; Katie Doores; Sebastien Ourselin; Emma L Duncan; Claire J Steves","King's College London, London, UK. marc.osterdahl@kcl.ac.uk.; King's College London, London, UK.; King's College London, London, UK.; University of Trento, Trento, Italy.; King's College London, London, UK.; University of Trento, Trento, Italy.; King's College London, London, UK.; King's College London, London, UK.; King's College London, London, UK.; King's College London, London, UK.; ZOE Global Ltd, London, UK.; ZOE Global Ltd, London, UK.; King's College London, London, UK.; King's College London, London, UK.; King's College London, London, UK.; King's College London, London, UK.; King's College London, London, UK.; University of Trento, Trento, Italy.; King's College London, London, UK.; King's College London, London, UK.; King's College London, London, UK.; King's College London, London, UK."

Overall, depressive symptomatology and cognitive deficits persisted for up to 1 year after COVID-19; depression and cognitive changes were predicted by acute inflammatory markers, and changes in these markers correlated with changes in depressive symptomatology; female sex, obesity, and the presence of inflammatory markers were associated with more severe clusters of physical and mental health status in patients' self-perceived recovery; and plasma metabolic profiles of patients continued to differ from those of healthy controls 3 months after hospital discharge, which were associated with widespread alterations in neuroimaging, reflecting issues with white matter integrity.

Several studies have described the role of small as well as complex molecules such as metabolites, cytokines, chemokines and lipoproteins during infection and in recovered patients. In fact, after an acute SARS-CoV-2 viral infection almost 10-20% of patients experience persistent symptoms post 12 weeks of recovery defined as long-term COVID-19 syndrome (LTCS) or long post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). Emerging evidence revealed that a dysregulated immune system and persisting inflammation could be one of the key drivers of LTCS. However, how these biomolecules altogether govern pathophysiology is largely underexplored. Thus, a clear understanding of how these parameters within an integrated fashion could predict the disease course would help to stratify LTCS patients from acute COVID-19 or recovered patients. This could even allow to elucidation of a potential mechanistic role of these biomolecules during the disease course. This study comprised subjects with acute COVID-19 (n=7; longitudinal), LTCS (n=33), Recov (n=12), and no history of positive testing (n=73). 1H-NMR-based metabolomics with IVDr standard operating procedures verified and phenotyped all blood samples by quantifying 38 metabolites and 112 lipoprotein properties. Univariate and multivariate statistics identified NMR-based and cytokine changes. Here, we report on an integrated analysis of serum/plasma by NMR spectroscopy and flow cytometry-based cytokines/chemokines quantification in LTCS patients. We identified that in LTCS patients lactate and pyruvate were significantly different from either healthy controls (HC) or acute COVID-19 patients. Subsequently, correlation analysis in LTCS group only among cytokines and amino acids revealed that histidine and glutamine were uniquely attributed mainly with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Of note, triglycerides and several lipoproteins (apolipoproteins Apo-A1 and A2) in LTCS patients demonstrate COVID-19-like alterations compared with HC. Interestingly, LTCS and acute COVID-19 samples were distinguished mostly by their phenylalanine, 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) and glucose concentrations, illustrating an imbalanced energy metabolism. Most of the cytokines and chemokines were present at low levels in LTCS patients compared with HC except for IL-18 chemokine, which tended to be higher in LTCS patients. The identification of these persisting plasma metabolites, lipoprotein and inflammation alterations will help to better stratify LTCS patients from other diseases and could help to predict ongoing severity of LTCS patients.","2023","2023","Georgy Berezhnoy; Rosi Bissinger; Anna Liu; Claire Cannet; Hartmut Schäfer; Katharina Kienzle; Michael Bitzer; Helene Häberle; Siri Göpel; Christoph Trautwein; Yogesh Singh","Werner Siemens Imaging Center, Department of Preclinical Imaging and Radiopharmacy, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.; Division of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.; Research Institute of Women's Health, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.; Bruker BioSpin, Applied Industrial and Clinical Division, Ettlingen, Germany.; Bruker BioSpin, Applied Industrial and Clinical Division, Ettlingen, Germany.; Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.; Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.; Center for Personalized Medicine, University Hospital Tübingen, Tubingen, Germany.; Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.; Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.; Werner Siemens Imaging Center, Department of Preclinical Imaging and Radiopharmacy, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.; Research Institute of Women's Health, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.; Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.; Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Competence Center Tübingen (NCCT), University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany."

Long COVID patients experienced a state of hyper-inflammation prior to chronic headache onset and maintained persistent inflammatory activation throughout the progression of chronic headache. Metabolomic analysis also revealed augmented arginine and lipid metabolisms, skewing towards a nitric oxide-based pro-inflammation. Furthermore, metabolisms of neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and GABA were markedly dysregulated during the progression of long COVID headache.

Even with underreporting, an accumulated of almost 650 million people have been infected and 620 million recovered since the start of the pandemic; therefore, the impact of these long-term consequences in the world population could be significant. Recently, the World Health Organization recognized the post-COVID syndrome as a new entity, and guidelines are being established to manage and treat this new condition. However, there is still uncertainty about the molecular mechanisms behind the large number of symptoms reported worldwide. Aims and Methods: In this study we aimed to evaluate the clinical and lipidomic profiles (using non-targeted lipidomics) of recovered patients who had a mild and severe COVID-19 infection (acute phase, first epidemic wave); the assessment was made two years after the initial infection. Results: Fatigue (59%) and musculoskeletal (50%) symptoms as the most relevant and persistent. Functional analyses revealed that sterols, bile acids, isoprenoids, and fatty esters were the predicted metabolic pathways affected in both COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients. Principal Component Analysis showed differences between study groups. Several species of phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins were identified and expressed in higher levels in post-COVID-19 patients compared to controls. The paired analysis (comparing patients with an active infection and 2 years after recovery) show 170 dysregulated features. The relationship of such metabolic dysregulations with the clinical symptoms, point to the importance of developing diagnostic and therapeuthic markers based on cell signaling pathways.","2023","2023","Yamilé López-Hernández; Juan José Oropeza-Valdez; David Alejandro García Lopez; Juan Carlos Borrego; Michel Murgu; Jorge Valdez; Jesús Adrián López; Joel Monárrez-Espino","CONACyT-Metabolomics and Proteomics Laboratory, Academic Unit of Biological Sciences, Autonomous University of Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico.; Metabolomics and Proteomics Laboratory, Academic Unit of Biological Sciences, Autonomous University of Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico.; Doctorado en Ciencias Básicas, Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico.; Departamento de Epidemiología, Hospital General de Zona #1 ""Emilio Varela Luján"", Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Centro, Zacatecas, Mexico.; Waters Technologies of Brazil, Alameda Tocantins, Barueri, Brazil.; Waters Corporation, Mexico City, Mexico.; MicroRNAs and Cancer Laboratory, Academic Unit of Biological Sciences, Autonomous University of Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico.; Department of Health Research, Christus Muguerza del Parque Hospital Chihuahua, University of Monterrey, San Pedro Garza García, Mexico."

Clinical and sociodemographic data and glycaemic, lipid, and inflammatory screening markers were collected, and cross-sectionally analysed between the long COVID-19 outcome groups. Of the 215 participants, most were female and not elderly, and 78 were hospitalised during the acute COVID-19 phase. The main long COVID symptoms reported were fatigue, dyspnoea, and muscle weakness. Our main findings show that abnormal metabolic profiles (such as high body mass index measurement and high triglyceride, glycated haemoglobin A1c, and ferritin levels) are more prevalent in worse long COVID presentations (such as previous hospitalisation and more long-term symptoms). This prevalence may suggest a propensity for patients with long COVID to present abnormalities in the markers involved in cardiometabolic health.","2023","2023 Feb 27","Daniel Carvalho de Menezes; Patrícia Danielle Lima de Lima; Igor Costa de Lima; Juliana Hiromi Emin Uesugi; Pedro Fernando da Costa Vasconcelos; Juarez Antônio Simões Quaresma; Luiz Fábio Magno Falcão","Center for Biological Health Sciences, State University of Pará (UEPA), Belém 66087-670, Brazil.; Center for Biological Health Sciences, State University of Pará (UEPA), Belém 66087-670, Brazil.; Center for Biological Health Sciences, State University of Pará (UEPA), Belém 66087-670, Brazil.; Center for Biological Health Sciences, State University of Pará (UEPA), Belém 66087-670, Brazil.; Center for Biological Health Sciences, State University of Pará (UEPA), Belém 66087-670, Brazil.; Center for Biological Health Sciences, State University of Pará (UEPA), Belém 66087-670, Brazil.; School of Medicine, São Paulo University (USP), São Paulo 01246903, Brazil.; Tropical Medicine Center, Federal University of Pará (UFPA), Belém 66055-240, Brazil.; Center for Biological Health Sciences, State University of Pará (UEPA), Belém 66087-670, Brazil.; School of Medicine, São Paulo University (USP), São Paulo 01246903, Brazil."

This feature enables the possibility of investigating SARS-CoV-2 infection using multi-omic techniques, including metabolomic studies by chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry or by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Here we review the extensive literature on metabolomics in COVID-19, that unraveled many aspects of the disease including: a characteristic metabotipic signature associated to COVID-19, discrimination of patients according to severity, effect of drugs and vaccination treatments and the characterization of the natural history of the metabolic evolution associated to the disease, from the infection onset to full recovery or long-term and long sequelae of COVID.","2023","2023","Chiara Bruzzone; Ricardo Conde; Nieves Embade; José M Mato; Oscar Millet","Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), Bilbao, Bizkaia, Spain.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), Bilbao, Bizkaia, Spain.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), Bilbao, Bizkaia, Spain.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), Bilbao, Bizkaia, Spain.; CIBERehd, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), Bilbao, Bizkaia, Spain.; CIBERehd, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain."

Metabolites contained in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are different from those in plasma at the acute stage, while the metabolic features of plasma sEVs of COVID-19 survivors remain unknown. Here, we used a nanopore membrane-based microfluidic chip for plasma sEVs separation, termed ExoSEC, and compared the sEVs obtained by UC, REG, and ExoSEC in terms the time, cost, purity, and metabolic features. The results indicated the ExoSEC was much less costly, provided higher purity by particles/proteins ratio, and achieved 205-fold and 2-fold higher sEVs yield, than UC and REG, respectively. Moreover, more metabolites were identified and several signaling pathways were significantly enriched in ExoSEC-sEVs compared to UC-sEVs and REG-sEVs. Furthermore, we detected 306 metabolites in plasma sEVs using ExoSEC from recovered asymptomatic (RA), moderate (RM), and severe/critical COVID-19 (RS) patients without underlying diseases 3 months after discharge. Our study demonstrated that COVID-19 survivors, especially RS, experienced significant metabolic alteration and the dysregulated pathways mainly involved fatty acid biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, etc. Metabolites of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway bore a significantly negative association with red blood cell counts and hemoglobin, which might be ascribed to hypoxia or respiratory failure in RM and RS but not in RA at the acute stage. Our study confirmed that ExoSEC could provide a practical and economical alternative for high throughput sEVs metabolomic study.","2023","2023 May 01","Qi Huang; Wenjing Xiao; Peng Chen; Hui Xia; Sufei Wang;

Here targeted plasma metabolomic is performed, and the metabolite profiles among healthy controls, and asymptomatic, moderate, and severe COVID-19 patients are compared. Among the altered metabolites, arachidonic acid and linolenic acid pathway metabolites are profoundly up-regulated in COVID-19 patients. Arginine biosynthesis, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathways are significantly disturbed in asymptomatic patients. In the comparison of metabolite variances among the groups, higher levels of l-citrulline and l-glutamine are found in asymptomatic carriers and moderate or severe patients at the remission stage. Furthermore, l-citrulline and l-glutamine combination therapy is demonstrated to effectively protect mice from coronavirus infection and endotoxin-induced sepsis, and is observed to efficiently prevent the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis and central nervous system damage.

This process is patient-dependent due to the manifold possibilities induced by virus severity, its phylogenic evolution and the vaccination status of the population. We have here investigated the natural history of COVID-19 disease at the molecular level, characterizing the metabolic and immunological phenoreversion over time in large cohorts of hospitalized severe patients (n = 886) and non-hospitalized recovered patients that self-reported having passed the disease (n = 513). Non-hospitalized recovered patients do not show any metabolic fingerprint associated with the disease or immune alterations. Acute patients are characterized by the metabolic and lipidomic dysregulation that accompanies the exacerbated immunological response, resulting in a slow recovery time with a maximum probability of around 62 days. As a manifestation of the heterogeneity in the metabolic phenoreversion, age and severity become factors that modulate their normalization time which, in turn, correlates with changes in the atherogenesis-associated chemokine MCP-1. Our results are consistent with a model where the slow metabolic normalization in acute patients results in enhanced atherosclerotic risk, in line with the recent observation of an elevated number of cardiovascular episodes found in post-COVID-19 cohorts.","2022","2022 Dec 01","Rubén Gil-Redondo; Ricardo Conde; Maider Bizkarguenaga; Chiara Bruzzone; Ana Laín; Beatriz González-Valle; Milagros Iriberri; Carlos Ramos-Acosta; Eduardo Anguita; Juan Ignacio Arriaga Lariz; Pedro Pablo España Yandiola; Miguel Ángel Moran; Mario Ernesto Jiménez-Mercado; Leire Egia-Mendikute; María Luisa Seco; Hartmut Schäfer; Claire Cannet; Manfred Spraul; Asís Palazón; Nieves Embade; Shelly C Lu; Julien Wist; Jeremy K Nicholson; José M Mato; Oscar Millet","Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.; Pneumology Department, Hospital Universitario de Cruces, 48903 Barakaldo, Spain.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UCM, Hematology Department, IML, IdISSC, Hospital Clínico San Carlos, 28040 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UCM, Hematology Department, IML, IdISSC, Hospital Clínico San Carlos, 28040 Madrid, Spain.; Pneumology Department, Hospital Universitario de Basurto, 48013 Bilbao, Spain.; Pneumology Department, Hospital Universitario de Galdakao-Usansolo, 48960 Galdakao, Spain.; Bioaraba Health Research Institute, 01009 Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.; Internal Medicine Department, Infectious Diseases Section, Osakidetza Basque Health Service, Araba University Hospital, 01009 Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.; Bioaraba Health Research Institute, 01009 Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.; Emergency Department, Osakidetza Basque Health Service, Araba University Hospital, 01009 Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.; Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Lab, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.; OSARTEN Kooperatiba Elkartea, 20500 Arrasate-Mondragón, Spain.; Bruker Biospin GmbH, Silberstreifen, 76287 Rheinstetten, Germany.; Bruker Biospin GmbH, Silberstreifen, 76287 Rheinstetten, Germany.; Bruker Biospin GmbH, Silberstreifen, 76287 Rheinstetten, Germany.; Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Lab, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.; Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for Science, 48015 Derio, Spain.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.; Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Australian National Phenome Center, and Center for Computational and Systems Medicine, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Chemistry Department, Universidad del Valle, Cali 76001, Colombia.; Australian National Phenome Center, and Center for Computational and Systems Medicine, Health Futures Institute, Murdoch University, Harry Perkins Building, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Fiona Stanley Hospital, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.; Institute of Global Health Innovation, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Level 1, Faculty Building, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2NA, UK.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.; CIBERehd, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28029 Madrid, Spain.; Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.; CIBERehd, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28029 Madrid, Spain."

Supplementation of l-arginine may improve endothelial and muscle function by stimulating nitric oxide synthesis. A single-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in adults aged between 20 and 60 years with persistent fatigue attending a post-acute COVID-19 outpatient clinic. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive twice-daily orally either a combination of 1.66 g l-arginine plus 500 mg liposomal vitamin C or a placebo for 28 days. The primary outcome was the distance walked on the 6 min walk test. Secondary outcomes were handgrip strength, flow-mediated dilation, and fatigue persistence. Fifty participants were randomized to receive either l-arginine plus vitamin C or a placebo. Forty-six participants (median (interquartile range) age 51 (14), 30 [65%] women), 23 per group, received the intervention to which they were allocated and completed the study. At 28 days, l-arginine plus vitamin C increased the 6 min walk distance (+30 (40.5) m; placebo: +0 (75) m, p = 0.001) and induced a greater improvement in handgrip strength (+3.4 (7.5) kg) compared with the placebo (+1 (6.6) kg, p = 0.03). The flow-mediated dilation was greater in the active group than in the placebo (14.3% (7.3) vs. 9.4% (5.8), p = 0.03). At 28 days, fatigue was reported by two participants in the active group (8.7%) and 21 in the placebo group (80.1%; p < 0.0001). l-arginine plus vitamin C supplementation improved walking performance, muscle strength, endothelial function, and fatigue in adults with long COVID.

Herein, we perform an integrated analysis using 296 fecal metagenomes, 79 fecal metabolomics, viral load in 1378 respiratory tract samples, and clinical features of 133 COVID-19 patients prospectively followed for up to 6 months. Metagenomic-based clustering identifies two robust ecological clusters (hereafter referred to as Clusters 1 and 2), of which Cluster 1 is significantly associated with severe COVID-19 and the development of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Significant differences between clusters could be explained by both multi-kingdom ecological drivers (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) and host factors with a good predictive value and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98. A model combining host and microbial factors could predict the duration of respiratory viral shedding with 82.1% accuracy (error ± 3 days). These results highlight the potential utility of host phenotype and multi-kingdom microbiota profiling as a prognostic tool for patients with COVID-19.","2022","2022 Nov 10","Qin Liu; Qi Su; Fen Zhang;

"70","36355108","Signatures of Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Impaired Fatty Acid Metabolism in Plasma of Patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC).","Metabolites","","exercise intolerance; keyword post-acute sequelae of COVID-19; long COVID; metabolomics; plasma","Exercise intolerance is a major manifestation of post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection (PASC, or ""long-COVID""). Exercise intolerance in PASC is associated with higher arterial blood lactate accumulation and lower fatty acid oxidation rates during graded exercise tests to volitional exertion, suggesting altered metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. It remains unclear whether the profound disturbances in metabolism that have been identified in plasma from patients suffering from acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are also present in PASC. To bridge this gap, individuals with a history of previous acute COVID-19 infection that did not require hospitalization were enrolled at National Jewish Health (Denver, CO, USA) and were grouped into those that developed PASC (n = 29) and those that fully recovered (n = 16). Plasma samples from the two groups were analyzed via mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics and compared against plasma metabolic profiles of healthy control individuals (n = 30). Observational demographic and clinical data were retrospectively abstracted from the medical record. Compared to plasma of healthy controls or individuals who recovered from COVID-19, PASC plasma exhibited significantly higher free- and carnitine-conjugated mono-, poly-, and highly unsaturated fatty acids, accompanied by markedly lower levels of mono-, di- and tricarboxylates (pyruvate, lactate, citrate, succinate, and malate), polyamines (spermine) and taurine. Plasma from individuals who fully recovered from COVID-19 exhibited an intermediary metabolic phenotype, with milder disturbances in fatty acid metabolism and higher levels of spermine and taurine. Of note, depletion of tryptophan-a hallmark of disease severity in COVID-19-is not normalized in PASC patients, despite normalization of kynurenine levels-a tryptophan metabolite that predicts mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, PASC plasma metabolites are indicative of altered fatty acid metabolism and dysfunctional mitochondria-dependent lipid catabolism. These metabolic profiles obtained at rest are consistent with previously reported mitochondrial dysfunction during exercise, and may pave the way for therapeutic intervention focused on restoring mitochondrial fat-burning capacity.","2022","2022 Oct 26","Vamsi P Guntur; Travis Nemkov; Esther de Boer; Michael P Mohning; David Baraghoshi; Francesca I Cendali; Inigo San-Millán; Irina Petrache; Angelo D'Alessandro","Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO 80206, USA.; Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Department of Biochemical and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO 80206, USA.; Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO 80206, USA.; Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO 80206, USA.; Department of Biochemical and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Department of Human Physiology and Nutrition, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO 80918, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO 80206, USA.; Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.; Department of Biochemical and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA."

The aim of the present investigation was to determine the validity of the physiological response to dehydration known as aestivation and its relevance for long-term disease outcome in COVID-19. The study includes 374 COVID-19 patients from the Pronmed cohort admitted to the ICU at Uppsala University Hospital. Dehydration data was available for 165 of these patients and used for the primary analysis. Validation was performed in Biobanque Québécoise de la COVID-19 (BQC19) using 1052 patients with dehydration data. Dehydration was assessed through estimated osmolality (eOSM = 2Na + 2 K + glucose + urea), and correlated to important endpoints including death, invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury, and long COVID-19 symptom score grouped by physical or mental. Increasing eOSM was correlated with increasing role of organic osmolytes for eOSM, while the proportion of sodium and potassium of eOSM were inversely correlated to eOSM. Acute outcomes were associated with pronounced dehydration, and physical long-COVID was more strongly associated with dehydration than mental long-COVID after adjustment for age, sex, and disease severity. Metabolomic analysis showed enrichment of amino acids among metabolites that showed an aestivating pattern. Dehydration during acute COVID-19 infection causes an aestivation response that is associated with protein degradation and physical long-COVID.

Our objective was to provide comprehensive insights into the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 and to identify liquid biomarkers for disease severity and therapy response. We studied a total of 85 lungs (n = 31 COVID autopsy samples; n = 7 influenza A autopsy samples; n = 18 interstitial lung disease explants; n = 24 healthy controls) using the highest resolution Synchrotron radiation-based hierarchical phase-contrast tomography, scanning electron microscopy of microvascular corrosion casts, immunohistochemistry, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging, and analysis of mRNA expression and biological pathways. Plasma samples from all disease groups were used for liquid biomarker determination using ELISA. The anatomic/molecular data were analyzed as a function of patients' hospitalization time. The observed patchy/mosaic appearance of COVID-19 in conventional lung imaging resulted from microvascular occlusion and secondary lobular ischemia. The length of hospitalization was associated with increased intussusceptive angiogenesis. This was associated with enhanced angiogenic, and fibrotic gene expression demonstrated by molecular profiling and metabolomic analysis. Increased plasma fibrosis markers correlated with their pulmonary tissue transcript levels and predicted disease severity. Plasma analysis confirmed distinct fibrosis biomarkers (TSP2, GDF15, IGFBP7, Pro-C3) that predicted the fatal trajectory in COVID-19. Pulmonary severe COVID-19 is a consequence of secondary lobular microischemia and fibrotic remodelling, resulting in a distinctive form of fibrotic interstitial lung disease that contributes to long-COVID.

The effective prevention and control of COVID-19 has resulted in a considerable increase in the number of cured cases. However, little research has been done on a complete metabonomic examination of metabolic alterations in COVID-19 patients following treatment. The current project pursues rigorously to characterize the variation of serum metabolites between healthy controls and COVID-19 patients with nucleic acid turning negative via untargeted metabolomics. Methods: The metabolic difference between 20 COVID-19 patients (CT ≥ 35) and 20 healthy controls were investigated utilizing untargeted metabolomics analysis employing High-resolution UHPLC-MS/MS. COVID-19 patients' fundamental clinical indicators, as well as health controls, were also collected. Results: Out of the 714 metabolites identified, 203 still significantly differed between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, including multiple amino acids, fatty acids, and glycerophospholipids. The clinical indexes including monocytes, lymphocytes, albumin concentration, total bilirubin and direct bilirubin have also differed between our two groups of participators. Conclusion: Our results clearly showed that in COVID-19 patients with nucleic acid turning negative, their metabolism was still dysregulated in amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism, which could be the mechanism of long-COVID and calls for specific post-treatment care to help COVID-19 patients recover.","2022","2022","Wenyu Chen; Ming Yao; Miaomiao Chen; Zhao Ou; Qi Yang; Yanbin He; Ning Zhang; Min Deng; Yuqi Wu; Rongchang Chen; Xiaoli Tan; Ziqing Kong","Department of Respiration, Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, Jiaxing, China.; Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, Jiaxing, China.; Key Laboratory of Digital Technology in Medical Diagnostics of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.; Key Laboratory of Digital Technology in Medical Diagnostics of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Respiration, Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, Jiaxing, China.; Key Laboratory of Digital Technology in Medical Diagnostics of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Hepatic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.; Department of Infection, Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, Jiaxing, China.; Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, Hangzhou, China.; Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Respiration, Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, Jiaxing, China.; Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, Hangzhou, China."

The association between neutralizing antibody levels and metabolic alterations in convalescent patients with COVID-19 is still poorly understood. In the present work, we conducted absolutely quantitative profiling to compare the plasma cytokines and metabolome of ordinary convalescent patients with antibodies (CA), convalescents with rapidly faded antibodies (CO), and healthy subjects. As a result, we identified that cytokines such as M-CSF and IL-12p40 and plasma metabolites such as glycylproline (gly-pro) and long-chain acylcarnitines could be associated with antibody fading in COVID-19 convalescent patients. Following feature selection, we built machine-learning-based classification models using 17 features (six cytokines and 11 metabolites). Overall accuracies of more than 90% were attained in at least six machine-learning models. Of note, the dipeptide gly-pro, a product of enzymatic peptide cleavage catalyzed by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), strongly accumulated in CO individuals compared with the CA group. Furthermore, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination experiments in healthy mice demonstrated that supplementation of gly-pro down-regulates SARS-CoV-2-specific receptor-binding domain antibody levels and suppresses immune responses, whereas the DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin can counteract the inhibitory effects of gly-pro upon SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Our findings not only reveal the important role of gly-pro in the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection but also indicate a possible mechanism underlying the beneficial outcomes of treatment with DPP4 inhibitors in convalescent COVID-19 patients, shedding light on therapeutic and vaccination strategies against COVID-19.","2022","2022 Aug 23","Zhu Yang; Di Wu; Shanxin Lu; Yang Qiu; Zhengyi Hua; Fancheng Tan; Cixiong Zhang; Lei Zhang; Ding-Yu Zhang; Xi Zhou; Zongwei Cai; You Shang; Shu-Hai Lin","State Key Laboratory for Cellular Stress Biology, School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Fujian 361102, China.; National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine, Xiamen University, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory of Environmental and Biological Analysis, Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong SAR, China.; State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China.; Joint Laboratory of Infectious Diseases and Health, Wuhan Institute of Virology-Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan 430023, China.; State Key Laboratory for Cellular Stress Biology, School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Fujian 361102, China.; National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine, Xiamen University, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China.; Joint Laboratory of Infectious Diseases and Health, Wuhan Institute of Virology-Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan 430023, China.; State Key Laboratory for Cellular Stress Biology, School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Fujian 361102, China.; National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine, Xiamen University, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory for Cellular Stress Biology, School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Fujian 361102, China.; National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine, Xiamen University, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory for Cellular Stress Biology, School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Fujian 361102, China.; State Key Laboratory for Cellular Stress Biology, School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Fujian 361102, China.; Joint Laboratory of Infectious Diseases and Health, Wuhan Institute of Virology-Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan 430023, China.; Center for Translational Medicine, Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan 430023, China.; State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China.; Joint Laboratory of Infectious Diseases and Health, Wuhan Institute of Virology-Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan 430023, China.; Center for Translational Medicine, Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan 430023, China.; State Key Laboratory of Environmental and Biological Analysis, Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Joint Laboratory of Infectious Diseases and Health, Wuhan Institute of Virology-Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan 430023, China.; Center for Translational Medicine, Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan 430023, China.; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.; State Key Laboratory for Cellular Stress Biology, School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Fujian 361102, China.; National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine, Xiamen University, Fujian 361102, China."

Two key areas of investigation that are still unclear are: the molecular mechanisms that lead to heterogenic patient outcomes, and the causes of Post COVID condition (AKA Long-COVID). In this paper, we introduce the HYGIEIA project, designed to respond to the enormous challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic through a multi-omic approach supported by network medicine. It is hoped that in addition to investigating COVID-19, the logistics deployed within this project will be applicable to other infectious agents, pandemic-type situations, and also other complex, non-infectious diseases. Here, we first look at previous research into COVID-19 in the context of the proteome, metabolome, transcriptome, microbiome, host genome, and viral genome. We then discuss a proposed methodology for a large-scale multi-omic longitudinal study to investigate the aforementioned biological strata through high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and mass-spectrometry (MS) technologies. Lastly, we discuss how a network medicine approach can be used to analyze the data and make meaningful discoveries, with the final aim being the translation of these discoveries into the clinics to improve patient care.","2022","2022 Jun 23","Bradley Ward; Jean Cyr Yombi; Jean-Luc Balligand; Patrice D Cani; Jean-François Collet; Julien de Greef; Joseph P Dewulf; Laurent Gatto; Vincent Haufroid; Sébastien Jodogne; Benoît Kabamba; Sébastien Pyr Dit Ruys; Didier Vertommen; Laure Elens; Leïla Belkhir","Integrated Pharmacometrics, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacokinetics Group (PMGK), Louvain Drug Research Institute (LDRI), UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Louvain Center for Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (LTAP), Institut de Recherche Expérimentale et Clinique (IREC), UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Internal Medicine, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), Pole of Pharmacology and Therapeutics (FATH), Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique (IREC), Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Louvain Drug Research Institute (LDRI), UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), de Duve Institute, UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Louvain Center for Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (LTAP), Institut de Recherche Expérimentale et Clinique (IREC), UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Internal Medicine, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Louvain Center for Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (LTAP), Institut de Recherche Expérimentale et Clinique (IREC), UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Biochemistry, de Duve Institute, UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Unit (CBIO), de Duve Institute, UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Louvain Center for Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (LTAP), Institut de Recherche Expérimentale et Clinique (IREC), UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Computer Science and Engineering Department (INGI), Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics (ICTEAM), UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Pôle de Microbiologie, Institut de Recherche Expérimentale et Clinique, UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Integrated Pharmacometrics, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacokinetics Group (PMGK), Louvain Drug Research Institute (LDRI), UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; De Duve Institute, and MASSPROT Platform, UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Integrated Pharmacometrics, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacokinetics Group (PMGK), Louvain Drug Research Institute (LDRI), UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Louvain Center for Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (LTAP), Institut de Recherche Expérimentale et Clinique (IREC), UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Louvain Center for Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (LTAP), Institut de Recherche Expérimentale et Clinique (IREC), UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.; Department of Internal Medicine, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, UCLouvain, Université Catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium."

The technology is based on Raman spectroscopy and computational analysis. It does not detect SARS-CoV-2 virus or viral components, but rather a urine 'molecular fingerprint', representing systemic metabolic, inflammatory, and immunologic reactions to infection. We analyzed voided urine specimens from 46 symptomatic COVID-19 patients with positive real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for infection or household contact with test-positive patients. We compared their urine Raman spectra with urine Raman spectra from healthy individuals (n = 185), peritoneal dialysis patients (n = 20), and patients with active bladder cancer (n = 17), collected between 2016-2018 (i.e., pre-COVID-19). We also compared all urine Raman spectra with urine specimens collected from healthy, fully vaccinated volunteers (n = 19) from July to September 2021. Disease severity (primarily respiratory) ranged among mild (n = 25), moderate (n = 14), and severe (n = 7). Seventy percent of patients sought evaluation within 14 days of onset. One severely affected patient was hospitalized, the remainder being managed with home/ambulatory care. Twenty patients had clinical pathology profiling. Seven of 20 patients had mildly elevated serum creatinine values (>0.9 mg/dl; range 0.9-1.34 mg/dl) and 6/7 of these patients also had estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73m2 (range 59-84 mL/min/1.73m2). We could not determine if any of these patients had antecedent clinical pathology abnormalities. Our technology (Raman Chemometric Urinalysis-Rametrix®) had an overall prediction accuracy of 97.6% for detecting complex, multimolecular fingerprints in urine associated with COVID-19 disease. The sensitivity of this model for detecting COVID-19 was 90.9%. The specificity was 98.8%, the positive predictive value was 93.0%, and the negative predictive value was 98.4%. In assessing severity, the method showed to be accurate in identifying symptoms as mild, moderate, or severe (random chance = 33%) based on the urine multimolecular fingerprint. Finally, a fingerprint of 'Long COVID-19' symptoms (defined as lasting longer than 30 days) was located in urine. Our methods were able to locate the presence of this fingerprint with 70.0% sensitivity and 98.7% specificity in leave-one-out cross-validation analysis. Further validation testing will include sampling more patients, examining correlations of disease severity and/or duration, and employing metabolomic analysis (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry [GC-MS], High Performance Liquid Chromatography [HPLC]) to identify individual components contributing to COVID-19 molecular fingerprints.","2022","2022","John L Robertson; Ryan S Senger; Janine Talty; Pang Du; Amr Sayed-Issa; Maggie L Avellar; Lacey T Ngo; Mariana Gomez De La Espriella; Tasaduq N Fazili; Jasmine Y Jackson-Akers; Georgi Guruli; Giuseppe Orlando","Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics, College of Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.; Section of Nephrology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America.; DialySensors Incorporated, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.; DialySensors Incorporated, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.; Department of Biological Systems Engineering, College of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.; Department of Chemical Engineering, College of Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.; Clinical Biomechanics and Orthopedic Medicine, Roanoke, Virginia, United States of America.; DialySensors Incorporated, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.; Department of Statistics, College of Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.; DialySensors Incorporated, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.; DialySensors Incorporated, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.; Department of Biological Systems Engineering, College of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.; DialySensors Incorporated, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.; Internal Medicine/Infectious Disease, Carilion Clinic, Roanoke, Virginia, United States of America.; Internal Medicine/Infectious Disease, Carilion Clinic, Roanoke, Virginia, United States of America.; Internal Medicine/Infectious Disease, Carilion Clinic, Roanoke, Virginia, United States of America.; Division of Surgical Urology/Urologic Oncology, Department of Surgery, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, United States of America.; Department of Surgery, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America."

With incidence ranging between 31% and 69%, PACS is becoming increasingly acknowledged as a new disease state in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect several organ systems to varying degrees and durations, the cellular and molecular abnormalities contributing to PACS pathogenesis remain unclear. Despite our limited understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes this persistent disease state, mitochondrial dysfunction has been increasingly recognized as a contributing factor to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and, more recently, to PACS pathogenesis. The biological mechanisms contributing to this phenomena have not been well established in previous literature; however, in this review, we summarize the evidence that NAD+ metabolome disruption and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction following SARS-CoV-2 genome integration may contribute to PACS biological pathogenesis. We also briefly examine the coordinated and complex relationship between increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction and speculate as to how SARS-CoV-2-mediated NAD+ depletion may be causing these abnormalities in PACS. As such, we present evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of intravenous administration of NAD+ as a novel treatment intervention for PACS symptom management.","2022","2022 Jan-Dec","Tabitha Block; Jonathann Kuo","Hudson Medical Group, New York, NY, USA.; Hudson Medical Group, New York, NY, USA."

Metabolomic studies in COVID-19 patients is worth exploring for further available screening methods. In our study, we recruited a study cohort of 350 subjects comprising 248 COVID-19 patients (161 non-severe cases, 60 asymptomatic cases, and 27 severe cases) and 102 healthy controls (HCs), and herein present data with respect to their demographic features, urinary metabolome, immunological indices, and follow-up health status. We found that COVID-19 resulted in alterations of 39 urinary, mainly microbial, metabolites. Using random forest analysis, a simplified marker panel including three microbial metabolites (oxoglutaric acid, indoxyl, and phenylacetamide) was constructed (AUC=0.963, 95% CI, 0.930-0.983), which exhibited higher diagnostic performance than immune feature-based panels between COVID-19 and HC groups (P<0.0001). Meanwhile, we observed that urine metabolic markers enabled discriminating asymptomatic patients (ASY) from HCs (AUC = 0.981, 95% CI, 0.946-0.996), and predicting the incidence of high-risk sequalae in COVID-19 individuals (AUC=0.931, 95% CI, 0.877-0.966). Co-expression network analysis showed that 13 urinary microbial metabolites (e.g., oxoglutaric acid) were significantly correlated with alterations of CD4+, CD3+, and CD8+ T-cells, as well as IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-4 levels, suggesting close interactions between microbial metabolites and host immune dysregulation in COVID-19.

Studies have suggested that systemic alterations persist in a considerable proportion of COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge. We used proteomic and metabolomic approaches to analyze plasma samples obtained from 30 healthy subjects and 54 COVID-19 survivors 6 months after discharge from the hospital, including 30 non-severe and 24 severe patients. Through this analysis, we identified 1019 proteins and 1091 metabolites. The differentially expressed proteins and metabolites were then subjected to Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. Among the patients evaluated, 41% of COVID-19 survivors reported at least one clinical symptom and 26.5% showed lung imaging abnormalities at 6 months after discharge. Plasma proteomics and metabolomics analysis showed that COVID-19 survivors differed from healthy control subjects in terms of the extracellular matrix, immune response, and hemostasis pathways. COVID-19 survivors also exhibited abnormal lipid metabolism, disordered immune response, and changes in pulmonary fibrosis-related proteins. COVID-19 survivors show persistent proteomic and metabolomic abnormalities 6 months after discharge from the hospital. Hence, the recovery period for COVID-19 survivors may be longer.","2022","2022 Mar 14","Hongwei Li; Xue Li; Qian Wu; Xing Wang; Zhonghua Qin; Yaguo Wang; Yanbin He; Qi Wu; Li Li; Huaiyong Chen","Department of Respiratory Medicine, Haihe Hospital, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.; Department of Basic Medicine, Haihe Hospital, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.; Department of Basic Medicine, Haihe Clinical School, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, Haihe Hospital, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, Haihe Hospital, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Haihe Hospital, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.; Key Laboratory of RNA Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.; Key Laboratory of RNA Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.; Key Research Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention for State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Tianjin, China. wq572004@163.com.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, Haihe Hospital, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China. lily20060718@163.com.; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Lung Regenerative Medicine, Tianjin, China. lily20060718@163.com.; Department of Basic Medicine, Haihe Hospital, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China. huaiyong.chen@foxmail.com.; Department of Basic Medicine, Haihe Clinical School, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China. huaiyong.chen@foxmail.com.; Key Research Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention for State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Tianjin, China. huaiyong.chen@foxmail.com.; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Lung Regenerative Medicine, Tianjin, China. huaiyong.chen@foxmail.com."

Here we consider the evidence on whether the specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) are ready to meet this challenge as well as targeted metabololipidomics of the resolution-inflammation metabolomes. Specific stereochemical mechanisms in the biosynthesis of SPMs from omega-3 essential fatty acids give rise to unique local-acting lipid mediators. SPMs possess stereochemically defined potent bioactive structures that are high-affinity ligands for cognate G protein-coupled surface receptors that evoke the cellular responses required for efficient resolution of acute inflammation. The SPMs biosynthesized from the major omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are coined Resolvins (resolution phase interaction products; E series and D-series), Protectins and Maresins (macrophage mediators in resolving inflammation). Their biosynthesis and stereochemical assignments are established and confirmed (>1,441 resolvin publications in PubMed.gov) as well as their functional roles on innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells (both lymphocyte T-cell subsets and B-cells). The resolution of a protective acute inflammatory response is governed mainly by phagocytes that actively clear apoptotic cells, debris, blood clots and pathogens. These resolution phase functions of the acute inflammatory response are enhanced by SPMs, which together prepare the inflammatory loci for homeostasis and stimulate tissue regeneration via activating stem cells and the biosynthesis of novel cys-SPMs (e.g. MCTRs, PCTRs and RCTRs). These cys-SPMs also activate regeneration, are organ protective and stimulate resolution of local inflammation. Herein, we review the biosynthesis and functions of the E-series resolvins, namely resolvin E1 (the first n-3 resolvin identified), resolvin E2, resolvin E3 and resolvin E4 biosynthesized from their precursor eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and the critical role of total organic synthesis in confirming SPM complete stereochemistry, establishing their potent functions in resolution of inflammation, and novel structures. The physical properties of each biologically derived SPM, i.e., ultra-violet (UV) absorbance, chromatographic behavior, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) fragmentation, were matched to SPMs biosynthesized and prepared by stereospecific total organic synthesis. We briefly review this approach, also used with the endogenous D-series resolvins, protectins and maresins confirming their potent functions in resolution of inflammation, that paves the way for their rigorous evaluation in human tissues and clinical trials. The assignment of complete stereochemistry for each of the E and D series Resolvins, Protectins and Maresins was a critical and required step that enabled human clinical studies as in SPM profiling in COVID-19 infections and experimental animal disease models that also opened the promise of resolution physiology, resolution pharmacology and targeted precision nutrition as new areas for monitoring health and disease mechanisms.","2022","2022 Jan","Charles N Serhan; Stephania Libreros; Robert Nshimiyimana","Center for Experimental Therapeutics and Reperfusion Injury, Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

We resolved four PASC-anticipating risk factors at the time of initial COVID-19 diagnosis: type 2 diabetes, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and specific auto-antibodies. In patients with gastrointestinal PASC, SARS-CoV-2-specific and CMV-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited unique dynamics during recovery from COVID-19. Analysis of symptom-associated immunological signatures revealed coordinated immunity polarization into four endotypes, exhibiting divergent acute severity and PASC.

The supplementation with probiotic (OB) would have a positive effect on metabolic homeostasis, negatively impacting the occurrence of symptoms related to the CNS after hospital discharge. On a total of 58 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 24 (41.4%) received OB during hospitalization (OB+) while 34 (58.6%) taken only the standard treatment (OB-). Serum metabolomic profiling of patients has been performed at both hospital acceptance (T0) and discharge (T1). Six months after discharge, fatigue perceived by participants was assessed by administrating the Fatigue Assessment Scale. 70.7% of participants reported fatigue while 29.3% were negative for such condition. The OB+ group showed a significantly lower proportion of subjects reporting fatigue than the OB- one (p < 0.01). Furthermore, OB+ subjects were characterized by significantly increased concentrations of serum Arginine, Asparagine, Lactate opposite to lower levels of 3-Hydroxyisobutirate than those not treated with probiotics. Our results strongly suggest that in COVID-19, the administration of probiotics during hospitalization may prevent the development of chronic fatigue by impacting key metabolites involved in the utilization of glucose as well as in energy pathways.","2021","2021","Letizia Santinelli; Luca Laghi; Giuseppe Pietro Innocenti; Claudia Pinacchio; Paolo Vassalini; Luigi Celani; Alessandro Lazzaro; Cristian Borrazzo; Massimiliano Marazzato; Lorenzo Tarsitani; Alexia E Koukopoulos; Claudio M Mastroianni; Gabriella d'Ettorre; Giancarlo Ceccarelli","Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.; Interdepartmental Centre for Agri-Food Industrial Research, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Human Neurosciences, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Human Neurosciences, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."

Symptoms also include cognitive and sensory dysfunction, sleeping disturbances, orthostatic intolerance, and gastrointestinal problems. A syndrome clinically similar to ME/CFS has been reported following well-documented infections with the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. At least 10% of COVID-19 survivors develop post acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Although many individuals with PASC have evidence of structural organ damage, a subset have symptoms consistent with ME/CFS including fatigue, post exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, gastrointestinal disturbances, and postural orthostatic intolerance. These common features in ME/CFS and PASC suggest that insights into the pathogenesis of either may enrich our understanding of both syndromes, and could expedite the development of strategies for identifying those at risk and interventions that prevent or mitigate disease. Using regression, Bayesian and enrichment analyses, we conducted targeted and untargeted metabolomic analysis of 888 metabolic analytes in plasma samples of 106 ME/CFS cases and 91 frequency-matched healthy controls. In ME/CFS cases, regression, Bayesian and enrichment analyses revealed evidence of peroxisomal dysfunction with decreased levels of plasmalogens. Other findings included decreased levels of several membrane lipids, including phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins, that may indicate dysregulation of the cytidine-5â€™-diphosphocholine pathway. Enrichment analyses revealed decreased levels of choline, ceramides and carnitines, and increased levels of long chain triglycerides (TG) and hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid. Elevated levels of dicarboxylic acids were consistent with abnormalities in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Using machine learning algorithms with selected metabolites as predictors, we were able to differentiate female ME/CFS cases from female controls (highest AUC=0.794) and ME/CFS cases without self-reported irritable bowel syndrome (sr-IBS) from controls without sr-IBS (highest AUC=0.873). Our findings are consistent with earlier ME/CFS work indicating compromised energy metabolism and redox imbalance, and highlight new abnormalities that may provide insights into the pathogenesis of ME/CFS. Plasma levels of plasmalogens are decreased in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome suggesting peroxisome dysfunction.","2022","2022 Jan 11","Xiaoyu Che; Christopher R Brydges; Yuanzhi Yu; Adam Price; Shreyas Joshi; Ayan Roy; Bohyun Lee; Dinesh K Barupal; Aaron Cheng; Dana March Palmer; Susan Levine; Daniel L Peterson; Suzanne D Vernon; Lucinda Bateman; Mady Hornig; Jose G Montoya; Anthony L Komaroff; Oliver Fiehn; W Ian Lipkin","Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health; Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University; New York, NY, United States.; UC Davis Genome Center - Metabolomics, University of California, Davis; Davis, CA, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University; New York, NY, United States.; Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health; Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health; Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health; Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health; Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; New York, United States.; Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health; Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University; New York, NY, United States.; Levine Clinic; New York, NY, United States.; Sierra Internal Medicine at Incline Village; Incline Village, NV, United States.; Bateman Horne Center; Salt Lake City, UT, United States.; Bateman Horne Center; Salt Lake City, UT, United States.; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University; New York, NY, United States.; Sutter Health Palo Alto Medical Foundation; Palo Alto, CA, United States.; Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital; Boston, MA, United States.; UC Davis Genome Center - Metabolomics, University of California, Davis; Davis, CA, United States.; Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health; Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."

However, extrapulmonary pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and post-COVID sequelae remain to be understood. Here, we show, using a hamster model, that the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to an acute inflammatory response and lung pathologies, while the late phase of infection causes cardiovascular complications (CVCs) characterized by ventricular wall thickening associated with increased ventricular mass/body mass ratio and interstitial coronary fibrosis. Molecular profiling further substantiated our findings of CVC as SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters showed elevated levels of serum cardiac troponin I, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and long-chain fatty acid triglycerides. Serum metabolomics profiling of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters identified N-acetylneuraminate, a functional metabolite found to be associated with CVC, as a metabolic marker was found to be common between SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters and COVID-19 patients. Together, we propose hamsters as a suitable animal model to study post-COVID sequelae associated with CVC, which could be extended to therapeutic interventions.","2022","2022 Jan 11","Zaigham Abbas Rizvi; Rajdeep Dalal; Srikanth Sadhu; Akshay Binayke; Jyotsna Dandotiya; Yashwant Kumar; Tripti Shrivastava; Sonu Kumar Gupta; Suruchi Aggarwal; Manas Ranjan Tripathy; Deepak Kumar Rathore; Amit Kumar Yadav; Guruprasad R Medigeshi; Amit Kumar Pandey; Sweety Samal; Shailendra Asthana; Amit Awasthi","Immuno-biology Lab, Infection and Immunology Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Immunology Core, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Immuno-biology Lab, Infection and Immunology Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Immuno-biology Lab, Infection and Immunology Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Immuno-biology Lab, Infection and Immunology Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Immuno-biology Lab, Infection and Immunology Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Non-communicable Disease Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Infection and Immunology Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Non-communicable Disease Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Non-communicable Disease Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Immuno-biology Lab, Infection and Immunology Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Infection and Immunology Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Non-communicable Disease Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Infection and Immunology Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Infection and Immunology Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Infection and Immunology Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Non-communicable Disease Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Immuno-biology Lab, Infection and Immunology Centre, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India.; Immunology Core, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR-Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad, India."

All patients had no underlying kidney disease before admission. At patient recruitment, renal function assessment, laboratory examination, chest computed tomography (CT) were performed. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect metabolites in the plasma. We analyzed the longitudinally change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on serum creatinine and cystatin-c levels using the CKD-EPI equation and explored the metabolomic differences in patients with different eGFR change patterns from hospitalization to 3 months after discharge. Lung CT showed good recovery; however, the median eGFR significantly decreased at the 3-month follow-up. Among the 89 severely ill COVID-19 patients, 69 (77.5%) showed abnormal eGFR (<90 mL/min per 1.73 m2) at 3 months after discharge. Age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.47, p = 0.003), body mass index (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.20-3.22, p = 0.007), and cystatin-c level (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.07-1.39, p = 0.003) at discharge were independent risk factors for post-discharge abnormal eGFR. Plasma metabolomics at the 3-months follow-up revealed that β-pseudouridine, uridine, and 2-(dimethylamino) guanosine levels gradually increased with an abnormal degree of eGFR. Moreover, the kynurenine pathway in tryptophan metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis were also perturbed in survivors with abnormal eGFR.","2022","2022 Jan 01","Mei Zhou; Xueyun Tan; Ping Luo; Juanjuan Xu; Zhengrong Yin; Tingting Liao; Sufei Wang; Zhihui Wang; Yang Jin","Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Rd, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Rd, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China.; Department of Translational Medicine Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Rd, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Rd, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Rd, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Rd, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China.; Department of Scientific Research, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Rd, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China.

The role of micronutrient status and metabolic health emerge as pivotal in COVID-19 pathogenesis and the immune system's response. Metabolic disruption, proceeding from modifiable factors, has been proposed as a significant risk factor accounting for infection susceptibility, disease severity and risk for post-COVID complications. Metabolomics, the comprehensive study and quantification of intermediates and products of metabolism, is a rapidly evolving field and a novel tool in biomarker discovery. In this article, we propose that leveraging insulin resistance biomarkers along with biomarkers of micronutrient deficiencies, will allow for a diagnostic window and provide functional therapeutic targets. Specifically, metabolomics can be applied as: a. At-home test to assess the risk of infection and propose nutritional support, b. A screening tool for high-risk COVID-19 patients to develop serious illness during hospital admission and prioritize medical support, c(i). A tool to match nutritional support with specific nutrient requirements for mildly ill patients to reduce the risk for hospitalization, and c(ii). for critically ill patients to reduce recovery time and risk of post-COVID complications, d. At-home test to monitor metabolic health and reduce post-COVID symptomatology. Metabolic rewiring offers potential virtues towards disease prevention, dissection of high-risk patients, taking actionable therapeutic measures, as well as shielding against post-COVID syndrome.","2021","2021 Aug","Dimitris Tsoukalas; Evangelia Sarandi; Spyridoula Georgaki","European Institute of Nutritional Medicine, 00198 Rome, Italy; Metabolomic Medicine, Health Clinic for Autoimmune and Chronic Diseases, 10674 Athens, Greece.

Using easy-to-apply questionnaires and scales (often by telephone interviewing), several studies evaluated samples of COVID-19 inpatients from 4 weeks to several months after discharge. However, studies conducting systematic multidisciplinary assessments of PASC manifestations are scarce, with thorough in-person objective evaluations restricted to modestly sized subsamples presenting greatest disease severity. We will conduct a prospective observational study of surviving individuals (above 18 years of age) from a cohort of over 3000 subjects with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were treated as inpatients at the largest academic health centre in Sao Paulo, Brazil (Hospital das Clínicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de São Paulo). All eligible subjects will be consecutively invited to undergo a 1-2-day series of multidisciplinary assessments at 2 time-points, respectively, at 6-9 months and 12-15 months after discharge. Assessment schedules will include detailed multidomain questionnaires applied by medical research staff, self-report scales, objective evaluations of cardiopulmonary functioning, physical functionality and olfactory status, standardised neurological, psychiatric and cognitive examinations, as well as diagnostic laboratory, muscle ultrasound and chest imaging exams. Remaining material from blood tests will be incorporated by a local biobank for use in future investigations on inflammatory markers, genomics, transcriptomics, peptidomics and metabolomics. All components of this programme have been approved by local research ethics committees. We aim to provide insights into the frequency and severity of chronic/post-COVID multiorgan symptoms, as well as their interrelationships and associations with acute disease features, sociodemographic variables and environmental exposures. Findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific meetings. Additionally, we aim to provide a data repository to allow future pathophysiological investigations relating clinical PASC features to biomarker data extracted from blood samples.

Dysregulated metabolism might lead to excessive inflammatory and autoimmune responses as observed in severe and long COVID-19 patients. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 modulates cellular metabolism and reduces autophagy. Accordingly, compound-driven induction of autophagy limits SARS-CoV-2 propagation. In detail, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells show accumulation of key metabolites, activation of autophagy inhibitors (AKT1, SKP2) and reduction of proteins responsible for autophagy initiation (AMPK, TSC2, ULK1), membrane nucleation, and phagophore formation (BECN1, VPS34, ATG14), as well as autophagosome-lysosome fusion (BECN1, ATG14 oligomers). Consequently, phagophore-incorporated autophagy markers LC3B-II and P62 accumulate, which we confirm in a hamster model and lung samples of COVID-19 patients. Single-nucleus and single-cell sequencing of patient-derived lung and mucosal samples show differential transcriptional regulation of autophagy and immune genes depending on cell type, disease duration, and SARS-CoV-2 replication levels. Targeting of autophagic pathways by exogenous administration of the polyamines spermidine and spermine, the selective AKT1 inhibitor MK-2206, and the BECN1-stabilizing anthelmintic drug niclosamide inhibit SARS-CoV-2 propagation in vitro with IC50 values of 136.7, 7.67, 0.11, and 0.13 μM, respectively. Autophagy-inducing compounds reduce SARS-CoV-2 propagation in primary human lung cells and intestinal organoids emphasizing their potential as treatment options against COVID-19.","2021","2021 Jun 21","Nils C Gassen; Jan Papies; Thomas Bajaj; Jackson Emanuel; Frederik Dethloff; Robert Lorenz Chua; Jakob Trimpert; Nicolas Heinemann; Christine Niemeyer; Friderike Weege; Katja Hönzke; Tom Aschman; Daniel E Heinz; Katja Weckmann; Tim Ebert; Andreas Zellner; Martina Lennarz; Emanuel Wyler; Simon Schroeder; Anja Richter; Daniela Niemeyer; Karen Hoffmann; Thomas F Meyer; Frank L Heppner; Victor M Corman; Markus Landthaler; Andreas C Hocke; Markus Morkel; Nikolaus Osterrieder; Christian Conrad; Roland Eils; Helena Radbruch; Patrick Giavalisco; Christian Drosten; Marcel A Müller","Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bonn, Medical Faculty, Bonn, Germany. nils.gassen@ukbonn.de.; Institute of Virology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Charité, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bonn, Medical Faculty, Bonn, Germany.; Institute of Virology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Charité, Berlin, Germany.; Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing, Cologne, Germany.; Center for Digital Health, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) and Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Institute of Virology, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Institute of Virology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Charité, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bonn, Medical Faculty, Bonn, Germany.; Institute of Virology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Charité, Berlin, Germany.; Molecular Imaging of Immunoregulation, Medizinische Klinik m.S.

RRV is responsible for the highest prevalence of human disease cases associated with mosquito-borne transmission in Australia, and has long been a leading suspect in cases of post-viral fatigue syndromes, with extrapolation of this link to Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME). Research into RRV pathogenesis has revealed a number of immune evasion strategies, impressive for a virus with a genome size of 12 kb (plus strand RNA), which resonate with insights into viral pathogenesis broadly. Drawing from observations on RRV immune evasion, mechanisms of relevance to long term idiopathic fatigue are featured as a perspective on infection and eventual ME symptoms, which include considerations of; (1) selective pro-inflammatory gene suppression post antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of RRV infection, (2) Evidence from other virus families of immune disruption and evasion post-ADE, and (3) how virally-driven immune evasion may impact on mitochondrial function via target of rapamycin (TOR) complexes. In light of these RRV measures to counter the host immune - inflammatory responses, links to recent discoveries explaining cellular, immune and metabolomic markers of ME will be explored and discussed, with the implications for long-COVID post SARS-CoV-2 also considered. Compelling issues on the connections between virally-induced alterations in cytokine expression, for example, will be of particular interest in light of energy pathways, and how these perturbations manifest clinically.","2021","2021","Brett A Lidbury","National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, Research School of Population Health, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia."

We enrolled 103 recovered COVID-19 patients as well as 27 healthy donors, and performed pulmonary function tests, computerized tomography (CT) scans, laboratory examinations, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Plasma metabolite profiles of COVID-19 survivors with abnormal pulmonary function were different from those of healthy donors or subjects with normal pulmonary function. These alterations were associated with disease severity and mainly involved amino acid and glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways. Furthermore, increased levels of triacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholines, prostaglandin E2, arginine, and decreased levels of betain and adenosine were associated with pulmonary CO diffusing capacity and total lung capacity.
